NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON JUL 27 1998

SHIP REPORTS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY INCLUDING SCATTEROMETER WINDS
INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM JUST OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA HAS A WELL-
DEFINED SURFACE CIRCULATION AND WE ARE IDENTIFYING IT AS TROPICAL
DEPRESSION NUMBER ONE.

TRACKING OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS GIVES A MOTION OF 280/24.  THE 00Z
AVIATION MODEL RUN SHOWS STEERING CURRENTS MUCH WEAKER THAN 24 KNOTS
SO THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS REDUCED TO 280/20.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE LITTLE CHANGE IN MOTION OVER THE NEXT 72
HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES ALONG WITH THIS.

THERE WERE THREE SHIPS AT 06Z IN THIS SYSTEM SHOWING A CLOSED
CIRCULATION OF ABOUT 15 KNOTS.  HOWEVER THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF
DEEP CONVECTION AND THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS ESTIMATED AT 25 KNOTS.

THE SHIPS STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL SHOWS THAT
CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING...SSTS ARE PLENTY
WARM AND THERE IS LITTLE VERTICAL SHEAR TO INHIBIT DEVELOPMENT.

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS SHOWS THAT WHILE
THE LOW LEVEL CENTER REMAINS FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED...CONVECTION HAS
DIMINISHED AROUND THE CENTER.  THUS...THE INTENSITY WILL BE
MAINTAINED AT 25 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION
OF THE SYSTEM IS RATHER IMPRESSIVE WITH GOOD OUTFLOW ESTABLISHED
OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS...AND CALLS FOR SOME GRADUAL STRENGTHENING THROUGH THE
PERIOD.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SHIPS STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL
INTENSITY MODEL. 

RECENT SATELLITE FIXES PLACE THE CENTER A BIT FURTHER NORTHWARD... 
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/18 KNOTS.  A MID-LEVEL
RIDGE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD KEEP IT ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK THROUGH ABOUT 48 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE AVIATION MODEL
BRINGS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROF/LOW SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR 40W.    
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST SHOWS A GRADUAL DECELERATION DUE TO 
THIS FEATURE.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE DISCUSSION NUMBER   3
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON JUL 27 1998

THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION HAS A LARGE BUT ELONGATED ENVELOPE AND IT
LACKS OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  SINCE THE DEPRESSION IS
OVER WARM WATERS...THE OUTFLOW IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND HAS SUCH A
LARGE ENVELOPE...I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT...TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING.  
HOWEVER... SINCE THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM IN 12 HOURS AND
SHIPS MODEL BRINGS THE SYSTEM TO 49 KNOTS...ONLY A SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. 

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON IR IMAGES AND THE
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/18.  ALL OF THE MODELS
THAT DEPEND ON THE AVN FORECAST FIELDS TURN THE DEPRESSION TO THE
NORTHWEST BY 48 HOURS.  THIS TURN IS CAUSED BY A DEVELOPING
MID-LEVEL TROUGH AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WHICH IS FORECAST BY THE AVN. 
ON THE OTHER HAND...THE UK AND NOGAPS MODELS MAINTAIN MORE OF A 500
MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THAT PATTERN WOULD
SUGGEST A WEST TO WEST NORTHWEST TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS TO THE LEFT OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE BUT VERY CLOSE TO CLIPER.
THERE IS TIME TO ADJUST THE FORECAST TRACK MORE TO THE
NORTHWEST...IF NECESSARY.  

NOGAPS TRACKING ALGORITHM DROPS THE DEPRESSION IN 12 HOURS OR SO 
BUT AN INSPECTION OF LOW-LEVEL FIELDS FROM THE 12Z RUN...ONE CAN
OBSERVE A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOVING DISTURBANCE WHICH APPROACHES
THE LESSER ANTILLES IN 5 DAYS OR SO.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE DISCUSSION NUMBER   4
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT TUE JUL 28 1998

THE DEPRESSION HAS NOT BECOME ANY BETTER ORGANIZED...AND THE CLOUD
PATTERN REMAINS ELONGATED FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING FROM NEAR 30N 20W
SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR 20N 30W...WHICH MAY BE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DISTORTION OF THE CLOUD PATTERN.  MOREOVER THE CYCLONE IS STILL 
INVOLVED WITH THE LOW-LEVEL MONSOONAL FLOW FEEDING TOWARDS WESTERN
AFRICA.  THE ABOVE TWO FACTORS MAY BE PREVENTING THE DEPRESSION FROM
STRENGTHENING AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
RUN SHOWS THE UPPER TROUGH MIGRATING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AND A MORE
ANTICYCLONIC FLOW BUILDING OVER THE AREA OF THE DEPRESSION.  ALSO AS
THE DEPRESSION MOVES FARTHER WEST IT SHOULD ESCAPE FROM THE MONSOON
TROUGH AND PERHAPS ENCOUNTER BETTER LOW-LEVEL INFLOW.  ONLY TIME
WILL TELL OF COURSE.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND CALLS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING...BUT ONE SHOULD
BEAR IN MIND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EXCEEDINGLY LIMITED SKILL IN
INTENSITY PREDICTION.

IT IS NOT EASY TO FIX A CENTER FROM INFRARED IMAGERY...BUT THE BEST
ESTIMATE IS THAT THE FORWARD MOTION HAS SLOWED A LITTLE MORE.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THAT FROM THE LAST ADVISORY
BUT SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THIS IS CLOSEST TO THE SHALLOW-LAYER STEERING.

IF THE SYSTEM WERE TO STRENGTHEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN
FORECAST...IT WOULD LIKELY TURN MORE NORTHWESTWARD IN RESPONSE TO
THE HIGHER-LEVEL TROUGH TO ITS NORTH.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/17...SAME AS LAST ADVISORY.  THE
00Z RUN OF THE AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE DEPRESSION TURNING TOWARD
THE NORTH-NORTHWEST IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS...APPARENTLY FINDING A
WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE.  THE UKMET SHOWS
MORE OF A WEST-NORTHEWESTWARD TRACK WHILE THE NOGAPS AND GFDL MODELS
LOSE THE CIRCULATION BY 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND
OF ALL OF THE GUIDANCE AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...
CALLING FOR A SLIGHT TURN TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND SOME
DECELERATION.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A FAIRLY-WELL ORGANIZED LOW LEVEL
CIRCULATION BUT THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED THIS MORNING. 
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE FROM T NUMBERS 2.0 TO 2.5.  THE
WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 30 KNOTS AND GRADUAL STRENGHENING IS
FORECAST AS THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF STRONG VERTICAL WIND SHEAR DURING

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/21 AND THIS IS SOMEWHAT FASTER
THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE
DEPRESSION TURNING TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHWEST INTO A WEAKNESS IN THE
SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE...THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME SCENARIO
AS THE 00Z MODEL RUN AND ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE
SIMILAR TO THE LAST PACKAGE.  SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY EXCEPT A LITTLE FASTER DURING THE
FIRST 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY CONSIDERABLE DECELERATION.  AS
BEFORE...THE GFDL AND NOGAPS MODELS LOSE THE CIRCULATION IN 24
HOURS.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A WELL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CLOUD STRUCTURE AND
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE AT MINIMAL TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH WHILE KGWC GAVE A 2.0 T NUMBER.   HOWEVER I PREFER TO
WAIT FOR THE APPEARANCE OF SOME MORE DEEP CONVECTION BEFORE
UPGRADING TO A TROPICAL STORM.  THE FORECAST...AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...IS FOR GRADUAL STRENGTHENING FOLLOWING THE SHIPS
STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL.  

THIS SYSTEM IS FAIRLY LARGE AND THE WIND SPEED RADII IN THE
FORECAST/ADVISORY ARE INCREASED A LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS BLOSSOMED A LITTLE THIS EVENING NEAR THE
CIRCULATION CENTER AND IN A BAND IN THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THIS
DEVELOPMENT...ALONG WITH TAFB AND SAB GIVING DVORAK TECHNIQUE
T-NUMBERS OF 2.5...SUPPORT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM
ALEX WITH 35 KT WINDS.  THE SPURT IN FORWARD SPEED NOTED EARLIER
TODAY SEEMS TO HAVE ENDED AND INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT
280/18 KT.
 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION WITH MULTIPLE
VORTICES TO THE NORTH TO NE OF THE TROPICAL STORM.  THE 12Z AVN
HAS THIS FEATURE PRIMARILY IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE...PERHAPS MOST
DISTINCT NEAR 300 MB.  AT 500 MB...IT SHOWS A WESTWARD RETROGRESSION
OF AN ANTICYCLONE FROM 35-40W TO 55-60W OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS...BUT
INDICATES THAT THE HIGH WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT ALEX
FROM GRADUALLY ACQUIRING A GREATER NORTHWARD COMPONENT.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT IDEA...AS IS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
WHICH IS A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.  FURTHER
DECELERATION IS ALSO PREDICTED.  ALTERNATELY...THE 12Z NOGAPS SHOWS
THE RETROGRADING HIGH TO BE STRONGER...AND KEEPS THE STORM AT FAIRLY
LOW LATITUDE...LOCATED ABOUT 200 NM SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST POINT AT
72 HOURS.
 
ALTHOUGH SOME MID-LEVEL MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE HEADING NORTHEASTWARD
AWAY FROM THE CENTER...MOST FACTORS INFLUENCING INTENSITY...AS
INDICATED BY THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST GUIDANCE...POINT TOWARD
STRENGTHENING.
 
A SHIP REPORT OF 10 KT 150 NM TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE SYSTEM AT 18Z
SUGGESTS THAT THE WIND RADII ARE NOT TOO LARGE AS YET...AT LEAST IN
THAT PART OF THE CIRCULATION.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT WED JUL 29 1998

DEEP CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED NEAR THE ESTIMATED CENTER...BUT THERE
ARE NO BANDING FEATURES EVIDENT AT THIS TIME.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 35 KNOTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM THE
TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THAT ALEX IS
MOVING INTO A COL IN THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW...SUGGESTING A WEAK SHEAR
ENVIRONMENT.  SO...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  THIS IS ALSO IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...GUIDANCE.  

ALTHOUGH THE CYCLONE APPEARS TO HAVE A LARGE CIRCULATION ENVELOPE...
CURRENTLY THE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION IS RELATIVELY SMALL.  THUS THE
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII ARE NOT ESTIMATED TO BE VERY LARGE
AT THIS TIME.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THERE IS QUITE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN THE
OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS.  DEEP LAYER STEERING FROM THE
AVIATION MODEL SHOWS A MORE NORTHWESTWARD COURSE DEVELOPING SOON. 
THIS APPEARS TO BE DUE TO MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL VORTICITY BEING DRAWN
SOUTHWESTWARD AHEAD OF ALEX...FROM A TROUGH THAT IS NOW NORTH OF THE
STORM.  HOWEVER THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS ALSO SHOW A STRONG MID-
TROPOSPHERIC HIGH NORTH OF 20N AND WEST OF 50W IN DAY OR TWO.  IF
THE ABOVEMENTIONED VORTICITY FEATURE IS NOT SO PROMINENT...THEN ALEX
MAY BE FORCED ON A MORE WESTWARD TRACK.  INDEED...THIS IS WHAT IS
SUGGESTED BY THE LATEST GFDL GUIDANCE.  FOR NOW...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SHIFTED ONLY SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES THIS MORNING SHOWS THAT THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER OF ALEX IS WEST OF THE LIMITED DEEP CONVECTION...AND THIS

ALEX IS MOVING INTO A COL IN THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW SUGGESTING A
WEAKER SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT ANALYSES
FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES.

THUS...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST WITH THE INTENSIFICATION TREND FROM
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY PRESERVED.    
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 280/17 KNOTS.  THE 12Z TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A BIT LESS SCATTER THAN EARLIER WITH MOST
INDICATING A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE AND A SLOWING IN FORWARD
SPEED BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE PRIMARY QUESTION REGARDING THE
TRACK FORECAST REMAINS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW NEAR
25N55W WHICH WOULD IMPART A MORE NORTHERLY COMPONENT OF MOTION.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS MADE A BIT OF A COMEBACK DURING THE DAY ALTHOUGH
IT IS NOT TERRIBLY WELL-ORGANIZED.  THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT IS
THAT THE CONVECTION IS FORMING CLOSER TO THE CENTER SUGGESTING THAT
ALEX IS MOVING INTO A LIGHTER VERTICAL SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  HOWEVER
...THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF OUTFLOW AND THE DRIER AIR NOTED IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WEST OF ALEX IS NOT CONDUCIVE FOR STRENGTHENING.
OVERALL...THE SYSTEM DOES NOT LOOK VERY HEALTHY AND THE CURRENT
INTENSITY IS HELD AT 35 KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL FORECAST TO
GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN WITH PROGRESSIVELY WARMER SST/S AHEAD AND
IMPROVING UPPER ENVIRONMENT. 

A NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHIC OFFICE DRIFTING BUOY LOCATED ABOUT 100 NM
WEST-NORTHWEST OF THE CENTER REPORTED A 10 METER/6 MINUTE WIND OF 
31 KNOTS AND A PRESSURE OF 1013 MB AT 18Z.  THIS IS CONSISTENT 
WITH OUR CURRENT TROPICAL STORM RADII.
  
THE CENTER HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO LOCATE DURING THE DAY. 
CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE SATELLITE FIXES SUGGEST THE CENTER IS A 
TAD SOUTH AND IS MOVING SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 275/14 KNOTS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A COMPLEX
UPPER AIR PATTERN OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  THE AVIATION MODEL
DEVELOPS A MID-TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
AS A RESULT...THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS SHOW A GENERAL
WESTERLY TRACK THROUGH 36 HOURS...FOLLOWED BY A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST
COURSE.  THE GFDL AND NOGAPS ARE THE SOUTHERN-MOST TRACKS.  WHILE
THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER FEATURES

SATELLITE PICTURES OF ALEX SHOW A LESS COHERENT PATTERN THAN 24
HOURS AGO.  DEEP CONVECTION IS LIMITED AND NOT WELL ORGANIZED AND
THE OVERALL CONFIGURATION...PARTICULARLY AT MID LEVELS...HAS BEEN
ELONGATED FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST BY AN INTERACTION WITH A
COMPLEX CYCLONIC CIRCULATION SEEN NEARBY IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.
THE INITIAL WIND SPEED FOR THIS ADVISORY IS AGAIN 35 KT.
 
ALEX IS MOVING JUST NORTH OF DUE WEST AT ABOUT 13 KT.  WHETHER ALEX
HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE LESSER ANTILLES DEPENDS ON HOW SOON AND
HOW MUCH THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH IS ERODED
WHEN THE LONGWAVE TROUGH ALONG THE EAST COAST IS REINFORCED.
YESTERDAY...THE 12Z NOGAPS SEEMED TO PROVIDE THE BEST GUIDANCE...
KEEPING A STRONGER HIGH TO THE NORTH AND A MORE WESTERLY TRACK THAN
SHOWN BY THE OTHER MODELS.  THERE IS A SIMILAR DIFFERENCE TODAY WITH
THE NEW 18Z AVN NOW ALSO SHOWING A PROLONGED WESTWARD HEADING...
THROUGH 36-48 HOURS.  IN DEFERENCE TO YESTERDAYS PARTIAL
VERIFICATION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
CLUSTER OF 12Z AVN-BASED TRACKS...BUT NOT AS FAR SOUTH AS THE
NOGAPS.
  
INTENSIFICATION IS STILL POSSIBLE AND THE GFDL AND SHIPS SCHEMES
BRING ALEX TO THE THRESHOLD OF HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 72 HOURS.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST ALSO SHOWS STRENGTHENING...BUT THIS IS POSTPONED
ABOUT A DAY...UNTIL THE PERIOD WHEN THE AVN SHOWS A SOMEWHAT MORE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

THE STORM CONTINUES TO LOOK LESS-ORGANIZED THAN IT DID 24 HOURS
AGO...AND MAXIMUM WIND ESTIMATE IS UNCHANGED FOR THIS ADVISORY. 
INFRARED IMAGERY SHOWS SOUTHERLY SHEARING OVER ALEX...ALTHOUGH WATER
VAPOR ANIMATION SUGGESTS FAIRLY WEAK SHEAR JUST AHEAD.  SINCE THE
SYSTEM HAS FAILED TO STRENGTHEN SIGNIFICANTLY THUS FAR...NO CHANGE
IS FORECAST FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS WITH ONLY A MODEST INCREASE
THEREAFTER.  THE SHIPS MODEL GIVES A SIMILAR INTENSITY FORECAST.

MOTION CONTINUES SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WEST AROUND 13 KT.  ACCORDING TO
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...A MID/UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE/VORTMAX IS
PREDICTED TO BE BETWEEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND ALEX IN 2-3 DAYS. 
THIS FEATURE...IF IT VERIFIES...WOULD INDUCE A MORE NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE LATEST NOGAPS RUN PAINTS A
SIMILAR PICTURE.  HOWEVER...THE 00Z GFDL MODEL RUN SHOWS A MORE
SOUTHERN TRACK.  IN DEFERENCE TO THE LATTER MODEL...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST ONLY BENDS THE TRACK TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST DURING THE
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS NHC
FORECAST.

11 AM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

THERE IS AN AREA OF CONCENTRATED CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND
CONSEQUENTLY THE DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE 3.0 FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.
THEREFORE...THE WINDS ARE ADJUSTED TO 45 KNOTS.  THE OUTFLOW IS
PARTIALLY RESTRICTED BUT IS ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM. THERE ARE
HOSTILE UPPER LEVEL WINDS AHEAD OF THE STORM...HOWEVER ...GLOBAL
MODELS SUGGEST THAT THESE WESTERLIES WILL WEAKEN OR RETROGRADE AND
THEN SOME SOUTHERLY SHEAR MAY DEVELOP. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS
FOR SOME STRENGTHENING SINCE THE GFDL AND SHIPS MODELS BRING THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE TO 65 TO 65 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.  ON THE LONGER
RANGE...4-5 DAYS... THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS BECOME A LITTLE MORE
FAVORABLE IN THE AREA BETWEEN PUERTO RICO AND BERMUDA.

ALEX IS CURRENTLY MOVING AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A WELL ESTABLISHED
DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE AT ABOUT 280/13.  THIS RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
HAVE A WEAKNESS ALONG 60-65 WEST. THIS WOULD INDUCE A TRACK MORE TO
THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
ON THIS TRACK...ALEX WOULD SKIRT THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS BUT
THEY STILL NEED TO MONITOR THIS STORM. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY
CLOSE TO THE GFDL BUT TO THE SOUTH OF MOST OF THE OTHER GUIDANCE.  

THE HIGH ALTITUDE NOOA JET IS SCHEDULED TO SAMPLE THE ENVIRONMENT
SURROUNDING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE LATE FRIDAY.

5 PM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

ALEX HAS MAINTAINED ITS DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER DURING THE
PAST SEVERAL HOURS WHILE THE OUTFLOW IS BECOMING A LITTLE BETTER
ORGANIZED.  HOWEVER...T-NUMBERS REMAIN ABOUT 3.0 SO THE WINDS ARE
KEPT AT 45 KNOTS AT THIS TIME. ALEX IS DEFINITIVELY BETTER ORGANIZED
THAN YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME. A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AHEAD OF THE STORM BUT IT WILL BE WEAK ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME
SLOW STRENGTHENING OF THE STORM.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS ALEX
TO A 65-KNOT HURRICANE BY 48 HOURS AS SUGGESTED BY THE GFDL AND
SHIPS MODELS.  ON THE LONGER RANGE...4-5 DAYS... THE UPPER LEVEL
WINDS BECOME A LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE IN THE AREA BETWEEN PUERTO RICO
AND BERMUDA.

MOST OF THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE SAME SCENARIO. A WELL
ESTABLISHED DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE WHICH IS FORECAST TO HAVE A
WEAKNESS ALONG 60-65 WEST.  THIS PATTERN WOULD INDUCE A TRACK MORE
TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  ON THIS TRACK...THE CORE OF ALEX WOULD SKIRT THE NORTHERN
LEEWARD ISLANDS AS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH IN FACT
IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL.

LONG RANGE MODELS ARE DEVELOPING A LARGE TROUGH ALONG EAST COAST OF
THE UNITED STATES.  IF THIS VERFIES...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL TAKE
A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC.

11 PM EDT THU JUL 30 1998
 
ALEX IS GENERATING A CENTRAL AREA OF INTENSE CONVECTION WITH A
FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL HIGH-LEVEL OUTFLOW.  AT AN INTERMEDIATE
LEVEL...HOWEVER...THERE REMAINS A DISTINCT SSW CURRENT ACROSS THE
STORM ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AHEAD OF THE STORM.  THIS IS
JUST ONE PART OF A COMPLICATED CIRCULATION ALOFT THAT INCLUDES A
WELL-DEFINED VORTEX SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO
THE NORTHWEST OF ALEX.  THE AVN MODEL SHOWS THAT VORTEX AT 300-500
MB.  

THE INTENSE OUTFLOW AT CIRRUS LEVEL HAS OBSCURED THE CENTRAL
FEATURES...MAKING POSITIONING SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULT.  ANALYSES
FROM TAFB...SAB..AND AFWA...HOWEVER...INDICATE THAT A HEADING TOWARD
THE WNW HAS BEGUN...PERHAPS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOW DEEP ENOUGH TO
RESPOND MORE TO THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW IN ITS ENVIRONMENT.  THE MOTION
IS ESTIMATED AT 290/11 KT.  WIND SPEED IS NEAR 45 KT.
 
THE PATTERN ALOFT IS FORECAST TO REMAIN COMPLEX...WITH THE AVN
KEEPING A VORTEX TO THE NW-N OF ALEX THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS
IS INTERPRETED AS A GENERAL WEAKNESS IN THE HEIGHT PATTERN THAT
SHOULD ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN THE NORTHWARD COMPONENT.  THE
RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE FEATURES WILL PROBABLY INFLUENCE HOW
SMOOTH THE TRANSITION IN TRACK WILL BE.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS
LITTLE DIVERSITY.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NEAR THE CENTER OF THE
CLUSTER OF MODEL TRACKS AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE 18 AVN AND 12Z
NOGAPS FORECASTS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS 6 HOURS AGO.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON INFRARED IMAGERY AS A LARGE
CDO TYPE FEATURE IS OBSCURING THE LOWER CLOUDS.  TAFB AND SAB ARE
OVER 60 NMI APART IN THEIR 0545Z POSITION ESTIMATES.  THE OFFICIAL
INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION...290/11...MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE POSITION IS NEAR THE SOUTHWEST EDGE OF THE
DEEP CONVECTION SUGGESTING SOME SOUTHERLY VERTICAL SHEAR.  IF THE
CENTER IS ACTUALLY EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION...ALEX COULD
BE STRONGER THAN WE ARE ESTIMATING AND ALSO MOVING WITH MORE OF A
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.

THE TRACK MODELS ARE ALL CLOSELY CLUSTERED AND SHOW A MOSTLY
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS...MOVING INTO A WEAKNESS
IN THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE AND IS SIMILAR AND AN UPDATE TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.

THE INITIAL AND FORECAST INTENSITY ARE THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS

RELOCATED TO THE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS POSITION.  GLOBAL MODELS ARE

PERSIST FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME...AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RELAX
UNTIL 72 HOURS.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS 45 KNOTS AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR NO CHANGE AT THIS TIME. MOREOVER... WEAKENING MAY
BE INDICATED IN THE NEXT ADVISORY IF THIS TREND CONTINUES.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 270/10.  THE STEERING PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED AND
IF ALEX SURVIVES...IT IS EXPECTED TO TURN MORE TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST AS INDICATED BY MOST OF THE MODELS.  IF ALEX
BECOMES COMPLETELY EXPOSED AND WEAKENS FURTHER... THE SYSTEM COULD
MOVE MORE TO THE WEST.  HOWEVER...UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES HAVE BECOME

YESTERDAY...WE FORECAST THAT ALEX WAS GOING TO REACH HURRICANE
STATUS IN ABOUT 48 HOURS.  INSTEAD...STRONG SOUTHERLY UPPER-LEVEL
WINDS HIT THE STORM REMOVING MOST OF THE CONVECTION FROM THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER AND CONSEQUENTLY...WEAKENING HAS OCCURRED.  THIS
WEAKENING WAS NOT INDICATED BY ANY OF THE AVAILABLE TOOLS AND
REFLECTS HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT FORECASTING INTENSITY CHANGES.
AFTER THE FACT....IT IS SOMETIMES EASY TO FIND AN EXPLANATION.

IT APPEARS THAT THE WIND SHEAR WILL PERSIST SO WEAKENING SHOULD
CONTINUE AND ALEX COULD BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION
TONIGHT OR SATURDAY.   INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 35
KNOTS AND WINDS ARE KEPT AT 30 KNOTS THROUGH 72 HOURS.  

NOW THAT WE CAN SEE THE LOW LEVEL CENTER...WE HAVE A BETTER ESTIMATE
OF THE INITIAL MOTION WHICH IS 280/10.  A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED OF WHATEVER IS LEFT OF ALEX.
HOWEVER...IF IT BECOMES AN OPEN WAVE THE SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY
PROPAGATE WESTWARD SPREADING SHOWERS AND SQUALLS.

ALEX IS STILL GENERATING A FEW CLUSTERS OF DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE
NORTHERN PART OF ITS CIRCULATION AND...AS SUGGESTED BY DVORAK
TECHNIQUE ANALYSES...THE SYSTEM IS PROBABLY STILL A TROPICAL STORM.
ESTIMATED WINDS ARE 35 KT.  DATA FROM THE NOAA HIGH-ALTITUDE JET
SEEMS TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL SHEARING
PATTERN MAINLY BELOW ALEX/S CIRRUS CANOPY LEVEL.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/11 KT.  TRACK FORECASTING BECOMES MORE
DIFFICULT THAN USUAL WHEN...LIKE NOW...IT IS ALSO TIED TO A HIGHLY
UNCERTAIN INTENSITY FORECAST.  THERE APPEAR TO BE THREE PRIMARY
POSSIBILITIES.  FIRST...IF THE SHEAR SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTEDLY DECREASES
THEN ALEX COULD STRENGTHEN AND TURN MORE TOWARD THE WNW OR NW...
DIMINISHING ANY THREAT TO THE CARIBBEAN.  SECOND...ALEX COULD WEAKEN
FURTHER OR DISSIPATE WITH ITS REMNANTS MOVING NEARLY WESTWARD...
AGAIN HAVING MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE CARIBBEAN.  THIRD...THE SYSTEM
COULD REMAIN MUCH AS IT IS...UNIMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE PICTURES...
BUT A POTENTIAL PRODUCER OF SOME HEAVY RAIN AND THE POSSIBILITY OF
LOCAL FLOODING AND HIGH WIND GUSTS FOR THE LEEWARD ISLANDS HAVING
HIGH TERRAIN.
 
WITH SHEAR EXPECTED TO PERSIST...THE SECOND SCENARIO MIGHT BE THE
MOST LIKELY.  HOWEVER...PARTLY TO BE CAUTIONS...THE CURRENT FORECAST
HAS A LITTLE MORE OF AN INKLING OF THE THIRD POSSIBILITY THAN WE
HAVE INDICATED PREVIOUSLY.  THE TRACK IS SHIFTED TO THE LEFT A
LITTLE AND IF THIS TREND IS OBSERVED OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS
...SOME CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO ISSUING A TROPICAL
STORM WATCH OR WARNING FOR A PORTION OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS ON
SATURDAY.  THE NHC TRACK IS BETWEEN BAMS AND CLIPER...WHICH FORM THE

MAINTAINED AS A MINIMUM TROPICAL STORM...35 KNOTS... FOR THIS

IN ITS WEAKEN STATE ALEX/S MOTION IS BEING CONTROLLED BY LOW-LEVEL
TROPOSPHERIC STEERING...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 275/12
KNOTS.  AS STATED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY THE TRACK AND INTENSITY
FORECASTS FOR ALEX ARE INTERTWINED. DATA FROM THE G-IV HIGH-ALTITUDE
JET AIRCRAFT MISSION FRIDAY AFTERNOON REVEALED 30-40 KNOT SOUTH/
SOUTHWEST WINDS BETWEEN 200 AND 250 MB IN THE VICINITY OF THE
SYSTEM.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW ABOUT
11 DEG NW OF ALEX HELPING TO BACK THE FLOW OVER THE EASTERN
CARIBBEAN.  SO...THE SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST.  IF THE SHEAR DID RELAX ALEX COULD STRENGTHEN
AND TURN MORE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST... AND MOST OF THE TRACK
MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS THIS SCENARIO.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A LESS
PLAUSIBLE POSSIBILITY.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING THROUGH
24 HOURS WITH A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST THEN NORTHWEST TRACK THEREAFTER.

THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS IN CLOSE
AGREEMENT WITH BAM SHALLOW.  WITH THE VERTICAL WIND SHEAR EXPECTED

STORM FORCE WINDS WERE OBSERVED BY THE FLIGHT CREW...BUT ONLY IN THE
THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS NORTH OF THE NOW ALMOST ENTIRELY EXPOSED
LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  THE SUSTAINED WINDS ARE LIKELY NOW AT MOST 45 KT. 
INITIAL MOTION IS NEAR 300/13 KT.
 
THE FUTURE TRACK AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALEX ARE COMPLICATED BY A
FRACTURED CIRCULATION PATTERN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WITH
ANOTHER LOW-LEVEL VORTEX TO THE WNW OF ALEX AND WITH SOME MODELS
INDICATING THAT YET ANOTHER LOW WILL DEVELOP FROM THE BAROCLINIC
ZONE ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST.  ALOFT...A LARGE AND PERSISTENT
CYCLONIC CIRCULATION IS NOTED.  REMARKABLY...THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS
RELATIVELY UNIFORM...SUGGESTING A WNW TO NW TRACK THROUGH 48 HOURS. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THOSE TRACKS AND
SIMILAR TO THE GFDL.
  
ALEX/S INTENSITY WILL BE PARTLY A FUNCTION OF HOW IT NEGOTIATES A
TRACK AROUND...OR THROUGH...THE UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATION. 
WITHOUT HAVING A GOOD HANDLE ON HOW THAT INTERACTION WILL PLAY
OUT...THE CURRENT FORECAST WILL SHOW NO CHANGE IN WIND SPEED.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
STORM.  ALEX REMAINS IN A SHEARED STATE WITH THE CENTER LOCATED TO
THE SOUTH OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN
UPPER LEVEL LOW NEAR 25N64W WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SOUTH-
SOUTHWESTERLY SHEARING.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THE
SYSTEM HAS DROPPED BELOW STORM STRENGTH...BUT WE WILL WAIT FOR THE
AIR FORCE RECON LATER TODAY TO CONFIRM THIS.  SINCE THERE IS STILL A
SLIM POSSIBILITY THAT UPPER-LEVEL CONDITIONS COULD BECOME LESS
HOSTILE FOR STRENGTHENING...AS INDICATED BY MODELS SUCH AS THE
STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS THE WINDS AT 35 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

ALEX HAS TURNED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT AND IS NOW MOVING AT AN
ESTIMATED 310/11.  THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST IS TO THE RIGHT OF
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND NEAR THE CONSENSUS OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACKS. 
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB LOW NEAR THE SOUTH CAROLINA
COAST WITH A HIGH CENTERED JUST EAST OF BERMUDA IN 2-3 DAYS.  THIS
SUPPORTS A CONTINUED NORTHWESTWARD...PERHAPS MORE NORTH-
NORTHWESTWARD... MOVEMENT OF ALEX.

THE STRONG TROPICAL WAVE TO THE EAST OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS HAS
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY...AS THE CLOUD PATTERN BECAME MORE
CONSOLIDATED OVER THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE SYSTEM.  LOW CLOUD
MOTIONS AND SHIP REPORTS SHOW A CLOSED SURFACE CIRCULATION WHICH IS
SOMEWHAT ELONGATED ALONG A NORTHWEST-SOUTHEAST AXIS.   UPPER-LEVEL
WINDS...SUCH AS THOSE ANALYZED BY THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES ON THE INTERNET...APPEAR MOSTLY
FAVORABLE OVER THE AREA...ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION OF
SLIGHT SOUTHERLY SHEAR OVER THE DEPRESSION.  THE STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...INDICATES STEADY
STRENGTHENING...BUT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT MORE
CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE OF THE CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN INTENSITY
FORECASTING. 

THE CURRENT POSITION...WHICH SUGGESTS A MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION
COMPARED TO THE EARLIER CENTER FIXES...PARTIALLY REPRESENTS A
REFORMATION OF THE CENTER AS THE CYCLONE ORGANIZES.  OUR BEST
INITIAL MOVEMENT ESTIMATE IS 295/17 AND OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE IS IN
REASONABLE AGREEMENT ON A CONTINUATION OF THIS MOTION FOR THE NEXT
FEW DAYS.  THIS LOOKS REASONABLE SINCE THE NUMERICAL MODELS ALSO
SHOW A MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.

LAST LIGHT VISIBLE PICTURES SUGGESTED THAT THE CENTER REMAINS BROAD

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER POSITION IS JUST SOUTHEAST OF A CURRENT BURST
OF DEEP CONVECTION.  THE CENTER MAY BE TRYING TO RE-DEVELOP CLOSER

AGREEMENT...ALTHOUGH THE USUAL UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH INFRARED

GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS
BEEN ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND

DEEP CONVECTION IS GRADUALLY BECOMING MORE CONCENTRATED NEAR THE
ESTIMATED CIRCULATION CENTER AND DIMINISHING ALONG THE PREVIOUSLY
NOTED AXIS EXTENDING TOWARD THE SE.  WHILE THIS IMPLIES AN IMPROVING
ORGANIZATION...DVORAK T-NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN AT
2.0...JUST BELOW TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR IS
OFTEN THE NEMESIS OF ATLANTIC TROPICAL CYCLONES.  IN THIS CASE...THE
SYSTEM HAS A REMARKABLY PROMINENT OUTFLOW ALOFT WITH...IF ANYTHING
...SOUTHEASTERLY SHEAR.  THE FORECAST ENVIRONMENT AHEAD IS FAVORABLE
FOR STRENGTHENING AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE NHC FORECAST WHICH
SHOWS AN INTENSIFICATION RATE APPROXIMATING THAT OF THE SHIP/S
SCHEME.
 
THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH IS EXPECTED TO KEEP THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE ON A WNW HEADING FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS WITH THE STRONG
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH NOW ALONG THE EAST COAST SWINGING OFFSHORE AND
LIKELY BYPASSING THE SYSTEM.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE AND OFFICIAL
FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY ARE BASED ON THIS SEQUENCE.
 
BEGINNING AROUND 48 HOURS...THE LARGE-SCALE MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE
MARKEDLY.  WHEN A SECOND SHORT-WAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE
COAST...THE 00Z AVN AND NOGAPS TURN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE NORTHWARD
AROUND THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE HIGH...BETWEEN 66-70W.  THIS IS
SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS RUNS FROM THOSE MODELS.  THE GFDL...ON THE OTHER
HAND...MAINTAINS A MID-LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDING WESTWARD FROM THE HIGH
TO THE GULF OF MEXICO BETWEEN 25-30N.  THIS KEEPS THE SYSTEM ON A
WNW TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS...ENDING UP SOME 500 NM SOUTHWEST OF THE
OTHER GUIDANCE.  THIS GFDL TRACK IS A LITTLE NORTH OF ITS TRACK 6
HOURS AGO.  THE NHC TRACK IS NORTH OF THE GFDL...ON THE SOUTHERN
EDGE OF THE REMAINING GUIDANCE...AND CLOSE TO OUR PREVIOUS TRACKS.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE DEPRESSION IS FAIRLY WELL
ORGANIZED...AND MAY BE A TROPICAL STORM.  WE WILL AWAIT THE AIR
FORCE RECON OBSERVATIONS LATER TODAY TO SEE IF WE SHOULD NAME THE
SYSTEM.  THE ANTICYLONIC OUTFLOW IS VERY IMPRESSIVE OVER THE
NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE AND RAWINSONDE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE
NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN SHOW NO HIGH LEVEL WESTERLIES TO IMPEDE
DEVELOPMENT.  SO...STRENGTHENING IS PREDICTED AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.
 
THE CYCLONE WAS APPARENTLY MOVING FASTER OVERNIGHT THAN EARLIER
REPORTED AND HAS BEEN RELOCATED FARTHER TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST.
MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 290/20.  THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A BROAD
TROUGH AT 500 MB MOVING OFF THE NORTHEAST U.S. COAST IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS AND THIS SHOULD PARTIALLY BREAK DOWN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OVER
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  CONSEQUENTLY MOST OF THE TRACK PREDICTION
MODELS TURN THE CYCLONE TO THE NORTHWEST AND SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED
LATER IN THE PERIOD...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  HOWEVER WE ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORE WESTWARD TRACK SINCE THE
STATE-OF-THE-ART  GFDL MODEL DOES NOT SHOW MUCH OF A NORTHWARD
TREND.
 
THE NOAA G-4 JET AND BOTH NOAA P-3 PLANES WILL FLY A SYNOPTIC

THE HURRICANE HUNTERS FOUND FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS TO 61 KNOTS TO THE

UPGRADING T.D. TWO TO TROPICAL STORM BONNIE. ALTHOUGH THE STORM HAS
A WELL-ORGANIZED APPEARANCE IN SATELLITE IMAGERY...ITS RAPID FORWARD
TRANSLATIONAL SPEED IS APPARENTLY DISTORTING THE WIND FIELD NEAR THE
CENTER.  THE ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT REMAINS FAVORABLE FOR CONTINUED
STRENGTHENING AND INTENSIFICATION IS EVEN MORE LIKELY IF THE FORWARD
SPEED SLOWS SOMEWHAT...AS FORECAST.
 
BONNIE HAS BEEN TRACKING SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST TODAY...BUT
PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS EXCEPT THE GFDL SHOW
A SIGNIFICANT TURN TO THE RIGHT.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH A
BREAKDOWN OF THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AS
SHOWN BY THE GLOBAL MODELS.  NOTWITHSTANDING...OUT OF RESPECT FOR
WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE OUR MOST RELIABLE GUIDANCE...THE GFDL...WE
ARE KEEPING THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE
ENSEMBLE.
 
SINCE THE FORECAST TRACK IS RATHER CLOSE TO THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND
PUERTO RICO...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS AND WATCHES HAVE BEEN ISSUED
FOR THESE AREAS.  HOWEVER AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT THE STRONG
WINDS ARE RESTRICTED MAINLY TO THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE OF BONNIE.

WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE RECON IN THE AREA UNTIL OOZ TONIGHT.
EARLIER FIXES INDICATE THAT BONNIE HAS BEEN MOVING ABOUT 290/15.
MINIMUM PRESSURE IS ESTIMATED AT 999 MB.  SATELLITE SUGGESTS THAT
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED WITH
DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND EXCELLENT OUTFLOW. BOTH SHIPS
AND THE GFDL SUGGEST THAT BONNIE COULD REACH 100 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS
AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.
 
THE BIG DILEMMA IS WHETHER OR NOT THE TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO
DEVELOP ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL
STEER BONNIE NORTHWARD.  IN ANY CASE THE STEERING FLOW IS FORECAST
TO WEAKEN WHICH WOULD SLOW BONNIE DOWN. NOGAPS BRINGS BONNIE CLOSER
TO THE COAST THAN IN PREVIOUS RUNS IN THE MEDIUM RANGE AND THE
LATEST GFDL MAINTAINS A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...AS IN PREVIOUS FORECAST...CONTINUES VERY CLOSE TO THE

BONNIE CONTINUES TO LOOK STRONGER ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...WITH A VERY
COLD TOPPED CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST AND INCREASED BANDING FEATURES
OVER THE NORTH AND WEST QUADRANTS.  RECON RECENTLY FOUND A 991 MB
CENTRAL PRESSURE AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 60 KNOTS.
THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW STILL LOOKS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  BONNIE COULD BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE
WITHIN THIS FORECAST PERIOD.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/15.  THE DYNAMICAL MODELS INDICATE
THAT THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF BONNIE WILL BREAK DOWN
LATER IN THIS FORECAST PERIOD WHICH SHOULD SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED
AND EVENTUALLY RESULT IN A MORE NORTHWARD TRACK.  THE TIMING OF THIS
NORTHWARD MOTION...OF COURSE...IS CRITICAL.  OUR CURRENT TRACK LEANS
TOWARD THE LEFT OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE AND IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH
THE GFDL.  IT IS NOTED THAT THE UKMET...NAVY NOGAPS...AND AVN ARE
CONSISTENTLY TO THE RIGHT OF OUR TRACK.
 
BONNIE COULD STILL BE A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE EAST U.S. COAST
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  WE ARE INSERTING A STATEMENT TO THE
EFFECT ...RESIDENTS WITHIN THIS AREA SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
BONNIE AT THIS TIME.
 
THE NOAA HIGH ALTITUDE JET AND BOTH NOAA P3 AIRCRAFT ARE FLYING A

ON THEIR LAST PASS THROUGH BONNIE NEAR 0530Z...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS
FOUND THAT A NEARLY COMPLETE EYEWALL HAD FORMED.  THEY ALSO REPORTED
A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 987 MB WITH FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 76 KT.
SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT 65 KT.  THE
MOTION HAS EDGED OVER TO 300 DEGREES...STILL AT 15 KNOTS.
 
NOAA AIRCRAFT HAVE ONCE AGAIN PROVIDED THE NUMERICAL MODELS NUMEROUS
VERTICAL SOUNDINGS OF BONNIE/S ENVIRONMENT TO IMPROVE FORECASTS OF
TRACK AND INTENSITY.  THE RESULTING GUIDANCE AND OUR CONCERNS ARE
LITTLE CHANGED.  THE LARGE-SCALE MODELS SHOW A WEAKENING OF STEERING
CURRENTS DURING THE NEXT TWO DAYS...FOLLOWED BY THE APPROACH OF A
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES WHICH COULD INDUCE A GREATER
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS SIMILAR TO 6
HOURS AGO SHOWING A GRADUAL TURN FROM WNW TO NW AND DECELERATION
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  THE GFDL TRACK AGAIN FORMS THE LEFT EDGE OF
THE ENSEMBLE...BUT ALL THE GFDL 72-HOUR FORECAST POSITIONS FOR
BONNIE HAVE ENDED UP LEFT OF THE ACTUAL TRACK.  THE NHC FORECAST IS
TO THE RIGHT OF GFDL...NEAR LBAR WHICH HAS HAD LITTLE LATERAL
BIAS...AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS TRACK.
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BAHAMAS HAS ISSUED A HURRICANE WARNING FOR THE

FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT BONNIE
IS RIGHT ON TRACK...300/14.  THERE IS NO APPARENT CHANGE IN THE BOTH
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING BONNIE.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE LOCATED
TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE HURRICANE WILL DRIVE THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE THAT THE RIDGE WILL WEAKEN...
ALLOWING BONNIE TO TURN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH. THE GFDL
MAKES A MORE GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST WITH A DECREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONTINUES VERY CLOSE TO THE
GFDL BUT REFLECTING THE CONSENSUS FOR A MORE NORTHWARD TURN BEYOND
36 HOURS.
 
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DROPPED TO 980 MB SUGGESTING THAT
STRENGTHENING IS OCCURRING. SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD

ALL CURRENT AVAILABLE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT BONNIE SHOULD TURN MORE
TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.
THIS TURN IS ALSO FORECAST BY OUR STATE OF THE ART GFDL MODEL. THIS
LESSENS ANY POSSIBLE THREAT OF LANDFALL IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA.
HOWEVER...ONE SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
BONNIE UNTIL THE EXPECTED TURN MATERIALIZES.  ON THE OTHER
HAND...THE POTENTIAL THREAT FROM CENTRAL FLORIDA NORTHWARD ALONG THE
EAST COAST REMAINS. 

BONNIE HAS SLOWED DOWN...AS FORECAST BY THE GFDL...AND THE INITIAL
MOTION IS 300/11.  THERE IS ENOUGH RIDGING TO THE NORTH TO MAINTAIN
THIS GENERAL TRACK THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A SLOW
TURN TO THE NORTHWEST IS FORECAST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AGAIN
VERY CLOSE TO THE GFDL AND BIT TO THE LEFT OF THE OTHER MODELS. 

NOTE: LATEST NOGAPS KEEPS THE HURRICANE ON A GENERAL NORTHWEST TO
NORTH-NORTHWEST TRACK AND BRINGS THE CENTER OF BONNIE NEAR THE SOUTH
CAROLINA COAST BY EARLY WEDNESDAY. THIS IS ALSO INDICATED BY THE
MEDIUM RANGE VERSION OF THE GFDL.  

LATEST RECON DATA SHOWS THAT THE WINDS ARE 80 KNOTS AND MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE REMAINS AT 977 MB. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAKES
BONNIE A CATEGORY 3 ON THE SAFFIR SIMPSON-SCALE AS INDICATED IN THE

THE LAST AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 959 MB...A 3 MB DECREASE SINCE 03Z AND AN 18 MB FALL IN
THE LAST 10 HOURS...AND A 25 NMI CIRCULAR EYE.  THE FLIGHT-LEVEL
WINDS HAVE NOW INCREASED WITH A MAXIMUM WIND OF 102 KNOTS RECORDED
IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 
90 KNOTS.  THE SATELLITE PRESENTATION REMAINS IMPRESSIVE WITH A
SYMMETRIC RING OF -75C TOPS SURROUNDING THE EYE AND EXCELLENT
OUTFLOW.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR FURTHER STRENGTHENING
ALONG THE LINES OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

RECONNAISSANCE POSITION FIXES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS INDICATE
THAT THE MOTION OF BONNIE HAS BEEN SLOW AND ERRATIC.  THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE BASED ON THE LAST 6 HOURS IS 310/06 KNOTS.  AS HAS
BEEN THE CASE IN THE LAST SEVERAL ADVISORIES...THE FUTURE TRACK OF
BONNIE IS HINGED ON THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RIDGE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM. 
THE SYSTEM SHOULD TURN MORE TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST AND NORTH DURING
THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS...STEERED...IN PART...AROUND THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE TO THE EAST.  A TROUGH
CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL U.S. IS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE
NORTHEAST U.S. IN THE NEXT 36 TO 48 HOURS WHICH MAY HELP TURN BONNIE
MORE NORTHWARD.  THE AVIATION SHOWS THIS TROUGH MOVING FAR ENOUGH
SOUTH TO PULL BONNIE NORTH WHILE THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL INDICATES
THAT THE TROUGH STAYS SUFFICIENTLY NORTH TO ALLOW A MORE NORTHWEST
MOTION.  

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
AND IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL...AND SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE
UKMET.   NOGAPS MODEL IS THE LEFT-MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.   ALTHOUGH
THIS TRACK LESSENS THE THREAT OF LANDFALL IN FLORIDA...INTERESTS IN

11 AM EDT SUN AUG 23 1998

EVEN THOUGH THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW TO THE WEST IS CURRENTLY BEING
IMPEDED A BIT...BONNIE HAS CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN.  A HURRICANE
HUNTER PLANE IS FINDING WINDS OF AT LEAST 100 KNOTS AT THE 700 MB
LEVEL...AND WINDS AT 850 MB ARE PROBABLY HIGHER.  ON SATELLITE...
BONNIE HAS A CLASSICAL APPEARENCE.  THE COLD-TOPPED DENSE OVERCAST
SURROUNDING THE EYE HAS GROWN IN SIZE.  CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE
IS 100 KNOTS...MAKING BONNIE A MAJOR HURRICANE.  SOME FURTHER
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR.  

RECON AND SATELLITE FIXES YIELD LITTLE MOTION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
HOURS...SO THE GUIDANCE MODELS WERE INITIALIZED WITH A FORWARD
MOTION OF ZERO.  THE RESULTING OBJECTIVE TRACK FORECASTS ARE HIGHLY
DIVERGENT...WITH 72 HOUR PREDICTIONS RANGING FROM NEAR THE CAROLINA
COAST TO WELL OFFSHORE OF THE U.S. EAST COAST.  THE STEERING PATTERN
IS BY NO MEANS STRAIGHTFORWARD.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THAT A
WEAK MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS CURRENTLY IN THE VICINITY OF
BONNIE... AND HAS PROBABLY CAUSED THE STALLING OF THE HURRICANE.  IT
APPEARS THAT THIS TROUGH WILL BYPASS BONNIE...THEREFORE A SLOW
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION IS FORECAST TO RESUME.   WATER VAPOR WINDS FROM
THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS SUGGESTS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE
EXTENDING EASTWARD FROM NEAR THE FLORIDA-GEORGIA BORDER INTO THE
ATLANTIC FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES...AND THIS COULD PREVENT A TURN
AWAY FROM THE COAST IF IT PERSISTS.  THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER
ANOTHER UPSTREAM TROUGH...CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTH-CENTRAL U.S.
...WILL EVENTUALLY PULL BONNIE AWAY FROM THE COAST.  ALL INTERESTS
ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. SHOULD MAINTAIN THEIR VIGILANCE AND
MONITOR FUTURE ADVISORIES. 

ANOTHER MULTI-AIRCRAFT MISSION INVOLVING AIRCRAFT FROM BOTH NOAA AND
NASA WILL PROVIDE EXTENSIVE SAMPLING OF THE STEERING ENVIRONMENT
TODAY.  THEIR DATA SHOULD HELP IMPROVE THE INITIALIZATION AND BRING

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SUN AUG 23 1998

AFTER DRIFTING TO THE NORTH EARLIER TODAY...BONNIE APPEARS TO NOW BE
MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWESTWARD.  THE INFLUENCE OF THE MID- TO UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH...THAT LIKELY INDUCED THE NORTHWARD NUDGE OF THE
HURRICANE...NOW APPEARS TO BE LESSENING AS IT BY PASSES BONNIE.  WE
ARE NOW FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF THE FUTURE COURSE OF THIS
HURRICANE.  THE PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT SOME OF OUR
BEST TRACK PREDICTION MODELS HAVE SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE LEFT
AS COMPARED TO THIS MORNING.  LOOKING AT SOME OF THE MODEL
FIELDS...THERE IS NOW A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT BONNIE COULD BE
TRAPPED BENEATH A NARROW RIDGE ALONG ABOUT 36N LATITUDE OR SO.  IF
THIS IS THE CASE...BONNIE COULD REACH THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST NEAR
THE END OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.

THE EYE HAS BECOME INDISTINCT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.  SINCE BONNIE
HAS BEEN DWELLING OVER THE SAME GENERAL AREA MOST OF TODAY...IT MAY
HAVE COOLED THE SURFACE WATERS UNDERNEATH IT AND THIS MAY HAVE
TEMPORARILY BRAKED THE STRENGTHENING TREND.  ANOTHER INHIBITING
FACTOR MAY HAVE THE ABOVEMENTIONED TROUGH.  HOWEVER THE HURRICANE
HAS A MASSIVE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW OVER ALL BUT THE
NORTHWEST QUADRANT.  ALSO...THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DIURNAL
FLUCTUATIONS WHEREIN THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN STRENGTHENING MORE DURING
THE NIGHTTIME HOURS THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...AND BECOMING A LITTLE
LESS ORGANIZED AROUND MIDDAY.  SOME FURTHER INCREASE IN INTENSITY IS
CERTAINLY POSSIBLE DURING THE PERIOD.

ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. SHOULD MAINTAIN THEIR
VIGILANCE AND MONITOR FUTURE ADVISORIES.  WE HAVE INSERTED A
STATEMENT INTO THE ADVISORY THAT A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE REQUIRED
FOR A PORTION OF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST ON MONDAY
 
ANOTHER MULTI-AIRCRAFT MISSION INVOLVING AIRCRAFT FROM BOTH NOAA AND

AIR FORCE RESERVE AIRCRAFT FIXES SHOW THAT THE MOTION IS STILL SLOW
AND ERRATIC.  THE PAST 12 HOUR MOTION IS 320/04 AND THIS WILL BE
USED AS THE INITIAL MOTION.
 
THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS FASCINATING.  THE GFDL MODEL HAS CHANGED
DRAMATICALLY FROM THE PREVIOUS RUN.  INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SOUTH
CAROLINA IN 72 HOURS...THE LATEST RUN...BASED ON EXCELLENT DATA FROM
A MULTI AIRCRAFT MISSION TO INITIALIZE THE 00Z ANALYSIS...SHOWS
THE NARROW RIDGE TO THE NORTH BREAKING DOWN AND BONNIE ACCELERATING
NORTH NORTHWESTWARD AND THEN RECURVING NORTHEASTWARD AND STAYING
OFFSHORE OF THE OUTER BANKS BY 100 MILES.  IN CONTRAST THE NOGAPS
AND UKMET MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A SLOW NORTHWEST MOTION TOWARD
GEORGIA OR SOUTH CAROLINA.  MY FORECAST TRACK IS A COMPROMISE WHICH
PUTS THE CENTER ON THE SOUTHERN COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA IN 72 HOURS.
THIS IS A STRATEGY OF LEAST REGRET...SO THAT INTERESTS ALONG THE

REPORTED USING GPS SONDS DURING THE LATEST MISSION WAS 94 KNOTS IN

HURRICANE BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  20
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON AUG 24 1998

LATEST RECON FIX SHOWS LITTLE MOVEMENT...AGAIN.  WE STILL EXPECT A
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION TO RESUME BUT THE STEERING CURRENTS ARE STILL
VERY WEAK IN THE AREA.  LAST NIGHT...THE 00Z GFDL MODEL RUN MADE A
DRASTIC CHANGE...SHIFTING THE FORECAST TRACK TO THE EAST...AND THE
06Z RUN OF THIS MODEL TELLS ABOUT THE SAME STORY.  THE 06Z AVN RUN
OF THE NCEP GLOBAL SPECTRAL MODEL SHOWS THAT THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE HAS ENOUGH OF A BREAK IN THE VICINITY OF EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA TO ALLOW BONNIE TO SLIP THROUGH AND INDEED MANY OF THE
TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS NOW SHOW RECURVATURE AWAY FROM THE COAST. 
HOWEVER THE 00Z NAVY NOGAPS MODEL REFUSES TO RECURVE BONNY...AND
BRINGS THE CYCLONE CLOSE TO THE GEORGIA/FLORIDA BORDER BY THE END OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  INTERESTINGLY...IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT 80 PER
CENT OF THE DROPWINDSONDES FROM YESTERDAYS MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL
SAMPLING MISSION ENTERED INTO THAT MODEL SO IT CANNOT BE
DISREGARDED.  ANOTHER COMPLICATING FACTOR IS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH THAT WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS DROPPING INTO THE NORTH-
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.  THIS FEATURE COULD EXERT SOME INFLUENCE ON
THE FUTURE TRACK OF BONNIE AS WELL.

INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS NEAR 100 KNOTS.  EVEN THOUGH THE EYE HAS
DISAPPEARED...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS REPORTED 109 KNOT WINDS NEAR THE
700 MB LEVEL.  IF BONNIE MOVES A BIT MORE...IT WOULD LIKELY
ENCOUNTER WARMER WATERS AND THIS COULD ALLOW STRENGTHENING.  HOWEVER
THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION OF SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR....PARTICULARLY IN
THE AVN MODEL OUTPUT...SO THIS COULD NEGATE STRENGTHENING.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST HOLDS THE WINDS AT 100 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON AUG 24 1998
 
A SLOW MOTION TOWARD THE NORTHWEST IS EVIDENT...ESTIMATED TO BE
325/05.  OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE IS...SHALL I SAY...DIVERGENT.  AT 72
HOURS THERE IS NEARLY A 1200 N MI SPREAD BETWEEN THE MEDIUM
BAM...NEAR THE GEORGIA COAST...AND THE GFDL WHICH RECURVES BONNIE
OUT TO SEA.  THE 12Z AVN SHOWS A 500 MB SHORTWAVE NEARING THE
NORTHEASTERN U.S. IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...BREAKING DOWN THE RIDGE NEAR
MID-ATLANTIC COAST AND ALLOWING BONNIE TO RECURVE OFFSHORE OF THE
NORTH CAROLINA OUTER BANKS.  HOWEVER THE NOGAPS AND U.K. MET. OFFICE
GLOBAL MODELS COMPLICATE THE FORECAST SINCE THEY DO NOT RECURVE THE
HURRICANE AND TAKE IT NEAR TO..OR ACROSS...THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST.
SINCE THE LATTER TWO MODELS ARE RESPECTABLE ONES...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS STILL NOT COMMITTED TO A RECURVATURE.  WITH SUCH DIVERSE
GUIDANCE...OBVIOUSLY OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE 72 HOUR POINT IS NOT THAT
HIGH.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK COUPLED WITH THE LARGE SIZE OF BONNIE...TROPICAL
STORM FORCE WINDS EXTENDING 200 NM OVER THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT...
DICTATE THE ISSUANCE OF A HURRICANE WATCH FOR A PORTION OF THE U.S.
SOUTHEAST COAST.  STRONG WINDS ARE POSSIBLE ON THE COAST IN 36 HOURS
OR LESS.
 
INTENSITY REMAINS UNCHANGED...NEAR 100 KNOTS.  EVEN THOUGH BONNIE
APPEARS TO BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF MODEST WESTERLY SHEAR...THE
HURRICANE HAS SUCH A LARGE AND POWERFUL CIRCULATION SO AS TO BE
RESILIENT TO THE SHEARING.  ALSO...THE HURRICANE WILL LIKELY MOVE
OVER SLIGHTLY WARMER WATERS DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  LITTLE
CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS PREDICTED UNTIL THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD
WHEN CONDITIONS WILL PROBABLY BECOME A LITTLE MORE HOSTILE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON AUG 24 1998
 
BONNIE LOOKS A LITTLE RAGGED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...BUT LATEST RECON
REPORTED 962 MB WHICH IS ABOUT THE SAME AS 18 HOURS AGO.  117 KNOTS
WAS REPORTED FROM ONE OF THE GPS DROPS NEAR THE 900 MB LEVEL IN THE
NORTHWEST EYEWALL.  THEREFORE...INITIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN AT 100
KNOTS.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS WILL LIKELY OCCUR...BUT WITH BONNIE YET TO
CROSS THE WARM GULF STREAM WE WILL MAINTAIN CAT THREE INTENSITY FOR
MOST OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/07.  THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE REMAINS
DIVERGENT AND THEREFORE THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS DIFFICULT.  THE
NAVY NOGAPS HAS BONNIE CENTERED NEAR THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST WHILE
THE GFDL RECURVES THE HURRICANE AND HAS IT MOVING SOUTH OF NOVA
SCOTIA BY THE END OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.  OUR CURRENT TRACK IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH
THE DEEP LAYER BAM AND THE GFDL THROUGH 36 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...
THERE IS A DECENT CHANCE THAT IT WILL BE CAUGHT UP IN THE WESTERLIES
AND RECURVE.  HOWEVER...IF THE PREDICTED INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED
DOES NOT OCCUR...THERE IS STILL A CHANCE THAT BONNIE COULD MOVE TO
THE LEFT OF OUR OFFICIAL TRACK.

5 AM EDT TUE AUG 25 1998
 
LATEST RECON FIXES SHOW A MOTION OF 330/08 OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS
COMPARED TO 325/05 12 HOURS AGO...SO THE FORWARD MOTION APPEARS TO
BE INCREASING. THE PAST 6 HOUR MOTION IS 10 KNOTS.   USING THE
MULTI-AIRCRAFT MISSION DATA AND THE 00Z AVIATION RUN...THE GFDL
MODEL SHOWS ABOUT THE SAME TRACK AS BEFORE...PASSING ABOUT 75 N.MI.
EAST OF THE OUTER BANKS IN 36 HOURS AND THEN ACCELERATING TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST.  THE UKMET SHOWS A LANDFALL IN SOUTHERN N.C. IN ABOUT 60
HOURS AND THE NOGAPS SHOWS A LANDFALL NEAR CHARLESTON IN 48
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE UKMET AND GFDL AND PUTS THE
CENTER ACROSS THE OUTER BANKS IN 36 TO 48 HOURS.
 
THE 34 KNOT WIND RADII IS ABOUT 165 N.M. IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT
BASED ON A GPS DROPSONDE.  ON THE FORECAST TRACK...GALES WILL REACH
THE N.C. COAST IN ABOUT 24 TO 30 HOURS FROM 09Z...SO IT IS TIME TO
PUT UP A HURRICANE WARNING.
 
IF THE NOGAPS TURNS OUT TO BE CORRECT...THE MOVEMENT SHOULD BE
SLOWER AND THERE WILL BE MORE TIME BEFORE WARNINGS ARE NEEDED
FURTHER SOUTH.
 
THE LAST RECON CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 963 MB AND THE 117 KNOT
FLIGHT LEVEL WIND STILL STANDS AS THE HIGHEST WIND SPEED DURING THE
LAST RECON MISSION.  LATER PASSES FAILED TO FIND A WIND NEAR THAT
VALUE...BUT SINCE THE PRESSURE REMAINS THE SAME...THE WIND SPEED
WILL BE KEPT AT 100 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST WIND SPEED IS THE SAME AS
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT TUE AUG 25 1998
 
MODEST CHANGES TO TRACK THIS MORNING CAN BE INTERPRETED IN TWO WAYS.
WHILE BONNIE HAS ACCELERATED FROM 10 KT TO ABOUT 14 KT...SUGGESTING
THAT IT WILL GET CAUGHT UP IN THE APPROACHING SHORT-WAVE TROUGH OVER
THE GREAT LAKES STATES...THE HEADING HAS STAYED ABOUT THE SAME OR
EVEN EDGED 5 DEGREES TO THE LEFT...ARGUING FOR A DELAY IN ANY TURN.
ALTERNATELY...THESE VARIATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARY. IN ANY
CASE...BONNIE IS QUICKLY APPROACHING THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA AND
ALL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE MADE NOW FOR A POWERFUL HURRICANE THERE.
 
THE TRACK GUIDANCE HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS WITH
MOST FORECASTS SUPPORTING THE CURRENT NHC TRACK WHICH IS A LITTLE
FASTER AND A BIT TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THIS
FORECAST IMPLIES THAT TROPICAL STORM WINDS WILL ARRIVE ON THE NORTH
CAROLINA AND THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST NEAR MIDNIGHT AND HURRICANE
FORCE WINDS NEAR DAWN TOMORROW.
 
WESTERLY SHEAR AND AN INFLUX OF SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR INTO THE
SOUTHWEST SECTOR HAS LED TO A MORE RAGGED APPEARANCE TO BONNIE ON
SATELLITE PICTURES.  WHILE THERE IS NO EYE APPARENT ON
SATELLITE...OR TO THE HURRICANE HUNTERS...THE RECON RECENTLY
REPORTED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 964 MB.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT...DESPITE
THE APPEARANCE...BONNIE HAS PROBABLY NOT CHANGED MUCH IN INTENSITY.
INDEED...AN EXPERIMENTAL RUN OF THE GFDL...COUPLED WITH AN OCEAN
MODEL...INDICATES THAT SOME STRENGTHENING REMAINS POSSIBLE DURING
THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

WHILE THE OVERALL MOTION REMAINS TOWARD ABOUT 325/330 DEGREES AT 14
KT...SATELLITE PICTURES CLEARLY SHOW SOME POTENTIALLY DECEPTIVE
NORTHWESTWARD WOBBLING OF THE EYE ALONG THAT TRACK.  SOME EVIDENCE
OF AN EYEWALL IS NOW SEEN IN THE IMAGERY AND THE HURRICANE HUNTERS
REPORTED AN OPEN...ELLIPTICAL SHAPE EYE BEFORE THEY DEPARTED A FEW
HOURS AGO.  THEY MEASURED FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS A LITTLE IN EXCESS OF
100 KT TWICE TODAY IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE CENTRAL PRESSURE
AT 1738Z...THE LAST FIX BEFORE ABOUT 00Z...WAS ONCE AGAIN 963 MB. 
BASED ON RECENT SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS...THE NEXT MEASURED PRESSURE
COULD BE LOWER.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 100 KT.
 
THE 12Z GUIDANCE SHOWS MUCH MORE CONSISTENCY THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
ALL DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE NOW SHOWS THE CENTER MAKING LANDFALL IN
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA OR PASSING JUST OFFSHORE. THIS IS GENERALLY
FOLLOWED BY A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST WITH ACCELERATION.  WHILE
THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE FORWARD SPEED...THE
CONSENSUS IS QUITE SIMILAR TO OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH IS CLOSELY
FOLLOWED FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS.  OUR TRACK FROM 36 TO 72 HOURS IS
OFFSET ABOUT 45 NMI TO THE RIGHT OF 6 HOURS AGO.  ALL DYNAMICAL
GUIDANCE EXCEPT NOGAPS IS EVEN FARTHER OFFSHORE...TO THE RIGHT.
THESE MODEST CHANGES ARE BASED ON THE EXPECTATION THAT THE
APPROACHING SHORT-WAVE TROUGHS WILL TURN BONNIE TO THE NORTH LATER
TONIGHT AND THEN ACCELERATE IT NORTHEASTWARD BY THURSDAY.

THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING FROM CAPE ROMAIN TO MURRELLS INLET IS
CHANGED TO A HURRICANE WARNING ON THIS ADVISORY.

HURRICANE BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  28
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT TUE AUG 25 1998
 
FORWARD SPEED APPEARS TO HAVE SLOWED JUST A BIT...TO NEAR 12 KNOTS.
OTHERWISE THE TRACK IS ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE...AND ALL OF OUR
GUIDANCE...ASIDE FROM SHALLOW LAYER STEERING WHICH IS NOT VALID FOR
A HURRICANE...SHOW A TURN TO THE NORTH BY MORNING.  SO...VERY LITTLE
CHANGE IS MADE FROM THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST.  IN FACT...THE
SLIGHT SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED MAY BE PRESAGING A CHANGE IN
DIRECTION.  A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS APPROACHING
THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND THIS FEATURE SHOULD BRING ABOUT THE
EXPECTED TURN TO THE RIGHT.  IN 24 TO 36 HOURS BONNIE IS EXPECTED TO
BE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD WITH AN ACCELERATING FORWARD SPEED.
 
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE NORTHWARD TURN HAS NOT TAKEN
PLACE YET.  HOWEVER...WE EMPHASIZE THAT ONE SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON THE
PRECISE TRACK...ESPECIALLY SINCE BONNIE HAS SUCH A LARGE ENVELOPE OF
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS.  EVEN IF THE CURRENT NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION
CONTINUES LONGER THAN FORECAST...BONNIE WOULD STILL MAKE LANDFALL
WITHIN THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA.
 
INTENSITY IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED.  HURRICANE HUNTERS COULD NOT
FIND AN EYE...YET THEY FOUND WINDS TO 114 KNOTS AT THE 700 MB FLIGHT
LEVEL OVER THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT A FEW HOURS AGO.  CLOUD TOPS ON
SATELLITE IMAGERY ARE NOT VERY COLD AND DVORAK ESTIMATES OF
INTENSITY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE PROVIDED BY THE
AIRCRAFT.  THIS UNDERSCORES THE GREAT VALUE OF AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE
IN HURRICANES THAT ARE THREATENING POPULATED COASTAL AREAS.
 
EVEN THOUGH SOME FLUCTUATIONS ARE POSSIBLE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
IN INTENSITY IS FORECAST UNTIL BONNIE PASSES THE OUTER BANKS.
WEAKENING IS FORECAST LATER ON AS IT ENCOUNTERS WESTERLY SHEAR AND
COOLER WATERS.

LATEST RECON FIX GIVES A MOTION OF 320/12 OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS BUT
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS MOTION SUGGESTS MORE OF A NORTHWARD DIRECTION.
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/12.  ALL GUIDANCE SHOWS AN
IMMEDIATE TURN TOWARD THE NORTH EXCEPT THE UKMET WHICH CONTINUES A

FORECAST DISREGARDS THE UKMET AND MAKES A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST

PERHAPS THE EXTENSION OF THE WARNING TO EDISTO BEACH WILL TURN OUT
TO HAVE BEEN UNNECESSARY...BUT THERE IS NO POINT IN AGONIZING ABOUT
IT.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWS RAPID ACCELERATION AFTER 24 HOURS
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK SHOWS THE CENTER CROSSING THE COAST JUST SOUTH OF

RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT...AND SATELLITE NOW HINT AT THE EXPECTED
TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE INITIAL MOTION...AVERAGED OVER THE PAST
6 HOURS...IS 340 DEGREES WHILE A VERY SHORT-TERM MOTION IS DUE
NORTH.  WE WILL USE 350/10 KT.  THE REDUCED SPEED IS ALSO CONSISTENT
WITH THE FIRST STAGES OF A TURN IN THE TRACK.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
AGAIN ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 100 KT.
 
THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH FEATURES TO THE NNW OF BONNIE APPEAR MORE
PROMINENTLY ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THAN 24 HOUR AGO.  THE SOUTHERN
EXTENT OF THE APPROACHING TROUGH IS FARTHER SOUTH THAN YESTERDAY AS
WELL...AND THIS LENDS ADDITIONAL CONFIDENCE TO THE EXPECTATION THAT
THE HURRICANE WILL SOON BE CAUGHT UP IN THE MIDDLE LATITUDE FLOW AND
EVENTUALLY ACCELERATE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.  THE 06Z AVN AND GFDL
RUNS SHOW THAT EVOLUTION...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL TRACK.
 
IN THE SHORT-TERM...THE GREATER NORTHWARD COMPONENT SUGGESTS A TRACK
A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF 6 HOURS AGO.  THE RATHER SLOW MOTION LIKELY
MEANS A PROLONGED...12-18 HOUR...BATTERING BY STRONG WINDS FOR SOME
PORTIONS OF EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA.  IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE STORM
SURGE WILL PERSIST LONG ENOUGH TO BE INFLUENCED BY AT LEAST TWO
DIFFERENT HIGH TIDES BEFORE BONNIE LEAVES THE AREA.
 
WITH THE CENTER NOW OFFSHORE FROM THE NORTHERN PART OF SOUTH
CAROLINA AND WITH A NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OBSERVED...THE WARNINGS AND
WATCHES SOUTH OF CAPE ROMAIN SOUTH CAROLINA ARE DISCONTINUED.

HURRICANE BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  32
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT WED AUG 26 1998
 
A NEW AND POTENTIALLY SERIOUS FORECAST PROBLEM HAS ARISEN.
AT THE MOMENT...BONNIE IS MOVING NORTHWARD AT 5 TO 10 KT...AND ITS
CENTER IS COMING ASHORE.  HOWEVER...SEVERAL OF TODAY/S COMPUTER
SIMULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE NEARBY SHORT-WAVE COULD BYPASS THE
HURRICANE...LEAVING IT TO MOVE VERY SLOWLY FOR A DAY OR TWO.  IF
THIS OCCURS...IT COULD CREATE AN ENORMOUS FLOOD PROBLEM.
 
SUPPORTING THIS CONSIDERATION IS WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WHICH SHOWS THE
NEARBY SHORT-WAVE TROUGH AXIS NOW APPROACHING THE LONGITUDE OF
BONNIE.  THE NE-SW STRETCHING OF THE UPPER LEVEL CLOUD PATTERN ALSO
SUGGESTS THAT THE TROUGH MIGHT BE EXERTING ITS MAXIMUM INFLUENCE ON
THE MOTION OF BONNIE AT THIS TIME.

FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE...THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS SLOWED CONSIDERABLY
THROUGH 36 HOURS...AND NOW KEEPS THE CENTER OVER EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA THROUGH THAT PERIOD.  THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO THE GFDL
FORECAST.
 
A NOAA RESEARCH AIRCRAFT REPORTED 116 KT AT THE 8000 FT FLIGHT
LEVEL.  A DROPWINDSONDE RELEASED EARLY THIS AFTERNOON BY THE AIR
FORCE MEASURED 110 KT IN THE EASTERN EYEWALL NOT FAR ABOVE THE
SURFACE.  ESTIMATED MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS ARE 100 KT.  WEAKENING
WILL OCCUR AFTER LANDFALL.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS FROM VIRGINIA NORTHWARD HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO
ACCOMMODATE THE CHANGE IN FORECAST TRACK.
 
THE HURRICANE HUNTERS RECENTLY EXTRAPOLATED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF
959 MB.  DROPSONDE PRESSURES...NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS FIX...HAVE
BEEN CONSISTENTLY 3 OR 4 MB HIGHER.

RADAR...SURFACE DATA...AND RECON INDICATE LITTLE MOVEMENT...PERHAPS
A SLIGHT NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD DRIFT...OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. 
THE CENTER HAS BEEN HUGGING THE COASTLINE BUT IT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE
SLOWLY ACROSS EXTREME EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA DURING THE NEXT 24
HOURS IN AGREEMENT WITH MOST OF OUR OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTIONS. 
THE NHC FORECAST ALSO SHOWS A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST AND EAST-
NORTHEAST LATER IN THE PERIOD...WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE GFDL TRACK.

THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF BONNIE WILL LIKELY PRODUCE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF
RAINFALL.  TOTALS UP TO 20 INCHES OR SO ARE SHOWN BY THE LATEST GFDL
RUN.  THIS WOULD CREATE A SERIOUS FLOOD PROBLEM.  

THE CIRCULATION IS GRADUALLY WEAKENING AS IT INTERACTS WITH LAND. 
MAXIMUM DOPPLER RADAR VELOCITIES FROM THE WSR-88D ARE BARELY 90
KNOTS AT 4000 TO 5000 FT TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  CURRENT
INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 85 KNOTS AND GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD

...CORRECTION FOR FORCAST POSITIONS AND INLAND DESIGNATIONS...
 
RADAR AND AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE FIXES OVER THE LAST

A SLOW PACE.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 020/04 KNOTS.
LATEST RECON WINDS ARE SHOWING A MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND OF

HURRICANE FORCE WINDS WITH ONLY TROPICAL STORM REPORTS.  THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 75 KNOTS.  FURTHER SLOW
WEAKENING IS FORECAST AS THE SYSTEM TRAVERSES LAND OVER THE

NWS DOPPLER RADAR DISPLAYS SUGGEST THAT MAXIMUM SUSTAINED SURFACE
WINDS IN BONNIE HAVE DROPPED BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH.  THE CENTER
PASSED NEAR NEW BERN AND CHERRY PT MCAS AROUND 13Z...WITH PRESSURES
DROPPING TO ABOUT 983 MB.  THESE DATA SUPPORT DOWNGRADING BONNIE TO
A TROPICAL STORM...WITH 55 KT WINDS AND SOME GUSTS STILL TO
HURRICANE FORCE...MAINLY OVER THE WATERS TO THE EAST.
 
THE MOTION ESTIMATE IS 035 DEGREES AT 5 KT AND THE FORECAST TRACK IS
LITTLE CHANGED.  THIS KEEPS THE POTENTIAL HIGH FOR FLOODING RAINS
OVER EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA THROUGH TONIGHT.  SOME INCREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED IS PREDICTED...IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT GFDL OUTPUT.
THE SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO REMAIN AT TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH AFTER
EXITING THE COAST AND COULD PASS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE NORTHEASTERN
STATES TO CAUSE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS ALONG/NEAR THE COAST.

DOPPLER RADAR DATA AND OBSERVATIONS FROM OCRACOKE ISLAND AND DIAMOND

BIT AT THE SURFACE AS THE CIRCULATION BEGINS TO MOVE BACK OVER
WATER.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE NOW ESTIMATED AT 60 KT WITH GUSTS TO

DOPPLER RADAR DATA ALSO SHOWS AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED TO ABOUT
8 KT ALONG A HEADING OF 45 DEGREES.  MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE
SHOWS AN ACCELERATION OFFSHORE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND THEN THE

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 055/22.  ALL OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS
HAVE THE STORM ACCELERATING NORTHEAST AND THEN EASTWARD AS IT IS
PICKED UP BY THE WESTERLIES.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS TRACK.
 
THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED TO 50 KNOTS BASED ON DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES AND SURFACE WIND OBSERVATIONS.  A BAND OF DEEP CONVECTION
IS LOCATED TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER...AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS
VERY LITTLE CLOUDINESS REMAINING ON THE WEST HALF OF THE STORM...THE
SYSTEM STILL HAS MORE TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS THAN EXTRATROPICAL. 
THE FORECAST WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS THROUGH 24 HOURS WHEN
THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO BE EXTRATROPICAL.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 060/24.  ALL OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS
HAVE THE STORM ACCELERATING EAST-NORTHEAST AND THEN EASTWARD AS IT
IS PICKED UP BY THE WESTERLIES.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS TRACK...BUT SLIGHTLY FASTER.
 
THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED TO 45 KNOTS BASED ON DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES AND SURFACE WIND OBSERVATIONS.  LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE
PICTURES SHOW THAT THE DEEP CONVECTION IS DECREASING.  THE SYSTEM IS
TAKING ON MORE EXTRATROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS AS IT MERGES WITH THE
TROUGH APPROACHING FROM THE WEST.  THE WIND SPEED IS CARRIED AT 45
KNOTS THROUGH 12 HOURS WHEN THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO BE
EXTRATROPICAL.

MAXIMUM WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 50 KT BASED ON OBSERVATIONS FROM
CANADIAN BUOY 44137...SABLE ISLAND AND A SHIP REPORT.  THE PRESSURE
IS ALSO ADJUSTED DOWNWARD USING THEIR DATA.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 065/30 KT.  BONNY IS ACCELERATING AHEAD OF THE
IMPULSE SEEN IN WV IMAGERY EXITING MAINE.  TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS A
CONTINUATION OF THIS MOTION FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A TURN
TOWARD THE EAST.
  
BASED ON THE CURRENT OBSERVATIONS...BONNIE RETAINS SOME TROPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS...BUT WE STILL EXPECT TO DECLARE IT EXTRATROPICAL
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

TROPICAL STORM BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  46
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SUN AUG 30 1998
 
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM SABLE ISLAND SHOW THAT THE CENTER PASSED
JUST SOUTH OF THAT LOCATION AT 02Z.  A 65 KNOT WIND FROM AN OIL RIG
JUST EAST OF SABLE ISLAND...ANEMOMETER ELEVATION OVER 100
METERS...INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM STILL HAS STRONG WINDS TO THE
NORTH OF THE CENTER AS WELL AS TO THE SOUTH.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 070/30.  A MOSTLY EASTWARD MOTION
SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL THE SYSTEM IS ABSORBED BY A LARGE
EXTRATROPICAL LOW IN THE EASTERN NORTH ATLANTIC IN ABOUT 48 HOURS. 
THERE IS SOME DEEP CONVECTION...BUT IT IS WELL EAST OF THE CENTER
AND THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION IS COMPLETELY EXPOSED.  BONNIE IS
QUICKLY BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL OVER THE COLD WATERS OF THE NORTH
ATLANTIC.

TROPICAL STORM BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  47
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT SUN AUG 30 1998

THE SYSTEM DOES NOT LOOK VERY TROPICAL ON SATELLITE IMAGERY AND
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT THE WIND FIELD IS SPREADING OUT AND
WEAKENING.  BONNIE IS BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL AND THIS IS THE LAST
ADVISORY.  FUTURE INFORMATION ON THE REMNANT LOW WILL BE CONTAINED
IN THE HIGH SEAS FORECASTS ISSUED BY THE MARINE PREDICTION CENTER IN
WASHINGTON.

A MOSTLY EASTWARD...SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF EAST...MOTION IS FORECAST FOR
THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  THE SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO BE ABSORBED BY A LARGE
EXTRATROPICAL LOW OVER THE EASTERN NORTH ATLANTIC IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS.
