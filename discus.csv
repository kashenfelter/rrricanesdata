NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON JUL 27 1998

SHIP REPORTS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY INCLUDING SCATTEROMETER WINDS
INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM JUST OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA HAS A WELL-
DEFINED SURFACE CIRCULATION AND WE ARE IDENTIFYING IT AS TROPICAL
DEPRESSION NUMBER ONE.

TRACKING OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS GIVES A MOTION OF 280/24.  THE 00Z
AVIATION MODEL RUN SHOWS STEERING CURRENTS MUCH WEAKER THAN 24 KNOTS
SO THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS REDUCED TO 280/20.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE LITTLE CHANGE IN MOTION OVER THE NEXT 72
HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES ALONG WITH THIS.

THERE WERE THREE SHIPS AT 06Z IN THIS SYSTEM SHOWING A CLOSED
CIRCULATION OF ABOUT 15 KNOTS.  HOWEVER THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF
DEEP CONVECTION AND THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS ESTIMATED AT 25 KNOTS.

THE SHIPS STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL SHOWS THAT
CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING...SSTS ARE PLENTY
WARM AND THERE IS LITTLE VERTICAL SHEAR TO INHIBIT DEVELOPMENT.

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS SHOWS THAT WHILE
THE LOW LEVEL CENTER REMAINS FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED...CONVECTION HAS
DIMINISHED AROUND THE CENTER.  THUS...THE INTENSITY WILL BE
MAINTAINED AT 25 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION
OF THE SYSTEM IS RATHER IMPRESSIVE WITH GOOD OUTFLOW ESTABLISHED
OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS...AND CALLS FOR SOME GRADUAL STRENGTHENING THROUGH THE
PERIOD.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SHIPS STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL
INTENSITY MODEL. 

RECENT SATELLITE FIXES PLACE THE CENTER A BIT FURTHER NORTHWARD... 
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/18 KNOTS.  A MID-LEVEL
RIDGE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD KEEP IT ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK THROUGH ABOUT 48 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE AVIATION MODEL
BRINGS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROF/LOW SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR 40W.    
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST SHOWS A GRADUAL DECELERATION DUE TO 
THIS FEATURE.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE DISCUSSION NUMBER   3
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON JUL 27 1998

THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION HAS A LARGE BUT ELONGATED ENVELOPE AND IT
LACKS OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  SINCE THE DEPRESSION IS
OVER WARM WATERS...THE OUTFLOW IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND HAS SUCH A
LARGE ENVELOPE...I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT...TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING.  
HOWEVER... SINCE THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM IN 12 HOURS AND
SHIPS MODEL BRINGS THE SYSTEM TO 49 KNOTS...ONLY A SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. 

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON IR IMAGES AND THE
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/18.  ALL OF THE MODELS
THAT DEPEND ON THE AVN FORECAST FIELDS TURN THE DEPRESSION TO THE
NORTHWEST BY 48 HOURS.  THIS TURN IS CAUSED BY A DEVELOPING
MID-LEVEL TROUGH AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WHICH IS FORECAST BY THE AVN. 
ON THE OTHER HAND...THE UK AND NOGAPS MODELS MAINTAIN MORE OF A 500
MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THAT PATTERN WOULD
SUGGEST A WEST TO WEST NORTHWEST TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS TO THE LEFT OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE BUT VERY CLOSE TO CLIPER.
THERE IS TIME TO ADJUST THE FORECAST TRACK MORE TO THE
NORTHWEST...IF NECESSARY.  

NOGAPS TRACKING ALGORITHM DROPS THE DEPRESSION IN 12 HOURS OR SO 
BUT AN INSPECTION OF LOW-LEVEL FIELDS FROM THE 12Z RUN...ONE CAN
OBSERVE A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOVING DISTURBANCE WHICH APPROACHES
THE LESSER ANTILLES IN 5 DAYS OR SO.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE DISCUSSION NUMBER   4
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT TUE JUL 28 1998

THE DEPRESSION HAS NOT BECOME ANY BETTER ORGANIZED...AND THE CLOUD
PATTERN REMAINS ELONGATED FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING FROM NEAR 30N 20W
SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR 20N 30W...WHICH MAY BE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DISTORTION OF THE CLOUD PATTERN.  MOREOVER THE CYCLONE IS STILL 
INVOLVED WITH THE LOW-LEVEL MONSOONAL FLOW FEEDING TOWARDS WESTERN
AFRICA.  THE ABOVE TWO FACTORS MAY BE PREVENTING THE DEPRESSION FROM
STRENGTHENING AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
RUN SHOWS THE UPPER TROUGH MIGRATING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AND A MORE
ANTICYCLONIC FLOW BUILDING OVER THE AREA OF THE DEPRESSION.  ALSO AS
THE DEPRESSION MOVES FARTHER WEST IT SHOULD ESCAPE FROM THE MONSOON
TROUGH AND PERHAPS ENCOUNTER BETTER LOW-LEVEL INFLOW.  ONLY TIME
WILL TELL OF COURSE.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND CALLS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING...BUT ONE SHOULD
BEAR IN MIND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EXCEEDINGLY LIMITED SKILL IN
INTENSITY PREDICTION.

IT IS NOT EASY TO FIX A CENTER FROM INFRARED IMAGERY...BUT THE BEST
ESTIMATE IS THAT THE FORWARD MOTION HAS SLOWED A LITTLE MORE.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THAT FROM THE LAST ADVISORY
BUT SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THIS IS CLOSEST TO THE SHALLOW-LAYER STEERING.

IF THE SYSTEM WERE TO STRENGTHEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN
FORECAST...IT WOULD LIKELY TURN MORE NORTHWESTWARD IN RESPONSE TO
THE HIGHER-LEVEL TROUGH TO ITS NORTH.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/17...SAME AS LAST ADVISORY.  THE
00Z RUN OF THE AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE DEPRESSION TURNING TOWARD
THE NORTH-NORTHWEST IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS...APPARENTLY FINDING A
WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE.  THE UKMET SHOWS
MORE OF A WEST-NORTHEWESTWARD TRACK WHILE THE NOGAPS AND GFDL MODELS
LOSE THE CIRCULATION BY 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND
OF ALL OF THE GUIDANCE AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...
CALLING FOR A SLIGHT TURN TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND SOME
DECELERATION.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A FAIRLY-WELL ORGANIZED LOW LEVEL
CIRCULATION BUT THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED THIS MORNING. 
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE FROM T NUMBERS 2.0 TO 2.5.  THE
WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 30 KNOTS AND GRADUAL STRENGHENING IS
FORECAST AS THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF STRONG VERTICAL WIND SHEAR DURING

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/21 AND THIS IS SOMEWHAT FASTER
THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE
DEPRESSION TURNING TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHWEST INTO A WEAKNESS IN THE
SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE...THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME SCENARIO
AS THE 00Z MODEL RUN AND ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE
SIMILAR TO THE LAST PACKAGE.  SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY EXCEPT A LITTLE FASTER DURING THE
FIRST 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY CONSIDERABLE DECELERATION.  AS
BEFORE...THE GFDL AND NOGAPS MODELS LOSE THE CIRCULATION IN 24
HOURS.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A WELL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CLOUD STRUCTURE AND
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE AT MINIMAL TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH WHILE KGWC GAVE A 2.0 T NUMBER.   HOWEVER I PREFER TO
WAIT FOR THE APPEARANCE OF SOME MORE DEEP CONVECTION BEFORE
UPGRADING TO A TROPICAL STORM.  THE FORECAST...AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...IS FOR GRADUAL STRENGTHENING FOLLOWING THE SHIPS
STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL.  

THIS SYSTEM IS FAIRLY LARGE AND THE WIND SPEED RADII IN THE
FORECAST/ADVISORY ARE INCREASED A LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS BLOSSOMED A LITTLE THIS EVENING NEAR THE
CIRCULATION CENTER AND IN A BAND IN THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THIS
DEVELOPMENT...ALONG WITH TAFB AND SAB GIVING DVORAK TECHNIQUE
T-NUMBERS OF 2.5...SUPPORT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM
ALEX WITH 35 KT WINDS.  THE SPURT IN FORWARD SPEED NOTED EARLIER
TODAY SEEMS TO HAVE ENDED AND INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT
280/18 KT.
 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION WITH MULTIPLE
VORTICES TO THE NORTH TO NE OF THE TROPICAL STORM.  THE 12Z AVN
HAS THIS FEATURE PRIMARILY IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE...PERHAPS MOST
DISTINCT NEAR 300 MB.  AT 500 MB...IT SHOWS A WESTWARD RETROGRESSION
OF AN ANTICYCLONE FROM 35-40W TO 55-60W OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS...BUT
INDICATES THAT THE HIGH WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT ALEX
FROM GRADUALLY ACQUIRING A GREATER NORTHWARD COMPONENT.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT IDEA...AS IS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
WHICH IS A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.  FURTHER
DECELERATION IS ALSO PREDICTED.  ALTERNATELY...THE 12Z NOGAPS SHOWS
THE RETROGRADING HIGH TO BE STRONGER...AND KEEPS THE STORM AT FAIRLY
LOW LATITUDE...LOCATED ABOUT 200 NM SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST POINT AT
72 HOURS.
 
ALTHOUGH SOME MID-LEVEL MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE HEADING NORTHEASTWARD
AWAY FROM THE CENTER...MOST FACTORS INFLUENCING INTENSITY...AS
INDICATED BY THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST GUIDANCE...POINT TOWARD
STRENGTHENING.
 
A SHIP REPORT OF 10 KT 150 NM TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE SYSTEM AT 18Z
SUGGESTS THAT THE WIND RADII ARE NOT TOO LARGE AS YET...AT LEAST IN
THAT PART OF THE CIRCULATION.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT WED JUL 29 1998

DEEP CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED NEAR THE ESTIMATED CENTER...BUT THERE
ARE NO BANDING FEATURES EVIDENT AT THIS TIME.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 35 KNOTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM THE
TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THAT ALEX IS
MOVING INTO A COL IN THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW...SUGGESTING A WEAK SHEAR
ENVIRONMENT.  SO...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  THIS IS ALSO IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...GUIDANCE.  

ALTHOUGH THE CYCLONE APPEARS TO HAVE A LARGE CIRCULATION ENVELOPE...
CURRENTLY THE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION IS RELATIVELY SMALL.  THUS THE
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII ARE NOT ESTIMATED TO BE VERY LARGE
AT THIS TIME.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THERE IS QUITE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN THE
OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS.  DEEP LAYER STEERING FROM THE
AVIATION MODEL SHOWS A MORE NORTHWESTWARD COURSE DEVELOPING SOON. 
THIS APPEARS TO BE DUE TO MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL VORTICITY BEING DRAWN
SOUTHWESTWARD AHEAD OF ALEX...FROM A TROUGH THAT IS NOW NORTH OF THE
STORM.  HOWEVER THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS ALSO SHOW A STRONG MID-
TROPOSPHERIC HIGH NORTH OF 20N AND WEST OF 50W IN DAY OR TWO.  IF
THE ABOVEMENTIONED VORTICITY FEATURE IS NOT SO PROMINENT...THEN ALEX
MAY BE FORCED ON A MORE WESTWARD TRACK.  INDEED...THIS IS WHAT IS
SUGGESTED BY THE LATEST GFDL GUIDANCE.  FOR NOW...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SHIFTED ONLY SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES THIS MORNING SHOWS THAT THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER OF ALEX IS WEST OF THE LIMITED DEEP CONVECTION...AND THIS

ALEX IS MOVING INTO A COL IN THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW SUGGESTING A
WEAKER SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT ANALYSES
FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES.

THUS...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST WITH THE INTENSIFICATION TREND FROM
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY PRESERVED.    
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 280/17 KNOTS.  THE 12Z TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A BIT LESS SCATTER THAN EARLIER WITH MOST
INDICATING A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE AND A SLOWING IN FORWARD
SPEED BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE PRIMARY QUESTION REGARDING THE
TRACK FORECAST REMAINS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW NEAR
25N55W WHICH WOULD IMPART A MORE NORTHERLY COMPONENT OF MOTION.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS MADE A BIT OF A COMEBACK DURING THE DAY ALTHOUGH
IT IS NOT TERRIBLY WELL-ORGANIZED.  THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT IS
THAT THE CONVECTION IS FORMING CLOSER TO THE CENTER SUGGESTING THAT
ALEX IS MOVING INTO A LIGHTER VERTICAL SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  HOWEVER
...THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF OUTFLOW AND THE DRIER AIR NOTED IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WEST OF ALEX IS NOT CONDUCIVE FOR STRENGTHENING.
OVERALL...THE SYSTEM DOES NOT LOOK VERY HEALTHY AND THE CURRENT
INTENSITY IS HELD AT 35 KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL FORECAST TO
GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN WITH PROGRESSIVELY WARMER SST/S AHEAD AND
IMPROVING UPPER ENVIRONMENT. 

A NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHIC OFFICE DRIFTING BUOY LOCATED ABOUT 100 NM
WEST-NORTHWEST OF THE CENTER REPORTED A 10 METER/6 MINUTE WIND OF 
31 KNOTS AND A PRESSURE OF 1013 MB AT 18Z.  THIS IS CONSISTENT 
WITH OUR CURRENT TROPICAL STORM RADII.
  
THE CENTER HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO LOCATE DURING THE DAY. 
CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE SATELLITE FIXES SUGGEST THE CENTER IS A 
TAD SOUTH AND IS MOVING SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 275/14 KNOTS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A COMPLEX
UPPER AIR PATTERN OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  THE AVIATION MODEL
DEVELOPS A MID-TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
AS A RESULT...THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS SHOW A GENERAL
WESTERLY TRACK THROUGH 36 HOURS...FOLLOWED BY A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST
COURSE.  THE GFDL AND NOGAPS ARE THE SOUTHERN-MOST TRACKS.  WHILE
THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER FEATURES

SATELLITE PICTURES OF ALEX SHOW A LESS COHERENT PATTERN THAN 24
HOURS AGO.  DEEP CONVECTION IS LIMITED AND NOT WELL ORGANIZED AND
THE OVERALL CONFIGURATION...PARTICULARLY AT MID LEVELS...HAS BEEN
ELONGATED FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST BY AN INTERACTION WITH A
COMPLEX CYCLONIC CIRCULATION SEEN NEARBY IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.
THE INITIAL WIND SPEED FOR THIS ADVISORY IS AGAIN 35 KT.
 
ALEX IS MOVING JUST NORTH OF DUE WEST AT ABOUT 13 KT.  WHETHER ALEX
HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE LESSER ANTILLES DEPENDS ON HOW SOON AND
HOW MUCH THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH IS ERODED
WHEN THE LONGWAVE TROUGH ALONG THE EAST COAST IS REINFORCED.
YESTERDAY...THE 12Z NOGAPS SEEMED TO PROVIDE THE BEST GUIDANCE...
KEEPING A STRONGER HIGH TO THE NORTH AND A MORE WESTERLY TRACK THAN
SHOWN BY THE OTHER MODELS.  THERE IS A SIMILAR DIFFERENCE TODAY WITH
THE NEW 18Z AVN NOW ALSO SHOWING A PROLONGED WESTWARD HEADING...
THROUGH 36-48 HOURS.  IN DEFERENCE TO YESTERDAYS PARTIAL
VERIFICATION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
CLUSTER OF 12Z AVN-BASED TRACKS...BUT NOT AS FAR SOUTH AS THE
NOGAPS.
  
INTENSIFICATION IS STILL POSSIBLE AND THE GFDL AND SHIPS SCHEMES
BRING ALEX TO THE THRESHOLD OF HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 72 HOURS.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST ALSO SHOWS STRENGTHENING...BUT THIS IS POSTPONED
ABOUT A DAY...UNTIL THE PERIOD WHEN THE AVN SHOWS A SOMEWHAT MORE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

THE STORM CONTINUES TO LOOK LESS-ORGANIZED THAN IT DID 24 HOURS
AGO...AND MAXIMUM WIND ESTIMATE IS UNCHANGED FOR THIS ADVISORY. 
INFRARED IMAGERY SHOWS SOUTHERLY SHEARING OVER ALEX...ALTHOUGH WATER
VAPOR ANIMATION SUGGESTS FAIRLY WEAK SHEAR JUST AHEAD.  SINCE THE
SYSTEM HAS FAILED TO STRENGTHEN SIGNIFICANTLY THUS FAR...NO CHANGE
IS FORECAST FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS WITH ONLY A MODEST INCREASE
THEREAFTER.  THE SHIPS MODEL GIVES A SIMILAR INTENSITY FORECAST.

MOTION CONTINUES SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WEST AROUND 13 KT.  ACCORDING TO
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...A MID/UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE/VORTMAX IS
PREDICTED TO BE BETWEEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND ALEX IN 2-3 DAYS. 
THIS FEATURE...IF IT VERIFIES...WOULD INDUCE A MORE NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE LATEST NOGAPS RUN PAINTS A
SIMILAR PICTURE.  HOWEVER...THE 00Z GFDL MODEL RUN SHOWS A MORE
SOUTHERN TRACK.  IN DEFERENCE TO THE LATTER MODEL...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST ONLY BENDS THE TRACK TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST DURING THE
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS NHC
FORECAST.

11 AM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

THERE IS AN AREA OF CONCENTRATED CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND
CONSEQUENTLY THE DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE 3.0 FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.
THEREFORE...THE WINDS ARE ADJUSTED TO 45 KNOTS.  THE OUTFLOW IS
PARTIALLY RESTRICTED BUT IS ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM. THERE ARE
HOSTILE UPPER LEVEL WINDS AHEAD OF THE STORM...HOWEVER ...GLOBAL
MODELS SUGGEST THAT THESE WESTERLIES WILL WEAKEN OR RETROGRADE AND
THEN SOME SOUTHERLY SHEAR MAY DEVELOP. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS
FOR SOME STRENGTHENING SINCE THE GFDL AND SHIPS MODELS BRING THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE TO 65 TO 65 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.  ON THE LONGER
RANGE...4-5 DAYS... THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS BECOME A LITTLE MORE
FAVORABLE IN THE AREA BETWEEN PUERTO RICO AND BERMUDA.

ALEX IS CURRENTLY MOVING AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A WELL ESTABLISHED
DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE AT ABOUT 280/13.  THIS RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
HAVE A WEAKNESS ALONG 60-65 WEST. THIS WOULD INDUCE A TRACK MORE TO
THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
ON THIS TRACK...ALEX WOULD SKIRT THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS BUT
THEY STILL NEED TO MONITOR THIS STORM. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY
CLOSE TO THE GFDL BUT TO THE SOUTH OF MOST OF THE OTHER GUIDANCE.  

THE HIGH ALTITUDE NOOA JET IS SCHEDULED TO SAMPLE THE ENVIRONMENT
SURROUNDING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE LATE FRIDAY.

5 PM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

ALEX HAS MAINTAINED ITS DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER DURING THE
PAST SEVERAL HOURS WHILE THE OUTFLOW IS BECOMING A LITTLE BETTER
ORGANIZED.  HOWEVER...T-NUMBERS REMAIN ABOUT 3.0 SO THE WINDS ARE
KEPT AT 45 KNOTS AT THIS TIME. ALEX IS DEFINITIVELY BETTER ORGANIZED
THAN YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME. A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AHEAD OF THE STORM BUT IT WILL BE WEAK ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME
SLOW STRENGTHENING OF THE STORM.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS ALEX
TO A 65-KNOT HURRICANE BY 48 HOURS AS SUGGESTED BY THE GFDL AND
SHIPS MODELS.  ON THE LONGER RANGE...4-5 DAYS... THE UPPER LEVEL
WINDS BECOME A LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE IN THE AREA BETWEEN PUERTO RICO
AND BERMUDA.

MOST OF THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE SAME SCENARIO. A WELL
ESTABLISHED DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE WHICH IS FORECAST TO HAVE A
WEAKNESS ALONG 60-65 WEST.  THIS PATTERN WOULD INDUCE A TRACK MORE
TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  ON THIS TRACK...THE CORE OF ALEX WOULD SKIRT THE NORTHERN
LEEWARD ISLANDS AS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH IN FACT
IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL.

LONG RANGE MODELS ARE DEVELOPING A LARGE TROUGH ALONG EAST COAST OF
THE UNITED STATES.  IF THIS VERFIES...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL TAKE
A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC.

11 PM EDT THU JUL 30 1998
 
ALEX IS GENERATING A CENTRAL AREA OF INTENSE CONVECTION WITH A
FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL HIGH-LEVEL OUTFLOW.  AT AN INTERMEDIATE
LEVEL...HOWEVER...THERE REMAINS A DISTINCT SSW CURRENT ACROSS THE
STORM ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AHEAD OF THE STORM.  THIS IS
JUST ONE PART OF A COMPLICATED CIRCULATION ALOFT THAT INCLUDES A
WELL-DEFINED VORTEX SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO
THE NORTHWEST OF ALEX.  THE AVN MODEL SHOWS THAT VORTEX AT 300-500
MB.  

THE INTENSE OUTFLOW AT CIRRUS LEVEL HAS OBSCURED THE CENTRAL
FEATURES...MAKING POSITIONING SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULT.  ANALYSES
FROM TAFB...SAB..AND AFWA...HOWEVER...INDICATE THAT A HEADING TOWARD
THE WNW HAS BEGUN...PERHAPS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOW DEEP ENOUGH TO
RESPOND MORE TO THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW IN ITS ENVIRONMENT.  THE MOTION
IS ESTIMATED AT 290/11 KT.  WIND SPEED IS NEAR 45 KT.
 
THE PATTERN ALOFT IS FORECAST TO REMAIN COMPLEX...WITH THE AVN
KEEPING A VORTEX TO THE NW-N OF ALEX THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS
IS INTERPRETED AS A GENERAL WEAKNESS IN THE HEIGHT PATTERN THAT
SHOULD ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN THE NORTHWARD COMPONENT.  THE
RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE FEATURES WILL PROBABLY INFLUENCE HOW
SMOOTH THE TRANSITION IN TRACK WILL BE.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS
LITTLE DIVERSITY.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NEAR THE CENTER OF THE
CLUSTER OF MODEL TRACKS AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE 18 AVN AND 12Z
NOGAPS FORECASTS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS 6 HOURS AGO.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON INFRARED IMAGERY AS A LARGE
CDO TYPE FEATURE IS OBSCURING THE LOWER CLOUDS.  TAFB AND SAB ARE
OVER 60 NMI APART IN THEIR 0545Z POSITION ESTIMATES.  THE OFFICIAL
INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION...290/11...MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE POSITION IS NEAR THE SOUTHWEST EDGE OF THE
DEEP CONVECTION SUGGESTING SOME SOUTHERLY VERTICAL SHEAR.  IF THE
CENTER IS ACTUALLY EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION...ALEX COULD
BE STRONGER THAN WE ARE ESTIMATING AND ALSO MOVING WITH MORE OF A
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.

THE TRACK MODELS ARE ALL CLOSELY CLUSTERED AND SHOW A MOSTLY
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS...MOVING INTO A WEAKNESS
IN THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE AND IS SIMILAR AND AN UPDATE TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.

THE INITIAL AND FORECAST INTENSITY ARE THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS

RELOCATED TO THE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS POSITION.  GLOBAL MODELS ARE

PERSIST FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME...AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RELAX
UNTIL 72 HOURS.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS 45 KNOTS AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR NO CHANGE AT THIS TIME. MOREOVER... WEAKENING MAY
BE INDICATED IN THE NEXT ADVISORY IF THIS TREND CONTINUES.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 270/10.  THE STEERING PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED AND
IF ALEX SURVIVES...IT IS EXPECTED TO TURN MORE TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST AS INDICATED BY MOST OF THE MODELS.  IF ALEX
BECOMES COMPLETELY EXPOSED AND WEAKENS FURTHER... THE SYSTEM COULD
MOVE MORE TO THE WEST.  HOWEVER...UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES HAVE BECOME

YESTERDAY...WE FORECAST THAT ALEX WAS GOING TO REACH HURRICANE
STATUS IN ABOUT 48 HOURS.  INSTEAD...STRONG SOUTHERLY UPPER-LEVEL
WINDS HIT THE STORM REMOVING MOST OF THE CONVECTION FROM THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER AND CONSEQUENTLY...WEAKENING HAS OCCURRED.  THIS
WEAKENING WAS NOT INDICATED BY ANY OF THE AVAILABLE TOOLS AND
REFLECTS HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT FORECASTING INTENSITY CHANGES.
AFTER THE FACT....IT IS SOMETIMES EASY TO FIND AN EXPLANATION.

IT APPEARS THAT THE WIND SHEAR WILL PERSIST SO WEAKENING SHOULD
CONTINUE AND ALEX COULD BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION
TONIGHT OR SATURDAY.   INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 35
KNOTS AND WINDS ARE KEPT AT 30 KNOTS THROUGH 72 HOURS.  

NOW THAT WE CAN SEE THE LOW LEVEL CENTER...WE HAVE A BETTER ESTIMATE
OF THE INITIAL MOTION WHICH IS 280/10.  A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED OF WHATEVER IS LEFT OF ALEX.
HOWEVER...IF IT BECOMES AN OPEN WAVE THE SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY
PROPAGATE WESTWARD SPREADING SHOWERS AND SQUALLS.

ALEX IS STILL GENERATING A FEW CLUSTERS OF DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE
NORTHERN PART OF ITS CIRCULATION AND...AS SUGGESTED BY DVORAK
TECHNIQUE ANALYSES...THE SYSTEM IS PROBABLY STILL A TROPICAL STORM.
ESTIMATED WINDS ARE 35 KT.  DATA FROM THE NOAA HIGH-ALTITUDE JET
SEEMS TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL SHEARING
PATTERN MAINLY BELOW ALEX/S CIRRUS CANOPY LEVEL.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/11 KT.  TRACK FORECASTING BECOMES MORE
DIFFICULT THAN USUAL WHEN...LIKE NOW...IT IS ALSO TIED TO A HIGHLY
UNCERTAIN INTENSITY FORECAST.  THERE APPEAR TO BE THREE PRIMARY
POSSIBILITIES.  FIRST...IF THE SHEAR SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTEDLY DECREASES
THEN ALEX COULD STRENGTHEN AND TURN MORE TOWARD THE WNW OR NW...
DIMINISHING ANY THREAT TO THE CARIBBEAN.  SECOND...ALEX COULD WEAKEN
FURTHER OR DISSIPATE WITH ITS REMNANTS MOVING NEARLY WESTWARD...
AGAIN HAVING MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE CARIBBEAN.  THIRD...THE SYSTEM
COULD REMAIN MUCH AS IT IS...UNIMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE PICTURES...
BUT A POTENTIAL PRODUCER OF SOME HEAVY RAIN AND THE POSSIBILITY OF
LOCAL FLOODING AND HIGH WIND GUSTS FOR THE LEEWARD ISLANDS HAVING
HIGH TERRAIN.
 
WITH SHEAR EXPECTED TO PERSIST...THE SECOND SCENARIO MIGHT BE THE
MOST LIKELY.  HOWEVER...PARTLY TO BE CAUTIONS...THE CURRENT FORECAST
HAS A LITTLE MORE OF AN INKLING OF THE THIRD POSSIBILITY THAN WE
HAVE INDICATED PREVIOUSLY.  THE TRACK IS SHIFTED TO THE LEFT A
LITTLE AND IF THIS TREND IS OBSERVED OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS
...SOME CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO ISSUING A TROPICAL
STORM WATCH OR WARNING FOR A PORTION OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS ON
SATURDAY.  THE NHC TRACK IS BETWEEN BAMS AND CLIPER...WHICH FORM THE

MAINTAINED AS A MINIMUM TROPICAL STORM...35 KNOTS... FOR THIS

IN ITS WEAKEN STATE ALEX/S MOTION IS BEING CONTROLLED BY LOW-LEVEL
TROPOSPHERIC STEERING...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 275/12
KNOTS.  AS STATED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY THE TRACK AND INTENSITY
FORECASTS FOR ALEX ARE INTERTWINED. DATA FROM THE G-IV HIGH-ALTITUDE
JET AIRCRAFT MISSION FRIDAY AFTERNOON REVEALED 30-40 KNOT SOUTH/
SOUTHWEST WINDS BETWEEN 200 AND 250 MB IN THE VICINITY OF THE
SYSTEM.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW ABOUT
11 DEG NW OF ALEX HELPING TO BACK THE FLOW OVER THE EASTERN
CARIBBEAN.  SO...THE SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST.  IF THE SHEAR DID RELAX ALEX COULD STRENGTHEN
AND TURN MORE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST... AND MOST OF THE TRACK
MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS THIS SCENARIO.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A LESS
PLAUSIBLE POSSIBILITY.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING THROUGH
24 HOURS WITH A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST THEN NORTHWEST TRACK THEREAFTER.

THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS IN CLOSE
AGREEMENT WITH BAM SHALLOW.  WITH THE VERTICAL WIND SHEAR EXPECTED

STORM FORCE WINDS WERE OBSERVED BY THE FLIGHT CREW...BUT ONLY IN THE
THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS NORTH OF THE NOW ALMOST ENTIRELY EXPOSED
LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  THE SUSTAINED WINDS ARE LIKELY NOW AT MOST 45 KT. 
INITIAL MOTION IS NEAR 300/13 KT.
 
THE FUTURE TRACK AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALEX ARE COMPLICATED BY A
FRACTURED CIRCULATION PATTERN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WITH
ANOTHER LOW-LEVEL VORTEX TO THE WNW OF ALEX AND WITH SOME MODELS
INDICATING THAT YET ANOTHER LOW WILL DEVELOP FROM THE BAROCLINIC
ZONE ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST.  ALOFT...A LARGE AND PERSISTENT
CYCLONIC CIRCULATION IS NOTED.  REMARKABLY...THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS
RELATIVELY UNIFORM...SUGGESTING A WNW TO NW TRACK THROUGH 48 HOURS. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THOSE TRACKS AND
SIMILAR TO THE GFDL.
  
ALEX/S INTENSITY WILL BE PARTLY A FUNCTION OF HOW IT NEGOTIATES A
TRACK AROUND...OR THROUGH...THE UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATION. 
WITHOUT HAVING A GOOD HANDLE ON HOW THAT INTERACTION WILL PLAY
OUT...THE CURRENT FORECAST WILL SHOW NO CHANGE IN WIND SPEED.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
STORM.  ALEX REMAINS IN A SHEARED STATE WITH THE CENTER LOCATED TO
THE SOUTH OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN
UPPER LEVEL LOW NEAR 25N64W WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SOUTH-
SOUTHWESTERLY SHEARING.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THE
SYSTEM HAS DROPPED BELOW STORM STRENGTH...BUT WE WILL WAIT FOR THE
AIR FORCE RECON LATER TODAY TO CONFIRM THIS.  SINCE THERE IS STILL A
SLIM POSSIBILITY THAT UPPER-LEVEL CONDITIONS COULD BECOME LESS
HOSTILE FOR STRENGTHENING...AS INDICATED BY MODELS SUCH AS THE
STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS THE WINDS AT 35 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

ALEX HAS TURNED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT AND IS NOW MOVING AT AN
ESTIMATED 310/11.  THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST IS TO THE RIGHT OF
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND NEAR THE CONSENSUS OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACKS. 
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB LOW NEAR THE SOUTH CAROLINA
COAST WITH A HIGH CENTERED JUST EAST OF BERMUDA IN 2-3 DAYS.  THIS
SUPPORTS A CONTINUED NORTHWESTWARD...PERHAPS MORE NORTH-
NORTHWESTWARD... MOVEMENT OF ALEX.

THE STRONG TROPICAL WAVE TO THE EAST OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS HAS
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY...AS THE CLOUD PATTERN BECAME MORE
CONSOLIDATED OVER THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE SYSTEM.  LOW CLOUD
MOTIONS AND SHIP REPORTS SHOW A CLOSED SURFACE CIRCULATION WHICH IS
SOMEWHAT ELONGATED ALONG A NORTHWEST-SOUTHEAST AXIS.   UPPER-LEVEL
WINDS...SUCH AS THOSE ANALYZED BY THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES ON THE INTERNET...APPEAR MOSTLY
FAVORABLE OVER THE AREA...ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION OF
SLIGHT SOUTHERLY SHEAR OVER THE DEPRESSION.  THE STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...INDICATES STEADY
STRENGTHENING...BUT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT MORE
CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE OF THE CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN INTENSITY
FORECASTING. 

THE CURRENT POSITION...WHICH SUGGESTS A MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION
COMPARED TO THE EARLIER CENTER FIXES...PARTIALLY REPRESENTS A
REFORMATION OF THE CENTER AS THE CYCLONE ORGANIZES.  OUR BEST
INITIAL MOVEMENT ESTIMATE IS 295/17 AND OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE IS IN
REASONABLE AGREEMENT ON A CONTINUATION OF THIS MOTION FOR THE NEXT
FEW DAYS.  THIS LOOKS REASONABLE SINCE THE NUMERICAL MODELS ALSO
SHOW A MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.

LAST LIGHT VISIBLE PICTURES SUGGESTED THAT THE CENTER REMAINS BROAD

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER POSITION IS JUST SOUTHEAST OF A CURRENT BURST
OF DEEP CONVECTION.  THE CENTER MAY BE TRYING TO RE-DEVELOP CLOSER

AGREEMENT...ALTHOUGH THE USUAL UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH INFRARED

GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS
BEEN ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND

DEEP CONVECTION IS GRADUALLY BECOMING MORE CONCENTRATED NEAR THE
ESTIMATED CIRCULATION CENTER AND DIMINISHING ALONG THE PREVIOUSLY
NOTED AXIS EXTENDING TOWARD THE SE.  WHILE THIS IMPLIES AN IMPROVING
ORGANIZATION...DVORAK T-NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN AT
2.0...JUST BELOW TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR IS
OFTEN THE NEMESIS OF ATLANTIC TROPICAL CYCLONES.  IN THIS CASE...THE
SYSTEM HAS A REMARKABLY PROMINENT OUTFLOW ALOFT WITH...IF ANYTHING
...SOUTHEASTERLY SHEAR.  THE FORECAST ENVIRONMENT AHEAD IS FAVORABLE
FOR STRENGTHENING AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE NHC FORECAST WHICH
SHOWS AN INTENSIFICATION RATE APPROXIMATING THAT OF THE SHIP/S
SCHEME.
 
THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH IS EXPECTED TO KEEP THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE ON A WNW HEADING FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS WITH THE STRONG
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH NOW ALONG THE EAST COAST SWINGING OFFSHORE AND
LIKELY BYPASSING THE SYSTEM.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE AND OFFICIAL
FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY ARE BASED ON THIS SEQUENCE.
 
BEGINNING AROUND 48 HOURS...THE LARGE-SCALE MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE
MARKEDLY.  WHEN A SECOND SHORT-WAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE
COAST...THE 00Z AVN AND NOGAPS TURN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE NORTHWARD
AROUND THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE HIGH...BETWEEN 66-70W.  THIS IS
SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS RUNS FROM THOSE MODELS.  THE GFDL...ON THE OTHER
HAND...MAINTAINS A MID-LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDING WESTWARD FROM THE HIGH
TO THE GULF OF MEXICO BETWEEN 25-30N.  THIS KEEPS THE SYSTEM ON A
WNW TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS...ENDING UP SOME 500 NM SOUTHWEST OF THE
OTHER GUIDANCE.  THIS GFDL TRACK IS A LITTLE NORTH OF ITS TRACK 6
HOURS AGO.  THE NHC TRACK IS NORTH OF THE GFDL...ON THE SOUTHERN
EDGE OF THE REMAINING GUIDANCE...AND CLOSE TO OUR PREVIOUS TRACKS.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE DEPRESSION IS FAIRLY WELL
ORGANIZED...AND MAY BE A TROPICAL STORM.  WE WILL AWAIT THE AIR
FORCE RECON OBSERVATIONS LATER TODAY TO SEE IF WE SHOULD NAME THE
SYSTEM.  THE ANTICYLONIC OUTFLOW IS VERY IMPRESSIVE OVER THE
NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE AND RAWINSONDE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE
NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN SHOW NO HIGH LEVEL WESTERLIES TO IMPEDE
DEVELOPMENT.  SO...STRENGTHENING IS PREDICTED AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.
 
THE CYCLONE WAS APPARENTLY MOVING FASTER OVERNIGHT THAN EARLIER
REPORTED AND HAS BEEN RELOCATED FARTHER TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST.
MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 290/20.  THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A BROAD
TROUGH AT 500 MB MOVING OFF THE NORTHEAST U.S. COAST IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS AND THIS SHOULD PARTIALLY BREAK DOWN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OVER
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  CONSEQUENTLY MOST OF THE TRACK PREDICTION
MODELS TURN THE CYCLONE TO THE NORTHWEST AND SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED
LATER IN THE PERIOD...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  HOWEVER WE ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORE WESTWARD TRACK SINCE THE
STATE-OF-THE-ART  GFDL MODEL DOES NOT SHOW MUCH OF A NORTHWARD
TREND.
 
THE NOAA G-4 JET AND BOTH NOAA P-3 PLANES WILL FLY A SYNOPTIC

THE HURRICANE HUNTERS FOUND FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS TO 61 KNOTS TO THE

UPGRADING T.D. TWO TO TROPICAL STORM BONNIE. ALTHOUGH THE STORM HAS
A WELL-ORGANIZED APPEARANCE IN SATELLITE IMAGERY...ITS RAPID FORWARD
TRANSLATIONAL SPEED IS APPARENTLY DISTORTING THE WIND FIELD NEAR THE
CENTER.  THE ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT REMAINS FAVORABLE FOR CONTINUED
STRENGTHENING AND INTENSIFICATION IS EVEN MORE LIKELY IF THE FORWARD
SPEED SLOWS SOMEWHAT...AS FORECAST.
 
BONNIE HAS BEEN TRACKING SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST TODAY...BUT
PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS EXCEPT THE GFDL SHOW
A SIGNIFICANT TURN TO THE RIGHT.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH A
BREAKDOWN OF THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AS
SHOWN BY THE GLOBAL MODELS.  NOTWITHSTANDING...OUT OF RESPECT FOR
WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE OUR MOST RELIABLE GUIDANCE...THE GFDL...WE
ARE KEEPING THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE
ENSEMBLE.
 
SINCE THE FORECAST TRACK IS RATHER CLOSE TO THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND
PUERTO RICO...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS AND WATCHES HAVE BEEN ISSUED
FOR THESE AREAS.  HOWEVER AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT THE STRONG
WINDS ARE RESTRICTED MAINLY TO THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE OF BONNIE.

WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE RECON IN THE AREA UNTIL OOZ TONIGHT.
EARLIER FIXES INDICATE THAT BONNIE HAS BEEN MOVING ABOUT 290/15.
MINIMUM PRESSURE IS ESTIMATED AT 999 MB.  SATELLITE SUGGESTS THAT
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED WITH
DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND EXCELLENT OUTFLOW. BOTH SHIPS
AND THE GFDL SUGGEST THAT BONNIE COULD REACH 100 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS
AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.
 
THE BIG DILEMMA IS WHETHER OR NOT THE TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO
DEVELOP ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL
STEER BONNIE NORTHWARD.  IN ANY CASE THE STEERING FLOW IS FORECAST
TO WEAKEN WHICH WOULD SLOW BONNIE DOWN. NOGAPS BRINGS BONNIE CLOSER
TO THE COAST THAN IN PREVIOUS RUNS IN THE MEDIUM RANGE AND THE
LATEST GFDL MAINTAINS A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...AS IN PREVIOUS FORECAST...CONTINUES VERY CLOSE TO THE

BONNIE CONTINUES TO LOOK STRONGER ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...WITH A VERY
COLD TOPPED CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST AND INCREASED BANDING FEATURES
OVER THE NORTH AND WEST QUADRANTS.  RECON RECENTLY FOUND A 991 MB
CENTRAL PRESSURE AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 60 KNOTS.
THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW STILL LOOKS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  BONNIE COULD BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE
WITHIN THIS FORECAST PERIOD.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/15.  THE DYNAMICAL MODELS INDICATE
THAT THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF BONNIE WILL BREAK DOWN
LATER IN THIS FORECAST PERIOD WHICH SHOULD SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED
AND EVENTUALLY RESULT IN A MORE NORTHWARD TRACK.  THE TIMING OF THIS
NORTHWARD MOTION...OF COURSE...IS CRITICAL.  OUR CURRENT TRACK LEANS
TOWARD THE LEFT OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE AND IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH
THE GFDL.  IT IS NOTED THAT THE UKMET...NAVY NOGAPS...AND AVN ARE
CONSISTENTLY TO THE RIGHT OF OUR TRACK.
 
BONNIE COULD STILL BE A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE EAST U.S. COAST
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  WE ARE INSERTING A STATEMENT TO THE
EFFECT ...RESIDENTS WITHIN THIS AREA SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
BONNIE AT THIS TIME.
 
THE NOAA HIGH ALTITUDE JET AND BOTH NOAA P3 AIRCRAFT ARE FLYING A

ON THEIR LAST PASS THROUGH BONNIE NEAR 0530Z...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS
FOUND THAT A NEARLY COMPLETE EYEWALL HAD FORMED.  THEY ALSO REPORTED
A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 987 MB WITH FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 76 KT.
SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT 65 KT.  THE
MOTION HAS EDGED OVER TO 300 DEGREES...STILL AT 15 KNOTS.
 
NOAA AIRCRAFT HAVE ONCE AGAIN PROVIDED THE NUMERICAL MODELS NUMEROUS
VERTICAL SOUNDINGS OF BONNIE/S ENVIRONMENT TO IMPROVE FORECASTS OF
TRACK AND INTENSITY.  THE RESULTING GUIDANCE AND OUR CONCERNS ARE
LITTLE CHANGED.  THE LARGE-SCALE MODELS SHOW A WEAKENING OF STEERING
CURRENTS DURING THE NEXT TWO DAYS...FOLLOWED BY THE APPROACH OF A
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES WHICH COULD INDUCE A GREATER
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS SIMILAR TO 6
HOURS AGO SHOWING A GRADUAL TURN FROM WNW TO NW AND DECELERATION
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  THE GFDL TRACK AGAIN FORMS THE LEFT EDGE OF
THE ENSEMBLE...BUT ALL THE GFDL 72-HOUR FORECAST POSITIONS FOR
BONNIE HAVE ENDED UP LEFT OF THE ACTUAL TRACK.  THE NHC FORECAST IS
TO THE RIGHT OF GFDL...NEAR LBAR WHICH HAS HAD LITTLE LATERAL
BIAS...AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS TRACK.
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BAHAMAS HAS ISSUED A HURRICANE WARNING FOR THE

FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT BONNIE
IS RIGHT ON TRACK...300/14.  THERE IS NO APPARENT CHANGE IN THE BOTH
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING BONNIE.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE LOCATED
TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE HURRICANE WILL DRIVE THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE THAT THE RIDGE WILL WEAKEN...
ALLOWING BONNIE TO TURN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH. THE GFDL
MAKES A MORE GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST WITH A DECREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONTINUES VERY CLOSE TO THE
GFDL BUT REFLECTING THE CONSENSUS FOR A MORE NORTHWARD TURN BEYOND
36 HOURS.
 
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DROPPED TO 980 MB SUGGESTING THAT
STRENGTHENING IS OCCURRING. SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD

ALL CURRENT AVAILABLE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT BONNIE SHOULD TURN MORE
TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.
THIS TURN IS ALSO FORECAST BY OUR STATE OF THE ART GFDL MODEL. THIS
LESSENS ANY POSSIBLE THREAT OF LANDFALL IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA.
HOWEVER...ONE SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
BONNIE UNTIL THE EXPECTED TURN MATERIALIZES.  ON THE OTHER
HAND...THE POTENTIAL THREAT FROM CENTRAL FLORIDA NORTHWARD ALONG THE
EAST COAST REMAINS. 

BONNIE HAS SLOWED DOWN...AS FORECAST BY THE GFDL...AND THE INITIAL
MOTION IS 300/11.  THERE IS ENOUGH RIDGING TO THE NORTH TO MAINTAIN
THIS GENERAL TRACK THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A SLOW
TURN TO THE NORTHWEST IS FORECAST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AGAIN
VERY CLOSE TO THE GFDL AND BIT TO THE LEFT OF THE OTHER MODELS. 

NOTE: LATEST NOGAPS KEEPS THE HURRICANE ON A GENERAL NORTHWEST TO
NORTH-NORTHWEST TRACK AND BRINGS THE CENTER OF BONNIE NEAR THE SOUTH
CAROLINA COAST BY EARLY WEDNESDAY. THIS IS ALSO INDICATED BY THE
MEDIUM RANGE VERSION OF THE GFDL.  

LATEST RECON DATA SHOWS THAT THE WINDS ARE 80 KNOTS AND MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE REMAINS AT 977 MB. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAKES
BONNIE A CATEGORY 3 ON THE SAFFIR SIMPSON-SCALE AS INDICATED IN THE

THE LAST AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 959 MB...A 3 MB DECREASE SINCE 03Z AND AN 18 MB FALL IN
THE LAST 10 HOURS...AND A 25 NMI CIRCULAR EYE.  THE FLIGHT-LEVEL
WINDS HAVE NOW INCREASED WITH A MAXIMUM WIND OF 102 KNOTS RECORDED
IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 
90 KNOTS.  THE SATELLITE PRESENTATION REMAINS IMPRESSIVE WITH A
SYMMETRIC RING OF -75C TOPS SURROUNDING THE EYE AND EXCELLENT
OUTFLOW.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR FURTHER STRENGTHENING
ALONG THE LINES OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

RECONNAISSANCE POSITION FIXES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS INDICATE
THAT THE MOTION OF BONNIE HAS BEEN SLOW AND ERRATIC.  THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE BASED ON THE LAST 6 HOURS IS 310/06 KNOTS.  AS HAS
BEEN THE CASE IN THE LAST SEVERAL ADVISORIES...THE FUTURE TRACK OF
BONNIE IS HINGED ON THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RIDGE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM. 
THE SYSTEM SHOULD TURN MORE TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST AND NORTH DURING
THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS...STEERED...IN PART...AROUND THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE TO THE EAST.  A TROUGH
CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL U.S. IS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE
NORTHEAST U.S. IN THE NEXT 36 TO 48 HOURS WHICH MAY HELP TURN BONNIE
MORE NORTHWARD.  THE AVIATION SHOWS THIS TROUGH MOVING FAR ENOUGH
SOUTH TO PULL BONNIE NORTH WHILE THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL INDICATES
THAT THE TROUGH STAYS SUFFICIENTLY NORTH TO ALLOW A MORE NORTHWEST
MOTION.  

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
AND IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL...AND SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE
UKMET.   NOGAPS MODEL IS THE LEFT-MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.   ALTHOUGH
THIS TRACK LESSENS THE THREAT OF LANDFALL IN FLORIDA...INTERESTS IN

11 AM EDT SUN AUG 23 1998

EVEN THOUGH THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW TO THE WEST IS CURRENTLY BEING
IMPEDED A BIT...BONNIE HAS CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN.  A HURRICANE
HUNTER PLANE IS FINDING WINDS OF AT LEAST 100 KNOTS AT THE 700 MB
LEVEL...AND WINDS AT 850 MB ARE PROBABLY HIGHER.  ON SATELLITE...
BONNIE HAS A CLASSICAL APPEARENCE.  THE COLD-TOPPED DENSE OVERCAST
SURROUNDING THE EYE HAS GROWN IN SIZE.  CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE
IS 100 KNOTS...MAKING BONNIE A MAJOR HURRICANE.  SOME FURTHER
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR.  

RECON AND SATELLITE FIXES YIELD LITTLE MOTION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
HOURS...SO THE GUIDANCE MODELS WERE INITIALIZED WITH A FORWARD
MOTION OF ZERO.  THE RESULTING OBJECTIVE TRACK FORECASTS ARE HIGHLY
DIVERGENT...WITH 72 HOUR PREDICTIONS RANGING FROM NEAR THE CAROLINA
COAST TO WELL OFFSHORE OF THE U.S. EAST COAST.  THE STEERING PATTERN
IS BY NO MEANS STRAIGHTFORWARD.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THAT A
WEAK MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS CURRENTLY IN THE VICINITY OF
BONNIE... AND HAS PROBABLY CAUSED THE STALLING OF THE HURRICANE.  IT
APPEARS THAT THIS TROUGH WILL BYPASS BONNIE...THEREFORE A SLOW
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION IS FORECAST TO RESUME.   WATER VAPOR WINDS FROM
THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS SUGGESTS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE
EXTENDING EASTWARD FROM NEAR THE FLORIDA-GEORGIA BORDER INTO THE
ATLANTIC FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES...AND THIS COULD PREVENT A TURN
AWAY FROM THE COAST IF IT PERSISTS.  THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER
ANOTHER UPSTREAM TROUGH...CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTH-CENTRAL U.S.
...WILL EVENTUALLY PULL BONNIE AWAY FROM THE COAST.  ALL INTERESTS
ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. SHOULD MAINTAIN THEIR VIGILANCE AND
MONITOR FUTURE ADVISORIES. 

ANOTHER MULTI-AIRCRAFT MISSION INVOLVING AIRCRAFT FROM BOTH NOAA AND
NASA WILL PROVIDE EXTENSIVE SAMPLING OF THE STEERING ENVIRONMENT
TODAY.  THEIR DATA SHOULD HELP IMPROVE THE INITIALIZATION AND BRING

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SUN AUG 23 1998

AFTER DRIFTING TO THE NORTH EARLIER TODAY...BONNIE APPEARS TO NOW BE
MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWESTWARD.  THE INFLUENCE OF THE MID- TO UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH...THAT LIKELY INDUCED THE NORTHWARD NUDGE OF THE
HURRICANE...NOW APPEARS TO BE LESSENING AS IT BY PASSES BONNIE.  WE
ARE NOW FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF THE FUTURE COURSE OF THIS
HURRICANE.  THE PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT SOME OF OUR
BEST TRACK PREDICTION MODELS HAVE SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE LEFT
AS COMPARED TO THIS MORNING.  LOOKING AT SOME OF THE MODEL
FIELDS...THERE IS NOW A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT BONNIE COULD BE
TRAPPED BENEATH A NARROW RIDGE ALONG ABOUT 36N LATITUDE OR SO.  IF
THIS IS THE CASE...BONNIE COULD REACH THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST NEAR
THE END OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.

THE EYE HAS BECOME INDISTINCT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.  SINCE BONNIE
HAS BEEN DWELLING OVER THE SAME GENERAL AREA MOST OF TODAY...IT MAY
HAVE COOLED THE SURFACE WATERS UNDERNEATH IT AND THIS MAY HAVE
TEMPORARILY BRAKED THE STRENGTHENING TREND.  ANOTHER INHIBITING
FACTOR MAY HAVE THE ABOVEMENTIONED TROUGH.  HOWEVER THE HURRICANE
HAS A MASSIVE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW OVER ALL BUT THE
NORTHWEST QUADRANT.  ALSO...THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DIURNAL
FLUCTUATIONS WHEREIN THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN STRENGTHENING MORE DURING
THE NIGHTTIME HOURS THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...AND BECOMING A LITTLE
LESS ORGANIZED AROUND MIDDAY.  SOME FURTHER INCREASE IN INTENSITY IS
CERTAINLY POSSIBLE DURING THE PERIOD.

ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. SHOULD MAINTAIN THEIR
VIGILANCE AND MONITOR FUTURE ADVISORIES.  WE HAVE INSERTED A
STATEMENT INTO THE ADVISORY THAT A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE REQUIRED
FOR A PORTION OF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST ON MONDAY
 
ANOTHER MULTI-AIRCRAFT MISSION INVOLVING AIRCRAFT FROM BOTH NOAA AND

AIR FORCE RESERVE AIRCRAFT FIXES SHOW THAT THE MOTION IS STILL SLOW
AND ERRATIC.  THE PAST 12 HOUR MOTION IS 320/04 AND THIS WILL BE
USED AS THE INITIAL MOTION.
 
THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS FASCINATING.  THE GFDL MODEL HAS CHANGED
DRAMATICALLY FROM THE PREVIOUS RUN.  INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SOUTH
CAROLINA IN 72 HOURS...THE LATEST RUN...BASED ON EXCELLENT DATA FROM
A MULTI AIRCRAFT MISSION TO INITIALIZE THE 00Z ANALYSIS...SHOWS
THE NARROW RIDGE TO THE NORTH BREAKING DOWN AND BONNIE ACCELERATING
NORTH NORTHWESTWARD AND THEN RECURVING NORTHEASTWARD AND STAYING
OFFSHORE OF THE OUTER BANKS BY 100 MILES.  IN CONTRAST THE NOGAPS
AND UKMET MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A SLOW NORTHWEST MOTION TOWARD
GEORGIA OR SOUTH CAROLINA.  MY FORECAST TRACK IS A COMPROMISE WHICH
PUTS THE CENTER ON THE SOUTHERN COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA IN 72 HOURS.
THIS IS A STRATEGY OF LEAST REGRET...SO THAT INTERESTS ALONG THE

REPORTED USING GPS SONDS DURING THE LATEST MISSION WAS 94 KNOTS IN

HURRICANE BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  20
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON AUG 24 1998

LATEST RECON FIX SHOWS LITTLE MOVEMENT...AGAIN.  WE STILL EXPECT A
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION TO RESUME BUT THE STEERING CURRENTS ARE STILL
VERY WEAK IN THE AREA.  LAST NIGHT...THE 00Z GFDL MODEL RUN MADE A
DRASTIC CHANGE...SHIFTING THE FORECAST TRACK TO THE EAST...AND THE
06Z RUN OF THIS MODEL TELLS ABOUT THE SAME STORY.  THE 06Z AVN RUN
OF THE NCEP GLOBAL SPECTRAL MODEL SHOWS THAT THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE HAS ENOUGH OF A BREAK IN THE VICINITY OF EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA TO ALLOW BONNIE TO SLIP THROUGH AND INDEED MANY OF THE
TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS NOW SHOW RECURVATURE AWAY FROM THE COAST. 
HOWEVER THE 00Z NAVY NOGAPS MODEL REFUSES TO RECURVE BONNY...AND
BRINGS THE CYCLONE CLOSE TO THE GEORGIA/FLORIDA BORDER BY THE END OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  INTERESTINGLY...IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT 80 PER
CENT OF THE DROPWINDSONDES FROM YESTERDAYS MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL
SAMPLING MISSION ENTERED INTO THAT MODEL SO IT CANNOT BE
DISREGARDED.  ANOTHER COMPLICATING FACTOR IS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH THAT WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS DROPPING INTO THE NORTH-
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.  THIS FEATURE COULD EXERT SOME INFLUENCE ON
THE FUTURE TRACK OF BONNIE AS WELL.

INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS NEAR 100 KNOTS.  EVEN THOUGH THE EYE HAS
DISAPPEARED...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS REPORTED 109 KNOT WINDS NEAR THE
700 MB LEVEL.  IF BONNIE MOVES A BIT MORE...IT WOULD LIKELY
ENCOUNTER WARMER WATERS AND THIS COULD ALLOW STRENGTHENING.  HOWEVER
THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION OF SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR....PARTICULARLY IN
THE AVN MODEL OUTPUT...SO THIS COULD NEGATE STRENGTHENING.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST HOLDS THE WINDS AT 100 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON AUG 24 1998
 
A SLOW MOTION TOWARD THE NORTHWEST IS EVIDENT...ESTIMATED TO BE
325/05.  OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE IS...SHALL I SAY...DIVERGENT.  AT 72
HOURS THERE IS NEARLY A 1200 N MI SPREAD BETWEEN THE MEDIUM
BAM...NEAR THE GEORGIA COAST...AND THE GFDL WHICH RECURVES BONNIE
OUT TO SEA.  THE 12Z AVN SHOWS A 500 MB SHORTWAVE NEARING THE
NORTHEASTERN U.S. IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...BREAKING DOWN THE RIDGE NEAR
MID-ATLANTIC COAST AND ALLOWING BONNIE TO RECURVE OFFSHORE OF THE
NORTH CAROLINA OUTER BANKS.  HOWEVER THE NOGAPS AND U.K. MET. OFFICE
GLOBAL MODELS COMPLICATE THE FORECAST SINCE THEY DO NOT RECURVE THE
HURRICANE AND TAKE IT NEAR TO..OR ACROSS...THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST.
SINCE THE LATTER TWO MODELS ARE RESPECTABLE ONES...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS STILL NOT COMMITTED TO A RECURVATURE.  WITH SUCH DIVERSE
GUIDANCE...OBVIOUSLY OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE 72 HOUR POINT IS NOT THAT
HIGH.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK COUPLED WITH THE LARGE SIZE OF BONNIE...TROPICAL
STORM FORCE WINDS EXTENDING 200 NM OVER THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT...
DICTATE THE ISSUANCE OF A HURRICANE WATCH FOR A PORTION OF THE U.S.
SOUTHEAST COAST.  STRONG WINDS ARE POSSIBLE ON THE COAST IN 36 HOURS
OR LESS.
 
INTENSITY REMAINS UNCHANGED...NEAR 100 KNOTS.  EVEN THOUGH BONNIE
APPEARS TO BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF MODEST WESTERLY SHEAR...THE
HURRICANE HAS SUCH A LARGE AND POWERFUL CIRCULATION SO AS TO BE
RESILIENT TO THE SHEARING.  ALSO...THE HURRICANE WILL LIKELY MOVE
OVER SLIGHTLY WARMER WATERS DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  LITTLE
CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS PREDICTED UNTIL THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD
WHEN CONDITIONS WILL PROBABLY BECOME A LITTLE MORE HOSTILE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON AUG 24 1998
 
BONNIE LOOKS A LITTLE RAGGED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...BUT LATEST RECON
REPORTED 962 MB WHICH IS ABOUT THE SAME AS 18 HOURS AGO.  117 KNOTS
WAS REPORTED FROM ONE OF THE GPS DROPS NEAR THE 900 MB LEVEL IN THE
NORTHWEST EYEWALL.  THEREFORE...INITIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN AT 100
KNOTS.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS WILL LIKELY OCCUR...BUT WITH BONNIE YET TO
CROSS THE WARM GULF STREAM WE WILL MAINTAIN CAT THREE INTENSITY FOR
MOST OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/07.  THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE REMAINS
DIVERGENT AND THEREFORE THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS DIFFICULT.  THE
NAVY NOGAPS HAS BONNIE CENTERED NEAR THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST WHILE
THE GFDL RECURVES THE HURRICANE AND HAS IT MOVING SOUTH OF NOVA
SCOTIA BY THE END OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.  OUR CURRENT TRACK IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH
THE DEEP LAYER BAM AND THE GFDL THROUGH 36 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...
THERE IS A DECENT CHANCE THAT IT WILL BE CAUGHT UP IN THE WESTERLIES
AND RECURVE.  HOWEVER...IF THE PREDICTED INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED
DOES NOT OCCUR...THERE IS STILL A CHANCE THAT BONNIE COULD MOVE TO
THE LEFT OF OUR OFFICIAL TRACK.

5 AM EDT TUE AUG 25 1998
 
LATEST RECON FIXES SHOW A MOTION OF 330/08 OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS
COMPARED TO 325/05 12 HOURS AGO...SO THE FORWARD MOTION APPEARS TO
BE INCREASING. THE PAST 6 HOUR MOTION IS 10 KNOTS.   USING THE
MULTI-AIRCRAFT MISSION DATA AND THE 00Z AVIATION RUN...THE GFDL
MODEL SHOWS ABOUT THE SAME TRACK AS BEFORE...PASSING ABOUT 75 N.MI.
EAST OF THE OUTER BANKS IN 36 HOURS AND THEN ACCELERATING TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST.  THE UKMET SHOWS A LANDFALL IN SOUTHERN N.C. IN ABOUT 60
HOURS AND THE NOGAPS SHOWS A LANDFALL NEAR CHARLESTON IN 48
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE UKMET AND GFDL AND PUTS THE
CENTER ACROSS THE OUTER BANKS IN 36 TO 48 HOURS.
 
THE 34 KNOT WIND RADII IS ABOUT 165 N.M. IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT
BASED ON A GPS DROPSONDE.  ON THE FORECAST TRACK...GALES WILL REACH
THE N.C. COAST IN ABOUT 24 TO 30 HOURS FROM 09Z...SO IT IS TIME TO
PUT UP A HURRICANE WARNING.
 
IF THE NOGAPS TURNS OUT TO BE CORRECT...THE MOVEMENT SHOULD BE
SLOWER AND THERE WILL BE MORE TIME BEFORE WARNINGS ARE NEEDED
FURTHER SOUTH.
 
THE LAST RECON CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 963 MB AND THE 117 KNOT
FLIGHT LEVEL WIND STILL STANDS AS THE HIGHEST WIND SPEED DURING THE
LAST RECON MISSION.  LATER PASSES FAILED TO FIND A WIND NEAR THAT
VALUE...BUT SINCE THE PRESSURE REMAINS THE SAME...THE WIND SPEED
WILL BE KEPT AT 100 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST WIND SPEED IS THE SAME AS
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT TUE AUG 25 1998
 
MODEST CHANGES TO TRACK THIS MORNING CAN BE INTERPRETED IN TWO WAYS.
WHILE BONNIE HAS ACCELERATED FROM 10 KT TO ABOUT 14 KT...SUGGESTING
THAT IT WILL GET CAUGHT UP IN THE APPROACHING SHORT-WAVE TROUGH OVER
THE GREAT LAKES STATES...THE HEADING HAS STAYED ABOUT THE SAME OR
EVEN EDGED 5 DEGREES TO THE LEFT...ARGUING FOR A DELAY IN ANY TURN.
ALTERNATELY...THESE VARIATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARY. IN ANY
CASE...BONNIE IS QUICKLY APPROACHING THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA AND
ALL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE MADE NOW FOR A POWERFUL HURRICANE THERE.
 
THE TRACK GUIDANCE HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS WITH
MOST FORECASTS SUPPORTING THE CURRENT NHC TRACK WHICH IS A LITTLE
FASTER AND A BIT TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THIS
FORECAST IMPLIES THAT TROPICAL STORM WINDS WILL ARRIVE ON THE NORTH
CAROLINA AND THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST NEAR MIDNIGHT AND HURRICANE
FORCE WINDS NEAR DAWN TOMORROW.
 
WESTERLY SHEAR AND AN INFLUX OF SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR INTO THE
SOUTHWEST SECTOR HAS LED TO A MORE RAGGED APPEARANCE TO BONNIE ON
SATELLITE PICTURES.  WHILE THERE IS NO EYE APPARENT ON
SATELLITE...OR TO THE HURRICANE HUNTERS...THE RECON RECENTLY
REPORTED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 964 MB.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT...DESPITE
THE APPEARANCE...BONNIE HAS PROBABLY NOT CHANGED MUCH IN INTENSITY.
INDEED...AN EXPERIMENTAL RUN OF THE GFDL...COUPLED WITH AN OCEAN
MODEL...INDICATES THAT SOME STRENGTHENING REMAINS POSSIBLE DURING
THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

WHILE THE OVERALL MOTION REMAINS TOWARD ABOUT 325/330 DEGREES AT 14
KT...SATELLITE PICTURES CLEARLY SHOW SOME POTENTIALLY DECEPTIVE
NORTHWESTWARD WOBBLING OF THE EYE ALONG THAT TRACK.  SOME EVIDENCE
OF AN EYEWALL IS NOW SEEN IN THE IMAGERY AND THE HURRICANE HUNTERS
REPORTED AN OPEN...ELLIPTICAL SHAPE EYE BEFORE THEY DEPARTED A FEW
HOURS AGO.  THEY MEASURED FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS A LITTLE IN EXCESS OF
100 KT TWICE TODAY IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE CENTRAL PRESSURE
AT 1738Z...THE LAST FIX BEFORE ABOUT 00Z...WAS ONCE AGAIN 963 MB. 
BASED ON RECENT SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS...THE NEXT MEASURED PRESSURE
COULD BE LOWER.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 100 KT.
 
THE 12Z GUIDANCE SHOWS MUCH MORE CONSISTENCY THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
ALL DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE NOW SHOWS THE CENTER MAKING LANDFALL IN
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA OR PASSING JUST OFFSHORE. THIS IS GENERALLY
FOLLOWED BY A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST WITH ACCELERATION.  WHILE
THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE FORWARD SPEED...THE
CONSENSUS IS QUITE SIMILAR TO OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH IS CLOSELY
FOLLOWED FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS.  OUR TRACK FROM 36 TO 72 HOURS IS
OFFSET ABOUT 45 NMI TO THE RIGHT OF 6 HOURS AGO.  ALL DYNAMICAL
GUIDANCE EXCEPT NOGAPS IS EVEN FARTHER OFFSHORE...TO THE RIGHT.
THESE MODEST CHANGES ARE BASED ON THE EXPECTATION THAT THE
APPROACHING SHORT-WAVE TROUGHS WILL TURN BONNIE TO THE NORTH LATER
TONIGHT AND THEN ACCELERATE IT NORTHEASTWARD BY THURSDAY.

THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING FROM CAPE ROMAIN TO MURRELLS INLET IS
CHANGED TO A HURRICANE WARNING ON THIS ADVISORY.

HURRICANE BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  28
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT TUE AUG 25 1998
 
FORWARD SPEED APPEARS TO HAVE SLOWED JUST A BIT...TO NEAR 12 KNOTS.
OTHERWISE THE TRACK IS ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE...AND ALL OF OUR
GUIDANCE...ASIDE FROM SHALLOW LAYER STEERING WHICH IS NOT VALID FOR
A HURRICANE...SHOW A TURN TO THE NORTH BY MORNING.  SO...VERY LITTLE
CHANGE IS MADE FROM THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST.  IN FACT...THE
SLIGHT SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED MAY BE PRESAGING A CHANGE IN
DIRECTION.  A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS APPROACHING
THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND THIS FEATURE SHOULD BRING ABOUT THE
EXPECTED TURN TO THE RIGHT.  IN 24 TO 36 HOURS BONNIE IS EXPECTED TO
BE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD WITH AN ACCELERATING FORWARD SPEED.
 
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE NORTHWARD TURN HAS NOT TAKEN
PLACE YET.  HOWEVER...WE EMPHASIZE THAT ONE SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON THE
PRECISE TRACK...ESPECIALLY SINCE BONNIE HAS SUCH A LARGE ENVELOPE OF
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS.  EVEN IF THE CURRENT NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION
CONTINUES LONGER THAN FORECAST...BONNIE WOULD STILL MAKE LANDFALL
WITHIN THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA.
 
INTENSITY IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED.  HURRICANE HUNTERS COULD NOT
FIND AN EYE...YET THEY FOUND WINDS TO 114 KNOTS AT THE 700 MB FLIGHT
LEVEL OVER THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT A FEW HOURS AGO.  CLOUD TOPS ON
SATELLITE IMAGERY ARE NOT VERY COLD AND DVORAK ESTIMATES OF
INTENSITY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE PROVIDED BY THE
AIRCRAFT.  THIS UNDERSCORES THE GREAT VALUE OF AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE
IN HURRICANES THAT ARE THREATENING POPULATED COASTAL AREAS.
 
EVEN THOUGH SOME FLUCTUATIONS ARE POSSIBLE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
IN INTENSITY IS FORECAST UNTIL BONNIE PASSES THE OUTER BANKS.
WEAKENING IS FORECAST LATER ON AS IT ENCOUNTERS WESTERLY SHEAR AND
COOLER WATERS.

LATEST RECON FIX GIVES A MOTION OF 320/12 OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS BUT
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS MOTION SUGGESTS MORE OF A NORTHWARD DIRECTION.
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/12.  ALL GUIDANCE SHOWS AN
IMMEDIATE TURN TOWARD THE NORTH EXCEPT THE UKMET WHICH CONTINUES A

FORECAST DISREGARDS THE UKMET AND MAKES A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST

PERHAPS THE EXTENSION OF THE WARNING TO EDISTO BEACH WILL TURN OUT
TO HAVE BEEN UNNECESSARY...BUT THERE IS NO POINT IN AGONIZING ABOUT
IT.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWS RAPID ACCELERATION AFTER 24 HOURS
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK SHOWS THE CENTER CROSSING THE COAST JUST SOUTH OF

RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT...AND SATELLITE NOW HINT AT THE EXPECTED
TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE INITIAL MOTION...AVERAGED OVER THE PAST
6 HOURS...IS 340 DEGREES WHILE A VERY SHORT-TERM MOTION IS DUE
NORTH.  WE WILL USE 350/10 KT.  THE REDUCED SPEED IS ALSO CONSISTENT
WITH THE FIRST STAGES OF A TURN IN THE TRACK.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
AGAIN ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 100 KT.
 
THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH FEATURES TO THE NNW OF BONNIE APPEAR MORE
PROMINENTLY ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THAN 24 HOUR AGO.  THE SOUTHERN
EXTENT OF THE APPROACHING TROUGH IS FARTHER SOUTH THAN YESTERDAY AS
WELL...AND THIS LENDS ADDITIONAL CONFIDENCE TO THE EXPECTATION THAT
THE HURRICANE WILL SOON BE CAUGHT UP IN THE MIDDLE LATITUDE FLOW AND
EVENTUALLY ACCELERATE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.  THE 06Z AVN AND GFDL
RUNS SHOW THAT EVOLUTION...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL TRACK.
 
IN THE SHORT-TERM...THE GREATER NORTHWARD COMPONENT SUGGESTS A TRACK
A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF 6 HOURS AGO.  THE RATHER SLOW MOTION LIKELY
MEANS A PROLONGED...12-18 HOUR...BATTERING BY STRONG WINDS FOR SOME
PORTIONS OF EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA.  IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE STORM
SURGE WILL PERSIST LONG ENOUGH TO BE INFLUENCED BY AT LEAST TWO
DIFFERENT HIGH TIDES BEFORE BONNIE LEAVES THE AREA.
 
WITH THE CENTER NOW OFFSHORE FROM THE NORTHERN PART OF SOUTH
CAROLINA AND WITH A NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OBSERVED...THE WARNINGS AND
WATCHES SOUTH OF CAPE ROMAIN SOUTH CAROLINA ARE DISCONTINUED.

HURRICANE BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  32
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT WED AUG 26 1998
 
A NEW AND POTENTIALLY SERIOUS FORECAST PROBLEM HAS ARISEN.
AT THE MOMENT...BONNIE IS MOVING NORTHWARD AT 5 TO 10 KT...AND ITS
CENTER IS COMING ASHORE.  HOWEVER...SEVERAL OF TODAY/S COMPUTER
SIMULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE NEARBY SHORT-WAVE COULD BYPASS THE
HURRICANE...LEAVING IT TO MOVE VERY SLOWLY FOR A DAY OR TWO.  IF
THIS OCCURS...IT COULD CREATE AN ENORMOUS FLOOD PROBLEM.
 
SUPPORTING THIS CONSIDERATION IS WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WHICH SHOWS THE
NEARBY SHORT-WAVE TROUGH AXIS NOW APPROACHING THE LONGITUDE OF
BONNIE.  THE NE-SW STRETCHING OF THE UPPER LEVEL CLOUD PATTERN ALSO
SUGGESTS THAT THE TROUGH MIGHT BE EXERTING ITS MAXIMUM INFLUENCE ON
THE MOTION OF BONNIE AT THIS TIME.

FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE...THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS SLOWED CONSIDERABLY
THROUGH 36 HOURS...AND NOW KEEPS THE CENTER OVER EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA THROUGH THAT PERIOD.  THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO THE GFDL
FORECAST.
 
A NOAA RESEARCH AIRCRAFT REPORTED 116 KT AT THE 8000 FT FLIGHT
LEVEL.  A DROPWINDSONDE RELEASED EARLY THIS AFTERNOON BY THE AIR
FORCE MEASURED 110 KT IN THE EASTERN EYEWALL NOT FAR ABOVE THE
SURFACE.  ESTIMATED MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS ARE 100 KT.  WEAKENING
WILL OCCUR AFTER LANDFALL.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS FROM VIRGINIA NORTHWARD HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO
ACCOMMODATE THE CHANGE IN FORECAST TRACK.
 
THE HURRICANE HUNTERS RECENTLY EXTRAPOLATED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF
959 MB.  DROPSONDE PRESSURES...NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS FIX...HAVE
BEEN CONSISTENTLY 3 OR 4 MB HIGHER.

RADAR...SURFACE DATA...AND RECON INDICATE LITTLE MOVEMENT...PERHAPS
A SLIGHT NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD DRIFT...OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. 
THE CENTER HAS BEEN HUGGING THE COASTLINE BUT IT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE
SLOWLY ACROSS EXTREME EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA DURING THE NEXT 24
HOURS IN AGREEMENT WITH MOST OF OUR OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTIONS. 
THE NHC FORECAST ALSO SHOWS A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST AND EAST-
NORTHEAST LATER IN THE PERIOD...WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE GFDL TRACK.

THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF BONNIE WILL LIKELY PRODUCE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF
RAINFALL.  TOTALS UP TO 20 INCHES OR SO ARE SHOWN BY THE LATEST GFDL
RUN.  THIS WOULD CREATE A SERIOUS FLOOD PROBLEM.  

THE CIRCULATION IS GRADUALLY WEAKENING AS IT INTERACTS WITH LAND. 
MAXIMUM DOPPLER RADAR VELOCITIES FROM THE WSR-88D ARE BARELY 90
KNOTS AT 4000 TO 5000 FT TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  CURRENT
INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 85 KNOTS AND GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD

...CORRECTION FOR FORCAST POSITIONS AND INLAND DESIGNATIONS...
 
RADAR AND AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE FIXES OVER THE LAST

A SLOW PACE.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 020/04 KNOTS.
LATEST RECON WINDS ARE SHOWING A MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND OF

HURRICANE FORCE WINDS WITH ONLY TROPICAL STORM REPORTS.  THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 75 KNOTS.  FURTHER SLOW
WEAKENING IS FORECAST AS THE SYSTEM TRAVERSES LAND OVER THE

NWS DOPPLER RADAR DISPLAYS SUGGEST THAT MAXIMUM SUSTAINED SURFACE
WINDS IN BONNIE HAVE DROPPED BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH.  THE CENTER
PASSED NEAR NEW BERN AND CHERRY PT MCAS AROUND 13Z...WITH PRESSURES
DROPPING TO ABOUT 983 MB.  THESE DATA SUPPORT DOWNGRADING BONNIE TO
A TROPICAL STORM...WITH 55 KT WINDS AND SOME GUSTS STILL TO
HURRICANE FORCE...MAINLY OVER THE WATERS TO THE EAST.
 
THE MOTION ESTIMATE IS 035 DEGREES AT 5 KT AND THE FORECAST TRACK IS
LITTLE CHANGED.  THIS KEEPS THE POTENTIAL HIGH FOR FLOODING RAINS
OVER EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA THROUGH TONIGHT.  SOME INCREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED IS PREDICTED...IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT GFDL OUTPUT.
THE SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO REMAIN AT TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH AFTER
EXITING THE COAST AND COULD PASS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE NORTHEASTERN
STATES TO CAUSE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS ALONG/NEAR THE COAST.

DOPPLER RADAR DATA AND OBSERVATIONS FROM OCRACOKE ISLAND AND DIAMOND

BIT AT THE SURFACE AS THE CIRCULATION BEGINS TO MOVE BACK OVER
WATER.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE NOW ESTIMATED AT 60 KT WITH GUSTS TO

DOPPLER RADAR DATA ALSO SHOWS AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED TO ABOUT
8 KT ALONG A HEADING OF 45 DEGREES.  MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE
SHOWS AN ACCELERATION OFFSHORE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND THEN THE

PICKED UP BY THE WESTERLIES.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS TRACK.
 
THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED TO 50 KNOTS BASED ON DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES AND SURFACE WIND OBSERVATIONS.  A BAND OF DEEP CONVECTION
IS LOCATED TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER...AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS
VERY LITTLE CLOUDINESS REMAINING ON THE WEST HALF OF THE STORM...THE
SYSTEM STILL HAS MORE TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS THAN EXTRATROPICAL. 
THE FORECAST WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS THROUGH 24 HOURS WHEN
THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO BE EXTRATROPICAL.

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT HAS CLOSED OFF A WEAK
LOW LEVEL CENTER IN THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND WE ARE UPGRADING
THE DISTURBED AREA TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/11.  THIS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AS
WE HAVE NOT BEEN TRACKING A WELL-DEFINED CENTE FOR VERY LONG.  THE
GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR THE NEXT 72
HOURS AND THE CENTER SHOULD REACH THE TEXAS COAST IN ABOUT 18 HOURS.
 
ALTHOUGH THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS ONLY ABOUT 20 KNOTS...
SATELLITE IMAGERY IS FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE AND THERE IS NO KNOWN REASON
TO PREVENT INTENSIFICATION.  TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE ISSUED FOR
MOST OF THE TEXAS COAST ON THIS BASIS.

MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL (5 KFT) WIND OF 57 KNOTS IN THE NORTHEAST
QUADRANT.  WIND ESTIMATES FROM THE NWS CORPUS CHRISTI (KCRP)
WSR-88D HAVE BEEN RUNNING BETWEEN 60 AND 65 KNOTS AT 3500 TO
4500 FT.  THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED BY RECONNAISSANCE
IS 1003 MB.  THE ROCKPORT ASOS SITE AT 08Z REPORTED 36 KNOTS
SUSTAINED WINDS WITH A GUST TO 42 KNOTS.  BASED ON THIS DATA...
THE INITIAL INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY WILL BE ADJUSTED UP TO 50
KNOTS.  LITTLE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS EXPECTED BEFORE
LANDFALL.
 
AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE NWS OFFICES ALONG THE COASTS OF LOUISIANA
AND TEXAS...THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING WILL REDUCED ON THE EAST
SIDE...AND NOW EXTENDS FROM SABINE PASS TO BROWNSVILLE TEXAS.  THE
SMALL CRAFT REMAIN IN PORT STATEMENT WILL EXTEND FROM THE MOUTH OF
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER TO SABINE PASS.  FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS WILL
LIKELY ME MADE LATER THIS MORNING.
 
THE PRIMARY THREAT POSED BY CHARLEY WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.
RADAR 3-HOURLY PRECIPITATION ESTIMATES FROM KCRP ARE AVERAGING
AROUND 3.5 INCHES BETWEEN CORPUS CHRISTI AND VICTORIA TEXAS.
RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 4 TO 8 INCHES ARE POSSIBLE AS CHARLEY MOVES
INLAND.
 
THE LATEST RADAR POSITIONS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LAST
AIRCRAFT CENTER FIX.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/09 KNOTS.
THIS MOTION SHOULD BRING THE CENTER OF CHARLEY ON THE COAST IN
THE VICINITY OF PORT ARANSAS TEXAS WITHIN THE NEXT 4 TO 5 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE TURNS THE SYSTEM
TO A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD HEADING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO...AND IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH LBAR.
THIS TRACK REPRESENTS A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO THE RIGHT FROM THE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST TUE AUG 25 1998

DANIELLE HAS A SYMMETRIC APPEARANCE IN SATELLITE IMAGERY WITH 
GOOD OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THERE HAS BEEN A 
RATHER PERSISTENT AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER OF
DANIELLE OVER THE LAST 4-6 HOURS.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 3.5 AND 2.5...RESPECTIVELY.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 45 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  

MODEST SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR SEEN IN SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND 
IN ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL
SATELLITE STUDIES...IS ASSOCIATE WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW SEEN IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY BETWEEN DANIELLE AND THE LESSER ANTILLES. THIS
LOW IS FORECAST TO MOVE WESTWARD DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST ALTHOUGH DANIELLE MAY
EXPERIENCE SOME VERTICAL SHEAR DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS. BY
48 HOURS DANIELLE IS BROUGHT TO HURRICANE STRENGTH AS THE SHEAR
IS FORECAST TO DIMINISH.   
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/18 KNOTS.  THE 00Z AVIATION
MODEL CONTINUES TO SUGGEST THAT A RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC NORTH OF THE LESSER ANTILLES.  THIS WOULD RESULT
IN A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
POSSIBLE A MORE WESTWARD HEADING BEYOND 72 HOURS.  THE GFDL SHOWS
THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO AND IS THE LEFT-MOST OF THE 06Z TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A LITTLE RIGHT OF THE

FORECAST MODEL WHICH BRINGS THE HURRICANE TO 100 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/18. MODELS IN GENERAL SUGGEST THAT THE
HURRICANE SHOULD TURN A LITTLE MORE TO THE WEST AS THE RIDGE BUILDS
TO THE NORTH. THIS IS EMPHASIZED BY GFDL WHICH TURNS THE DANIELLE
WESTWARD IN ABOUT 24 HOURS OR SO.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN
BETWEEN THE GFDL AND LBAR. 

A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE NECESSARY FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN
LEEWARD ISLANDS AS EARLY AS TONIGHT OR WEDNESDAY.

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER   6
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 PM EST TUE AUG 25 1998
 
DANIELLE IS A SMALL HURRICANE IN TERMS OF ITS AREA OF DEEP
CONVECTION BUT IT HAS A LARGE ENVELOPE. T-NUMBERS CONTINUE TO
INCREASE AND TAFB ESTIMATED THAT WINDS ARE ABOUT 75 KNOTS. DANIELLE
HAS A WELL ESTABLISHED OUTFLOW AND THE ANTICYCLONE ALOFT IS FORECAST
TO MOVE WITH THE SYSTEM.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE HURRICANE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THIS IS ALSO
INDICATED BY SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL WHICH BRINGS DANIELLE TO
ABOUT 107 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 290/18.  A STRONG 500 MB RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
DEVELOP OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  THIS PATTERN WILL PROBABLY
KEEP DANIELLE ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK OR EVEN A LITTLE
MORE TO THE WEST THAN THE PRESENT COURSE AND THIS IS REFLECTED BY
MOST OF THE MODELS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
ENSEMBLE BUT CLOSER TO THE GDFL SOLUTION.  ON THIS TRACK THE CENTER
OF DANIELLE WILL PASS TO THE NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS...AS
SUGGESTED BY THE LATEST 12Z GDFL RUN.  HOWEVER...ANY DEVIATION TO
THE LEFT OF THE TRACK WOULD BRING DANIELLE CLOSER THE LEEWARD
ISLANDS.  THEREFORE...A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THIS
AREA TONIGHT OR WEDNESDAY.

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER   8
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST WED AUG 26 1998
 
AN EYE IS NO LONGER APPARENT IN SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE CENTER OF
DANIELLE IS EMBEDDED WITHIN -70 DEG C CLOUD TOPS.  DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB ARE NOW 90 KNOTS...AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS INCREASED TO 90 KNOTS.  THE OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED OVER
THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE DUE TO SOUTHEASTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR.  
THIS IS CONFIRMED BY ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES...CIMSS.  THE UPPER LOW SEEN IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY JUST NORTHWEST OF PUERTO RICO IS EXPECTED 
TO SHIFT WEST AS THE ANTICYCLONE OVER DANIELLE BUILDS IN.  THE
INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR CONTINUED STRENGTHENING. THIS IS 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY
PREDICTION SCHEME..SHIPS. 
 
DANIELLE HAS CONTINUED ON A WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE THIS MORNING...
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/19 KNOTS.  A STRONG 500 MB
RIDGE IS FORECAST TO BUILD OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC DURING
THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS.  THIS SHOULD KEEP DANIELLE ON A GENERAL WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND ALL OF THE 06Z
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS CLUSTERED ON THIS HEADING.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK MAINTAINS A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 
THE PERIOD WITH A SLIGHT DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED BETWEEN 48 AND
72 HOURS.  THIS IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL SOLUTION.  

BASED ON THIS TRACK A HURRICANE WATCH IS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE
NORTHERN PORTION OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...
ANY SOUTHWARD DEVIATION IN THE TRACK WOULD BRING DANIELLE CLOSER 
TO THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.  THEREFORE...ALL INTERESTS IN THE LEEWARD  
ISLANDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
HURRICANE.

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER   9
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT WED AUG 26 1998
 
THE COMBINATION OF AN UPPER-LOW AHEAD OF DANIELLE AND THE FAST
FORWARD MOTION OF THE HURRICANE IS CAUSING SOME SHEARING. THE
EARLIER RAPID DEVELOPMENT TREND IS NOT LONGER OCCURRING AT THIS
TIME. THE EYE IS NOT LONGER VISIBLE BUT IS PROBABLY EMBEDDED WITH AN
AREA OF ASYMMETRIC DEEP CONVECTION. INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 90
KNOTS AND IT HAS BEEN HELD FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND THEN
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  THE REASONINGS ARE THAT GLOBAL MODELS
ARE MOVING THE UPPER-LOW TOWARD THE WEST-SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF
DANIELLE...CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT OF LOW SHEAR. IN ADDITION...SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL BRINGS DANIELLE TO ABOUT 105 KNOTS BY 72
HOURS.
 
DANIELLE CONTINUES MOVING AT 290/18. MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS ARE
DEVELOPING A STRONG MID-LEVEL RIDE OVER THE CENTRAL NORTH ATLANTIC.
THIS PATTERN WOULD FAVOR A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS.
TRACK MODELS ARE ALSO IN AGREEMENT WITH A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK
ALTHOUGH GFDL...BAMD AND NOGAPS MOVE THE HURRICANE ON A MORE
WESTWARD TRACK.  WE HAVE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE UPPER LOW AHEAD OF
DANIELLE BECAUSE IF THE HURRICANE GETS INVOLVED WITHIN THE FLOW
AROUND THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE UPPER-LOW...A MORE WESTWARD COULD
OCCUR. THIS APPEARS NOT TO BE THE CASE AT THIS TIME.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT WED AUG 26 1998

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT STRONG SOUTHERLY SHEAR IS BEGINNING
TO DISRUPT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH DANIELLE.  DVORAK 
INTENSITY ESTIMATES SUGGESTS THAT THE HURRICANE HAS WEAKENED TO 75
KNOTS OR LESS. A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE AREA
TONIGHT AND WILL GIVE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE INTENSITY.

DANIELLE IS A SMALL SYSTEM WHICH IN GENERAL IS VERY SENSITIVE TO
SHEAR.  THE UPPER TROUGH/LOW AHEAD OF DANIELLE IS RETROGRADING AS
FORECAST BY MODELS BUT IT IS STILL CLOSE ENOUGH TO RESTRICT THE
WESTERN OUTFLOW. WE ARE FORECASTING SOME WEAKENING DURING THE NEXT
12 TO 24 HOURS BUT ASSUMING THAT THE SHEAR WILL RELAX...A GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED THEREAFTER.  IN FACT...SHIPS INTENSITY
FORECAST MODEL INSISTS ON INTENSIFYING DANIELLE.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 290/18. A STRONG MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH IS FORECAST
TO BUILD OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC. IN RESPONSE TO THAT
FEATURE...THE GFDL..BAM-DEEP... NOGAPS AND LBAR MODELS MAINTAIN THE
SAME WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
GOES ALONG WITH THESE MODELS...INDICATING SOME DECREASE IN FORWARD

AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT HAS FOUND A 70-KNOT DANIELLE WHICH
IS VERY ASYMMETRIC IN ITS WIND FIELD WITH MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS
OF 37 KNOTS OVER THE SOUTHWEST QUAD...77 KNOTS OVER THE NORTHEAST
QUAD AND 73 KNOTS OVER THE NORTHEAST QUAD.  THE LARGE ASYMMETRY IS
UNDOUBTABLY DUE TO THE LARGE...18 KNOTS...TRANSLATION SPEED AND THE
LARGE PRESSURE GRADIENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH. 
THEREFORE THE WIND RADII WILL CHANGE SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THIS
PACKAGE.  THE LOWEST ESTIMATED SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 992MB LOCATED
NEAR THE WIND MINIMUM.

SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW STRONG SOUTHERLY SHEAR DISRUPTING
THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH DANIELLE.  DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES REMAIN AT 4.5 OR ABOUT 75 KNOTS.
 
WE NOW ESTIMATE THE SURFACE WINDS TO BE 70 KNOTS AT THE SURFACE AND
HOLD THAT INTENSITY THROUGH 24 HOURS...INCREASING THE FORECAST
INTENSITY TO 95 KNOTS AT 72 HOURS.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE
REDUCTION IN FORECAST VERTICAL SHEAR FOR THE LATTER PERIODS.  THIS
IS IN KEEPING WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST.   
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 285/18.  A STRONG MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH CONTINUES
TO BE FORECAST TO BUILD OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  IN
RESPONSE TO THAT FEATURE...THE GFDL..BAM-DEEP...NOGAPS AND LBAR
MODELS MAINTAIN THE SAME WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 48 HOURS AND
THEN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES ALONG WITH

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT THU AUG 27 1998

THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH CHANGE TO THE INITIAL MOTION OR TO THE TRACK
FORECAST.  THERE IS A WEAKNESS IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN ATLANTIC NEAR THE U.S. EAST COAST
PARTIALLY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF BONNIE.  AS BONNIE SLOWLY EXITS THE
SCENE...SOME RIDGING WILL PROBABLY BUILD BACK IN OVER THAT AREA. 
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...THE 18Z NCEP AVN MODEL RUN
SHOWS A RATHER LARGE 500 MB TROUGH CARVING OUT OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
WHICH SHOULD CREATE A MORE NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF STEERING.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS REASONING AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WITH THE GFDL AND BAM GUIDANCE AS WELL.

AIR FORCE RECON FOUND A 992 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE AND A TIGHT WIND
CENTER THAT IS IN THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE MAIN CONVECTIVE CLOUD
MASS.  DANIELLE IS A SMALL HURRICANE IN SIZE.  SHIP REPORTS INDICATE
THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII ARE NO MORE THAN 100 N MI.  
CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 80 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  DANIELLE
HAS A FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN AND THE
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS VERTICAL SHEAR MAPS SHOW REASONABLY
WEAK VERTICAL SHEAR IN THE NEAR ENVIRONMENT.  THE LATEST SHIPS MODEL
OUTPUT ALSO SHOWS LIGHT SHEAR.  STRENGTHENING IS PREDICTED...SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORIES AND TO THE SHIPS GUIDANCE.  DANIELLE
COULD BECOME A CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

GUIDANCE...AND IS THE SAME AS IN PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/15.  THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF
A RIDGE WILL BUILD IN AFTER HURRICANE BONNIE MOVES OUT.  MOST OF THE
TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN INDICATING THAT A
GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH SHOULD OCCUR AFTER 36 HOURS OR SO.
HOWEVER...MANY OF THESE GUIDANCE MODELS USE THE AVIATION MODEL FOR
THE BACKGROUND FIELD AND THE AVIATION MODEL SEEMS CONTAMINATED BY A
BOGUS VORTEX NEAR THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF
THIS NORTHWARD MOTION.  OUR CURRENT FORECAST TRACK STILL SEEMS
REASONABLE GIVEN THAT THE UKMET MODEL IS TO THE RIGHT OF OUR TRACK
AND THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL IS TO THE LEFT OF OUR TRACK.

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER  17
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT FRI AUG 28 1998

DANIELLE IS A SMALL AND TIGHT HURRICANE.  LATEST RECON  FOUND A 20 N
MI DIAMETER EYE WITH EXCELLENT PRESENTATION ON RADAR. AND MEASURED
79 KNOT-WINDS FROM THE SOUTHWEST ABOUT 9 N MI FROM THE EYE.  MINIMUM
PRESSURE WAS 988 MB. THE UPPER-LOW OVER THE EASTERN BAHAMAS IS
MOVING WESTWARD AHEAD OF DANIELLE AND WILL LIKELY PROVIDE A
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT ALOFT FOR SOME STRENGTHENING. THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST AND THE GFDL COUPLED
MODELS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS DANIELLE TO 100 KNOTS BY 48
HOURS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14.  THE RIDGE NORTH OF DANIELLE IS EXPECTED
TO WEAKEN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WHILE A STRONG MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. IN
RESPONSE TO THAT PATTERN...TRACK MODELS...WHICH ARE IN REMARKABLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT... CONSISTENTLY TURN DANIELLE NORTHWESTWARD AND
NORTHWARD BEYOND 48 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE MODEL
ENSEMBLE TURNING DANIELLE NORTHWARD BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. IN THIS CASE THE HURRICANE WILL STAY AWAY FROM THE U.S.
SOUTHEAST COAST.  THE NOAA HIGH ALTITUDE JET WILL SAMPLE THE
ENVIRONMENT NORTH OF DANIELLE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND
WILL PROVIDE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE.

AN AIR FORCE PLANE HAS BEEN OBSERVING DANIELLE DURING THE MORNING
AND MEASURED FLIGHT-LEVEL PEAK WINDS OF 88 KNOTS ABOUT 12 NM FROM
THE EYE. THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED SO FAR IS 986 MB AND
SATELLITE ESTIMATES ARE BETWEEN 77 AND 90 KNOTS. INITIAL INTENSITY
IS SET AT 80 KNOTS. THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER THIRTY-
DEGREE CELSIUS WATERS AND THE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO RELAX. THE
HURRICANE HAS NO WESTERLIES AHEAD AT ALL AND IN FACT...ONE CAN
OBSERVE THE HIGH CLOUDS STREAMING WESTWARD FROM THE HURRICANE. WE DO
NOT SEE THAT VERY OFTEN IN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WHERE WESTERLIES ARE
MORE THAN OFTEN DISRUPTING THE TROPICAL CYCLONES.  THE ENVIRONMENT
LOOKS FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH SHIPS

11 PM EDT FRI AUG 28 1998
 
AIR FORCE RECONN OBSERVED DANIELLE DURING THE DAY AND MEASURED
FLIGHT-LEVEL PEAK WINDS OF 88 KNOTS ABOUT 12 NM FROM THE EYE.  THIS
EVENING THE HIGHEST RECONN WIND SPEED AT FLIGHT LEVEL WAS 67 KNOTS
OVER THE NORTHWEST QUAD WITH A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 989 MB. 
DVORAK SATELLITE ESTIMATES REMAIN BETWEEN 77 AND 90 KNOTS.

THEREFORE DANIELLE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN AT 80 KNOTS.  THE
HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER THIRTY DEGREE CELSIUS WATERS AND
THE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO RELAX.  THE ENVIRONMENT LOOKS FAVORABLE FOR
STRENGTHENING AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST AND THE GFDL COUPLED MODELS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST BRINGS DANIELLE TO 100 KNOTS BY 48 HOURS.
 
DANIELLE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/11...A LITTLE SLOWER AND MORE
NORTHERLY THAN PREVIOUSLY.  THE RIDGE NORTH OF DANIELLE IS EXPECTED
TO WEAKEN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WHILE A STRONG MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. IN
RESPONSE TO THAT PATTERN...ALL TRACK MODELS REMAIN IN GOOD AGREEMENT

NORTHEASTWARD AHEAD OF THE TROUGH BEYOND 48 HOURS.  THE EXCELLENT
MODEL AGREEMENT IN TRACK INCREASES THE LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH KEEPS THE HURRICANE AWAY FROM THE EAST COAST
OF THE UNITED STATES.

HPC RAISED A POINT DURING THE CONFERENCE CALL ON THE 18Z AVIATION
RUN OF THE MRF MODEL.  THIS RUN AND THE GUIDANCE DEPENDENT ON IT
TEND TO SLOW THE HURRICANE DURING THE LAST PERIOD.  THE INTERESTING
THING ABOUT THIS 18Z RUN IS THE SPURIOUS VORTEX BEING GENERATED EAST
OF DANIELLE WHICH APPEARS TO BE DISRUPTING THE RIDGE AND THEREFORE
SLOWING THE NORTHWARD PROGRESS OF DANIELLE.  THE OOZ RUN OF THE MRF
MODEL WILL CONTAIN THE JET DROPWINSONDE AND MAY HELP TO RESOLVE THIS
QUESTION.  NO OTHER GLOBAL MODEL SUGGEST THIS SLOWING OF DANIELLE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SAT AUG 29 1998
 
THE AIR FORCE RECONN MISSION WHICH COVERED THE 00Z AND 06Z FIXES
REPORTED FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS IN THE MID SEVENTIES OVER THE NORTHERN
QUADRANTS.  CENTRAL PRESSURES RANGED FROM 989 TO 991 MB.  DVORAK
SATELLITE ESTIMATES REMAIN BETWEEN 77 AND 90 KNOTS.
 
THEREFORE DANIELLE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN AT 80 KNOTS.  THE
VERTICAL SHEAR CONTINUES TO BE FORECAST TO RELAX AND EVEN NOW THE
ENVIRONMENT SEEMS FAVORABLE FOR SOME STRENGTHENING BUT IT HAS YET TO
MATERIALIZE.  IN KEEPING WITH THE SHIPS FORECAST INTENSITY MODEL...
THE FORECAST INTENSITY WILL BE KEPT AT 80 KNOTS THROUGH 12 HOURS AND
THEN INCREASE AT A MODEST RATE.
 
DANIELLE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/12...A LITTLE MORE NORTHERLY THAN
PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF A MORE SOUTHERLY INITIAL POSITION.  THE RIDGE
NORTH OF DANIELLE IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN IN 48 HOURS OVER THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC WHILE A STRONG MID-LATITUDE TROUGH IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER
THE EASTERN UNITED STATES IN THAT SAME TIME FRAME.  IN RESPONSE TO
THAT PATTERN...ALL TRACK MODELS REMAIN IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND
CONSISTENTLY TURN DANIELLE NORTHWARD AND NORTHEASTWARD AHEAD OF THE
TROUGH BEYOND 48 HOURS.
 
THE QUESTION OF DANIELLE SLOWING DOWN AFTER THE 36 HOUR FORECAST
PERIOD REMAINS WITH THE 00Z AVIATION RUN.  NOGAPS AND THE UKMET
MODELS FOR 00Z DO NOT SLOW DANIELLE AND INDEED ACCELERATE IT TO THE
NORTHEAST AFTER THE TURN AT 48 HOURS.  SINCE THE AVIATION RUN
APPEARS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE APPROACHING SHORT WAVE TROUGH,
IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE SPURIOUS VORTEX TO THE EAST MUST BE
DISRUPTING THE RIDGE.
 
ANALYSIS OF THE JET DROPS SHOW A GOOD RIDGE THROUGH 400 MB NORTH OF
DANIELLE.  THE DROPS DO NOT EXTEND FAR ENOUGH EAST TO PREVENT THE
SPURIOUS VORTEX FROM GENERATING.

SATELLITE AND RECON INDICATE THAT DANIELLE HAS NOT CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE YESTERDAY.  THE PLANE REPORTED A CLOSED EYE WALL
OF 10 NMI DIAMETER AND A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 988 MB.  THERE
HAS BEEN NO REPORTS OF WINDS HIGHER THAN 60 TO 70 KNOTS AT THIS
TIME.  THE HURRICANE LOOKS IMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE IMAGES WITH A
CIRCULAR CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST AND TWO OUTFLOW CHANNELS. WE ARE
KEEPING THE INITIAL INTENSITY AT 80 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  IN SPITE OF
SUCH A GOOD ENVIRONMENT...DANIELLE HAS FAILED TO INTENSIFY AS
FORECAST.  HOWEVER...THE LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT INTENSITY CHANGES
SUGGESTS THAT THE HURRICANE SHOULD STRENGTHEN.  SHIPS INTENSITY
FORECAST MODEL INSISTS ON BRINGING DANIELLE TO 100 KNOTS AND SO DOES
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION IS 295/12.  THE KEY PLAYER IS THE MID-LATITUDE TROUGH
WHICH IS FORECAST TO BE MOVING OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES AND
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THIS TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY DANIELLE NORTHWARD IN ABOUT 24
TO 36 HOURS AND THEN NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC. TRACK
MODELS CAPTURED THIS FEATURE AND ALL OF THEM...CONSISTENTLY TURN
DANIELLE NORTHEASTWARD AHEAD OF THE TROUGH AND AWAY FROM THE U.S.

RECON FOUND THAT THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM IS BETTER THAN
YESTERDAY...WITH A WELL DEFINED 10 N MI DIAMETER CLOSED EYE-WALL BUT
THE HIGHEST SAMPLED WINDS WERE ONLY 65 TO 70 KNOTS. SATELLITE IMAGES
CONTINUE TO SHOW AN IMPRESSIVE CLOUD PATTERN AND SATELLITE WIND
ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB ARE 77 KNOTS. BASED ON RECON REPORTS THE
INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 70 KNOTS IN THIS ADVISORY. 
KEEPING IN MIND THAT WE HAVE LIMITED SKILLS IN PREDICTING CHANGES IN
INTENSITY...I DO NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT COULD STOP THE HURRICANE FROM
STRENGTHENING DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND THAT IS REFLECTED
IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THIS IS SUPPORTED BY SHIPS INTENSITY
FORECAST MODEL WHICH BRINGS DANIELLE TO 100 KNOTS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/12.  DANIELLE HAS NOT TURNED YET BUT THAT IS
NOT EXPECTED UNTIL SUNDAY.  THE KEY PLAYER IS THE MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO BE MOVING OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES
AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY DANIELLE NORTHWARD IN ABOUT 24

DANIELLE CONTINUES TO MOVE TOWARD 300 DEGREES BUT ITS FORWARD SPEED
HAS DECREASED TO ABOUT 9 KT.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE HURRICANE
REACHING THE SOUTHWESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE AS
INITIALIZED IN THE 18Z AVN.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A NARROW
RIDGE EXTENDING FARTHER WEST ALONG 30N.  IT IS THIS FEATURE THAT
IS EXPECTED TO GIVE WAY TOMORROW AS THE TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES
APPROACHES THE EAST COAST.
 
TRACK GUIDANCE LOOKS MUCH LIKE 6 HOURS AGO...BUT THIS IS NO SURPRISE
AS BOTH SETS WERE BASED PRIMARILY ON DATA FROM 12Z.  IF THERE IS TO
BE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IT WOULD LIKELY OCCUR IN THE NEXT ADVISORY
WHICH CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS THAT WILL HAVE
DATA OBTAINED FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF SOUNDINGS DEPLOYED THIS EVENING
BY NOAA G-IV AND P-3 AIRCRAFT IN DANIELLE AND ITS VICINITY.  FOR
NOW...THE TRACK FORECAST CONTINUES TO SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH
IN ABOUT 24 HOURS AND THEN A NORTHEASTWARD MOTION BY 48 HOURS.  THIS
IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT GUIDANCE.  NO AVAILABLE MODEL TRACK
CROSSES 75W.
 
THE NOAA HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION...HRD...HAS TRANSMITTED TO THE
NHC FOR THE FIRST TIME AN ANALYSIS OF DOPPLER RADAR WINDS OBTAINED
ONBOARD THE NOAA P-3S.  IT SHOWS A BAND OF HURRICANE FORCE WINDS IN
THE NORTHWEST SEMICIRCLE AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 3000 FT.  WHILE THE
HURRICANE HUNTERS HAVE FOUND FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS AT 5000 FT NO HIGHER
THAN 67 KT...A NOAA DROPSONDE RELEASED INTO THE EYEWALL HAD WINDS AS
STRONG AS 77 KT AT THE ALTITUDE CORRESPONDING TO 963 MB...AND 57 KT
AT THE SURFACE.  OUR ESTIMATED MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS ARE NOW 65 KT.
 
ALSO WITH HRDS ASSISTANCE...IT APPEARS THAT DURING THE NEXT 48 HOURS
DANIELLE WILL BE MOVING OVER SEVERAL PATCHES OF WATERS PREVIOUSLY
COOLED BY BONNIE/S PASSAGE.  THIS COULD BE A LIMITING FACTOR FOR
DEVELOPMENT AND THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS ADJUSTED DOWNWARD.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 300/09.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS GUIDANCE...SHOWING A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH
AND NORTHEAST AS A TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES RECURVES THE HURRICANE. 
THIS IS BASED ON LOTS OF DATA OVER THE OCEAN FROM AN INTENSIVE MULTI
AIRCRAFT MISSION LAST NIGHT.  THE OFFICAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED
SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BUT IS STILL LEFT OF
MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.

THE HIGHEST RECON WIND FROM THE MOST RECENT FLIGHT WAS 69 KNOTS AT
850 MB IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE RECON REPORTED THAT THE
EYEWALL HAD FALLEN APART AT 03Z BUT WAS AGAIN IDENTIFIABLE AT 05Z
WITH A 20 NMI DIAMETER.  THEREFORE THE INITIAL WIND SPEED REMAINS AT
65 KNOTS.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL SHOWS GRADUAL STRENGTHENING AS
DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...EVEN THOUGH THE SSTS WERE COOLED SOME
BY BONNIES PASSAGE.  THE SSTS ARE STILL ABOVE 86C AND THERE IS
LITTLE VERTICAL SHEAR NEARBY.

TRACK FORECAST OR REASONING.  A GRADUAL TURN TO THE RIGHT...IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ALL OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE...IS EXPECTED.  A BROAD MID-

PRESSURE IS 988 MB...ABOUT THE SAME AS 12 HOURS AGO. DANIELLE IS NOW
MOVING OVER THE PATH OF BONNIE...AND THE PASSAGE OF THE PREVIOUS
HURRICANE HAS LIKELY COOLED THE SST IN THE AREA.  THIS MAY BE

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER  27
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT SUN AUG 30 1998
 
THE LATEST VORTEX DATA FROM AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT SHOWED A MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND OF 70-KNOTS IN THE 
NORTHEAST QUADRANT...A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 983 MB...AND
A 20 NMI DIAMETER EYE.  THIS DATA SUGGESTS THAT DANIELLE IS GOING
THROUGH AN INTENSIFICATION CYCLE...AND THE CURRENT INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS INCREASED TO 70 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  NOAA P-3
ON-BOARD DOPPLER RADAR IMAGES AND WIND/PRESSURE PLOTS SUPPLIED BY
THE HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION...HRD...INDICATE THAT THE DANIELLE
HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS WITH A TIGHTER
MORE WELL-DEFINED CIRCULATION.  HOWEVER...BOTH DOPPLER RADAR AND
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM REMAINS ASYMMETRIC WITH 
THE STRONGEST CONVECTION CONFINED TO THE WEST OF THE CENTER.
   
THE NOAA P-3 AIRCRAFT GPS-DROPSONDE REPORTED A SST OF 26 DEG C
SOUTH OF THE EYE.  SST ANALYSES THROUGH 22 AUG SUGGEST THAT THIS
REPRESENTS ABOUT A 4 DEG C COOLING ATTRIBUTABLE TO BONNIE.  SOME
GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST ALONG THE LINES OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AS DANIELLE MOVES AWAY FROM THE BONNIE/S COOL WAKE AND
INTO WARMER WATERS.  
 
POSITION FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE AND NOAA P-3 RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT SUGGEST THAT THE GRADUAL RIGHT-HAND TURN IS UNDER WAY. 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 325/05 KNOTS.  THE NOAA G-IV 
JET AIRCRAFT PERFORMED A SYNOPTIC FLOW MISSION THIS AFTERNOON TO
SAMPLE THE STEERING ENVIRONMENT NORTH OF DANIELLE.  THIS DATA
INDICATES THAT THE BROAD 500 MB TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
CONTINUES TO ERODE THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND SHOULD PERMIT DANIELLE
TO TAKE A NORTH...THEN NORTHEASTERLY TRACK THE NEXT 12 TO 36 HOURS. 
ALL OF THE AVAILABLE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE THIS SCENARIO
...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK...WITH A MARKED ACCELERATION
BEYOND 48 HOURS. THIS FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS FAR ENOUGH WEST OF BERMUDA TO
PRECLUDE ANY WATCH ISSUANCES AT THIS TIME.

THE MOTION OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS WAS 335/05 AND OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS APPEARS TO BE EVEN MORE NORTHWARD.  THE MOTION CONTINUES TO
CLOSELY FOLLOW THE FORECAST TRACK.  THE NEW MODEL GUIDANCE IS AGAIN
BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE SET OF OBSERVATIONS FROM A MULTIPLE-AIRCRAFT
MISSION OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC AND CONTINUES TO SHOW THE
SAME RECURVATURE SCENARIO AS BEFORE.  SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS VERY SIMILAR TO...AND AN UPDATE OF...THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE
FORECAST TRACK HAS A FORWARD MOTION OF ABOUT 8 KNOTS FOR 24 HOURS
AND ACCELERATING TO 30 KNOTS AT 48 HOURS.
 
RECON REPORTED A CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE OF 980 MB AND A MAX 700-
MB WIND OF 74 KNOTS NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER ALONG WITH A 20 NMI
DIAMETER EYE...SO THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 70 KNOTS.  THE
FORECAST IS FOR GRADUAL STRENGTHENING...THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND FOLLOWS THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL THROUGH 36

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER  29
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON AUG 31 1998

DANIELLE HAS A FAIRLY CLASSICAL PRESENTATION ON THIS MORNINGS
VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES.  THE AIR FORCE PLANE REPORTED A CLOSED
WALL AND A 20 N MI DIAMETER EYE.  LATEST CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS DOWN
TO 976 MB AND MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 85
KNOTS...MAKING DANIELLE A CATEGORY TWO ON THE SAFFIR/SIMPSON
HURRICANE SCALE.   OUTFLOW IS GOOD EXCEPT TO THE SOUTHWEST WHERE A
REMNANT UPPER LOW NEAR FLORIDA IS INTERFERING A BIT.   THE SYSTEM
SHOULD BE MOVING OVER FAIRLY WARM WATERS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR
SO...SO SOME FURTHER INTENSIFICATION IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.

INITIAL MOTION IS NORTH...010/08.  SO FAR...DANIELLE HAS BEEN WELL-
BEHAVED AND THE GUIDANCE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT.  THE HURRICANE
WILL LIKELY BE MAKING CONTACT WITH STRONGER SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING
WINDS IN A DAY OR TWO.  THE LATEST SUITE OF MODEL TRACKS PRETTY MUCH
AGREE ON A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST BUT DIFFER SOMEWHAT ON FORWARD
SPEED.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS MOSTLY AN EXTENSION OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE(S).

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER  30
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON AUG 31 1998

ALTHOUGH THE CLOUD TOPS ARE NOT VERY COLD...THE HURRICANE CONTINUES
TO LOOK IMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE PICTURES AND RECON STILL REPORTS A
CLOSED WALL...A 20 N MI DIAMETER EYE...AND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 975
MB.  CURRENT MAXIMUM WIND SPEED ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 85 KNOTS.  
DANIELLE SHOULD REMAIN OVER WARM WATERS FOR ANOTHER 24 HOURS OR
SO...SO THERE MAY BE SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING.  THE SHIPS MODEL
ALSO SHOWS A LITTLE INCREASE IN WINDS.   

INITIAL MOTION IS NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD...025/09.  THE CONSENSUS OF
THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS IS A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST AND
ACCELERATION...AWAY FROM THE U.S. EAST COAST.  THIS IS QUALITATIVELY
CONSISTENT WITH THE OBSERVED STEERING FLOW.  THE LATEST NHC FORECAST
TRACK IS PRACTICALLY AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL
FORECAST...AND TAKES THE HURRICANE BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE CANADIAN
MARITIMES.  OBVIOUSLY...INTERESTS IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED LOCALES
SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE HURRICANE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS OR UNTIL DANIELLE HAS PASSED THEIR AREA.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON AUG 31 1998
 
AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS REPORTED A 20 NMI DIAMETER EYE WITH A
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 973 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGERY STILL SHOWS A
WELL-DEFINED EYE ALTHOUGH THE EYE IS NOT EMBEDDED WITHIN A VERY COLD
CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST.  INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 85 KNOTS.  THE
USUAL DILEMMA IS FACED CONCERNING THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH LOCATED JUST
TO THE NORTHWEST OF DANIELLE...AS TO WHETHER IT WILL ENHANCE THE
OUTFLOW RESULTING IN STRENGTHENING...OR INCREASE THE SHEAR RESULTING
IN WEAKENING.  OUR INTENSITY FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE AND
SUGGESTS SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING WHILE DANIELLE IS OVER WARM
WATER.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 025/10.   THE STEERING FLOW IS FORECAST
TO BECOME STRONGER AND MORE SOUTHWESTERLY WITH TIME.  CURRENT TRACK
IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...AND IS MIDWAY BETWEEN THE
NAVY NOGAPS AND THE GFDL.

ISSUED FOR THAT ISLAND.
 
THE OFFICIAL TRACK LIES ALONG THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE AND
SHOWS ACCELERATION IN LINE WITH THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS.  THE AVN
OUTPUT SUGGESTS THAT THE SYSTEM WILL BECOME ELONGATED BY 36 TO 48
HOURS...INDICATIVE OF DANIELLE STARTING TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL.
 
HURRICANE HUNTERS FOUND THAT THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DROPPED TO 968

THE CANADIAN WEATHER SERVICE CALLED IN A REPORT FROM ONE OF THEIR
OFFSHORE BUOYS...44141 LOCATED NEAR 42.1N 56.2W...WHICH RECORDED
A 66 KNOT WIND...A 976 MB PRESSURE AND 21 FOOT SEAS AT 07Z.  THE
INITIAL INTENSITY OF 65 KNOTS WILL BE MAINTAINED AND HELD FOR 12
HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE SYSTEM WILL ENTER PROGRESSIVELY COOLER
SST/S AND GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST AS DANIELLE HEADS EASTWARD
INTO THE OPEN ATLANTIC. THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTRA-
TROPICAL BY 24 HOURS.

BASED ON COORDINATION WITH THE MARINE PREDICTION CENTER...MPC...
IN WASHINGTON D.C. THE 34-KNOT AND 50-KNOT RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED
OUTWARD AS THE SYSTEM TRANSITIONS TO AN EXTRA-TROPICAL LOW. 
 
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE REMAINS VERY CONSISTENT FROM PREVIOUS PACKAGE
AS THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST
U.S. SHOULD CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE DANIELLE NORTHEASTWARD FOR THE
NEXT 12 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL TURN TOWARDS THE EAST AND A SLIGHT
DECELERATION BEYOND 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS VERY
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THE
FORECAST IS TERMINATED BY 48 HOURS AS THE SYSTEM BECOMES EXTRA-
TROPICAL.

WE APPRECIATE THE COORDINATION CALL FROM THE CANADIAN WEATHER
SERVICE REGARDING THE BUOY DATA AND FORECAST TRACK...AND TO MPC 
FOR COORDINATION OF THE WIND RADII AND TRACK FORECAST.

TROPICAL STORM EARL DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON AUG 31 1998

AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE INVESTIGATED THE LARGE AREA OF
DISTURBED WEATHER OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO AND FOUND A 1002 MB LOW
PRESSURE CENTER WITH PEAK WINDS TO 43 KNOTS AT THE 1500 FT FLIGHT
LEVEL.  THEREFORE THE SYSTEM IS BEING UPGRADED IMMEDIATELY TO A
TROPICAL STORM.  THIS IS IN FACT THE SAME SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN
TRACKED ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN SEA DURING THE PAST WEEK. 
AT THIS TIME... THE STORM IS BROAD AND DISORGANIZED AND IS STILL IN
THE FORMATIVE STAGES.  THE OUTFLOW IS CURRENTLY RESTRICTED TO THE
WEST BUT UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE FORECAST TO BECOME MORE FAVORABLE AND
EARL COULD BECOME A HURRICANE.  STRENGTHENING IS ALSO CALLED FOR BY
THE NUMERICAL MODELS.

INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO A LACK OF GOOD CENTER FIXES.  OUR
BEST ESTIMATE IS 350/4.  TRACK PREDICTION MODELS SHOW A TURN TO THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST OR NORTHEAST WITH SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED. 
THIS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE STORM BEING STEERED BY THE FLOW
ASSOCIATED WITH A MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH THAT IS FORECAST TO MOVE
ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES ALONG WITH THIS REASONING. HOWEVER...THE
NOGAPS AND UK MET OFFICE MODEL SUGGEST A MUCH SLOWER MOTION.

IF THE ACCELERATING SCENARIO MATERIALIZES...A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE
NECESSARY LATER TONIGHT.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON AUG 31 1998
 
THE MOST RECENT DATA RECEIVED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT INDICATE THAT EARL IS STILL IN ITS
FORMATIVE STAGES.  THE CENTER FIXES HAVE BEEN JUMPING AROUND AND
ARE SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY POSITION.  ON THIS BASIS
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NEARLY STATIONARY.  EARL IS EXPECTED
TO RESUME A SLOW NORTHERLY MOTION TUESDAY. 
 
THE LATEST VORTEX MESSAGE FROM THE RECON AIRCRAFT SHOWS THAT THE
PRESSURE REMAINS STEADY AT 1002 MB WITH ESTIMATED SURFACE WINDS OF
35 KNOTS.  ACCORDINGLY...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 35
KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM HAS A RATHER LARGE STORM ENVELOPE AS SEEN IN
SATELLITE IMAGERY.  THE OUTFLOW REMAINS RESTRICTED OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE BUT UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE FORECAST TO BECOME MORE
FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING.  THE INTENSITY TREND FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY IS RETAINED WHICH BRINGS EARL TO HURRICANE STATUS BY 48
HOURS.

THE SYNOPTIC REASONING BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE WITH A NORTH-NORTHEAST THEN NORTHEAST HEADING
..ALONG WITH AN INCREASE FORWARD SPEED BEYOND 24 HOURS...IN RESPONSE
TO A MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY REGION DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.  THE MAJORITY OF THE 00Z
TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ADVERTISE THIS SCENARIO...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK.  IF FACT...THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS IN VERY CLOSE
AGREEMENT WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE
NAVY NOGAPS AND THE UKMET MODELS BOTH SHOW THE TROUGH BY-PASSING
EARL...LEAVING THE SYSTEM OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  
 
BASED ON THE CURRENT POSITION ESTIMATES...A HURRICANE WATCH WILL
LIKELY BE REQUIRED SOMETIME TUESDAY.

IT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO LOCATE A CENTER ON INFRARED AND THE LAST
RECON WAS AT 00Z.  IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE MOTION IS NEARLY
STATIONARY.   THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS SLOWER THAN LAST ADVISORY AND
SUGGESTS A SHIFT TO THE LEFT.  THE GFDL HAS THE CENTER NEAR THE
LOUISIANA COAST IN 72 HOURS...THE UKMET IS SLOWER...AND THE NOGAPS
IS NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
IS SLOWER AND A LITTLE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
A BURSTING CDO PATTERN OVERNIGHT IS DYING OUT.  THE INITIAL WIND
SPEED IS LEFT AT 35 KNOTS...ASSUMING THE CENTER IS NORTH OF THE
DEEPEST CONVECTION...AS BEFORE.   THE SHIPS MODEL BRINGS EARL TO 60
KNOTS AT 73 HOURS WHILE THE GFDL GOES TO 100 KNOTS BY 48 HOURS.  THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS NOT CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY BRINGING EARL TO 65 KNOTS IN 48 HOURS.
 
THE SLOWER FORECAST TRACK SUGGESTS THAT A WATCH FOR THE NORTHERN

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT TUE SEP 01 1998
 
EARL IS A DEVELOPING TROPICAL CYCLONE AND SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE
THAT IT IS BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED.  A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE FOUND
AN ELONGATED CENTER  OF 999 MB AND THE WIND FIELD IS STILL VERY
ASYMMETRIC. MOST OF THE STRONGEST WINDS ARE WITHIN A BAND TO THE
SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER. FLIGHT-LEVEL PEAK WINDS OF 61 KNOTS WERE
RECENTLY REPORTED. THERE IS SOME SHEARING OVER THE SYSTEM BUT IT IS
FORECAST TO DECREASE AND INDEED SOME UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS
BEGINNING TO DEVELOP OVER THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE STORM . SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL INTENSIFY EARL AND THE GFDL SUGGESTS AN
EXPLOSIVE INTENSIFICATION.   THEREFORE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS
FOR STRENGTHENING.
 
EARL HAS MOVED NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD OR MORE LIKELY IT HAS REFORMED A
LITTLE TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION. THIS MEANS
THE WATCHES OR WARNING MAY BE REQUIRED EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED. DUE
TO THE ONGOING REFORMATION...BOTH INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION ARE
UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME AND ADJUSTMENTS MAYBE NECESSARY.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR A SLOW GENERAL NORTHWARD
MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  HOWEVER...MODELS ARE BEGINNING
TO CHANGE AND THE GFDL...MRF...AND UK ARE TENDING TO THE WEST OF
PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH A BUILDING OF A MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE WESTWARD ACROSS FLORIDA INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF
MEXICO.
 
WE EMPHASIZE THAT ALL INTERESTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO SHOULD MONITOR
THE PROGRESS OF THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TROPICAL CYCLONE.

RECON FIXES AND SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER HAS
REFORMED TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE PREVIOUS POSITION.  THIS MAKES THE
INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.  BEST ESTIMATE IS
020/10.  THIS MOTION WOULD BRING THE CENTER NEAR THE COAST IN ABOUT

BEEN ISSUED ACCORDINGLY. 

SOME TRACK MODELS HAVE BEEN CHANGING THEIR TUNE...PRIMARILY THE
GFDL...WHICH IS MOVING EARL ON A MORE NORTH AND NORTH NORTHEASTERLY
TRACK AND HAS THE CENTER OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE NEAR LAND BY 48
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL BUT SOMEWHAT
FASTER AS SUGGESTED BY OTHER GUIDANCE AND BRINGS THE CENTER NEAR THE
LOUISIANA COAST WITHIN THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.

AIR FORCE RECON SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER HAS AGAIN REFORMED NEARER
TO THE DEEP CONVECTION.  HOWEVER...PART OF THIS MAY REPRESENT REAL
MOTION.  CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 030/9...BUT THIS IS HIGHLY
UNCERTAIN.  BECAUSE OF THE REVISED CENTER POSITION THE FORECAST
TRACK NEEDS TO BE SHIFTED TO THE EAST OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.  TRACK
GUIDANCE REMAINS DIVERSE.  SOME OF THE MODELS DO NOT HAVE EARL
GETTING CAUGHT UP INTO THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF A MID-
TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE EAST-CENTRAL UNITED STATES...AND LEAVE
IT MEANDERING NEAR THE NORTHWEST GULF COAST.  A RATHER EXTENSIVE
SAMPLING OF THE GULF OF MEXICO WITH GPS DROPWINDSONDES BY THE G-4
JET SHOWS A 500 MB TROUGH EXTENDING INTO THE CENTRAL GULF.  THESE
DATA ALSO SHOW...HOWEVER..THAT EARL DOES NOT HAVE MUCH OF A
SIGNATURE AT THAT LEVEL...SUGGESTING A RATHER SHALLOW SYSTEM THAT
MAY NOT RESPOND TO DEEPER-LAYER STEERING.  

ALTHOUGH THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF DEEP CONVECTION...EARL DOES NOT
LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE IN TERMS OF ORGANIZATION ON SATELLITE IMAGES.
IN FACT...IT DOES NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE A TROPICAL STORM AT THIS TIME. 
THE STORM REMAINS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF WESTERLY SHEAR...AND THIS MAY
PREVENT ANY SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING BEFORE LANDFALL.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST STILL ACKNOWLEDGES THE CHANCE THAT EARL COULD REACH
HURRICANE STRENGTH BEFORE REACHING THE COAST.  IN ANY EVENT THERE IS
A FAIRLY LARGE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION WITH A BROAD AREA OF STRONG
WINDS MAINLY EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.

SAB SATELLITE FIXES ARE 110 NMI APART.  THE PAST 24 HOUR MOTION IS
030/10.  THE PAST 6 HOUR MOTION IS STATIONARY.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH
IS CLOSER TO BEING RIGHT.  THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL AND THE ETA SHOW
VERY SLOW NORTHEAST AND THEN NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR 48 HOURS...CUT
OFF FROM THE WESTERLIES.  THE NOGAPS AND UKMET ALSO SHOW VERY SLOW
MOTION FOR 72 HOURS.  IN CONTRAST...THE 00Z GFDL AND LBAR
ACCELERATES THE STORM NORTHEASTWARD...UNDER 10 KNOTS FOR 24 HOURS
THEN NEAR 20 KNOTS BY 48 HOURS...INDICATING EARL GETTING PICKED UP
BY WESTERLIES...BUT NOT REAL FAST.
 
THE OFFICIAL INITIAL MOTION FOR 09Z IS 045/08...A COMPROMISE AVERAGE
OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITES.  THE FORECAST TRACK CONTINUES THIS
FORWARD SPEED FOR 24 HOURS...OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE GFDL AND THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  AFTER 24 HOURS THE FORECAST IS A SLOW NORTHWARD
DRIFT...RESPECTING THE OTHER GUIDANCE.
 
GPS DROPS FROM THE GULFSTREAM AIRCRAFT EARLIER SHOWED A 500 MB
TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES WITH A POSSIBLE LOW JUST SOUTH OF EASTERN
LOUISIANA.  THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS SOUTHWEST OF THE 500 MB LOW.
THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE STRICTLY TROPICAL.  THE DEEPEST
CONVECTION IS IN TWO AREAS...ONE CDO TYPE NEAR THE CENTER AND THE
OTHER ELONGATED EAST OF THE CENTER.  THE MAXIMUM RECON WIND WAS 51
KNOTS AT 1500 FT AND BUOYS AND RIGS ALL SHOW THAT EARLY IS A 45 KNOT
STORM.  IT IS STILL WARM CORE AT 1500 FT HOWEVER AND...FOR ALL I
KNOW...INTENSIFICATION IS STILL POSSIBLE.  I AM RELUCTANT TO CHANGE
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TO REACH 65 KNOTS BEFORE LANDFALL EVEN THOUGH
IT MAY NOT BE THE MOST LIKELY POSSIBILITY.

WARNINGS ARE SHIFTED A LITTLE EASTWARD AS IS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK.

FORMING.
 
THE CENTER OF THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN ROTATING AROUND A MUCH LARGER
CIRCULATION MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE OVERALL INITIAL
MOTION. IT APPEARS THAT EARL HAS BEGUN TO MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST
ABOUT 8 KNOTS BUT THIS ALSO COULD ANOTHER EASTWARD SHIFT OR

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES WITH PERSISTENCE AND CONTINUES WITH A
GENERAL NORTHEASTWARD TRACK. THIS APPEARS TO BE THE BEST OPTION AT
THIS TIME.  ON THIS TRACK THE DIFFUSE CENTER WILL BE NEAR THE COAST
WITHIN THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 12 HOURS.  

DUE TO HIGH UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST...WATCHES AND WARNINGS
REMAIN UNCHANGED AT THIS TIME.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT WED SEP 02 1998
 
EARL CONTINUES TO HAVE A NON-CLASSICAL CLOUD PATTERN...TO SAY THE
LEAST.  ENHANCED INFRARED IMAGERY SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT OVERALL
WARMING OF THE CLOUD TOPS AND LESS ORGANIZATION...WHICH SUGGESTS
WEAKENING.  FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS AND DROPWINDSONDE DATA FROM THE AIR
FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS INDICATE THAT EARL HAS DROPPED BACK TO
CATEGORY ONE INTENSITY.  NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN INTENSITY IS
EXPECTED BEFORE LANDFALL.
 
STRONG WINDS EXTEND WELL OUT FROM THE CENTER OVER THE EASTERN
SEMICIRCLE.  THIS WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE A SERIOUS STORM SURGE
PROBLEM IN THE BIG BEND AREA OF FLORIDA.
 
THE RECON DATA SHOWS THAT THE CENTER REMAINS BROAD AND DIFFUSE...AND
FIXES FROM WSR-88D RADAR ARE RATHER POOR.  THIS CONTINUES TO MAKE IT
DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE INITIAL MOTION.  THE CURRENT ESTIMATE IS
060/09.  TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS HAVE NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR
PREDICTING EARL...SO EXTRAPOLATION OF THE CURRENT MOVEMENT IS A
PRIMARY FORECAST TOOL IN THIS CASE.  BASED ON A SLIGHTLY MORE
EASTWARD INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE...THE LATEST OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A
LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.  THE FORECAST BASICALLY
CONTINUES AN EAST-NORTHEASTWARD TO NORTHEASTWARD MOTION AT ABOUT THE
SAME SPEED FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

RADAR AND SURFACE DATA SHOW THE CENTER OF EARL ACCELERATING
NORTHEASTWARD THROUGH GEORGIA.  CURRENT MOTION IS 50 DEGREES AT
ABOUT 17 KT.  THEY ALSO SHOW A SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED CIRCULATION
...AND MAXIMUM WINDS ARE NOW ESTIMATED TO BE 40 KT...AND THESE ARE
PROBABLY LIMITED TO THUNDERSTORMS NEAR THE CENTER.  GUSTS TO
TROPICAL STORM FORCE ARE ALSO OCCURRING OVER THE ATLANTIC COASTAL
WATERS OFF GEORGIA.
 
THE CURRENT MOTION AND GUIDANCE HAVE LED TO A FORECAST MOTION THAT
IS CONSIDERABLY FASTER THAN 6 HOURS AGO.  THE TRACK OF THE CENTER IS
EXPECTED TO EMERGE OFF THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST IN 24 TO 36 HOURS. 
WEAKENING SHOULD CONTINUE IN THE INTERIM AND SUSTAINED WINDS ARE
EXPECTED TO DROP BELOW STORM STRENGTH TODAY.  THE SYSTEM CONTINUES
TO GRADUALLY LOSE ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND WE ARE
FORECASTING IT TO BE EXTRATROPICAL WHEN IT LEAVES THE COAST.  THAT
IS BY NO MEANS A CERTAINTY AND THE SYSTEM IS THEN LIKELY TO STILL
HAVE A STRONG CIRCULATION ALOFT.  THEREFORE...WHILE THIS IS INTENDED
TO BE THE FINAL ADVISORY ON EARL FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE
CENTER...WE WILL RESUME ADVISORIES IF THE SYSTEM AGAIN BECOMES A
COASTAL OR OFFSHORE THREAT AS A TROPICAL EVENT. 

UNTIL THEN...INFORMATION ON THIS SYSTEM WILL BE PROVIDED IN

LARGE BROAD CIRCULATION AND SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THERE IS
ENOUGH DEEP ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO CLASSIFY THE SYSTEM AS A

STAGES AND A CONSISTENT CENTER WILL LIKELY BE VERY DIFFICULT TO
TRACK.  BECAUSE MOST OF THE MODELS ARE RELAXING THE SHEAR...SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED.  THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO BECOME
A TROPICAL STORM BEFORE REACHING THE COAST.
 
THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO SLOWLY MOVE TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST AS
THE RIGDE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.  HOWEVER...THE

WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A VERY POORLY ORGANIZED LOW PRESSURE AREA IN
THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO.  IF THE SYSTEM HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN
DESIGNATED AS A DEPRESSION...I WOULD NOT DO SO AT THIS TIME.  BUOY
REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE CIRCULATION IS EVEN LESS WELL
ORGANIZED THAN SIX HOURS AGO.  WITH NO EVIDENCE OF ANY MOTION...THE
INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE STATIONARY.  THE MODEL GUIDANCE
SHOWS A SLOW WEST THROUGH NORTHWEST MOTION... DEPENDING ON THE
MODEL.  THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL LOCATES THE CENTER WELL SOUTH OF
WHERE WE HAVE IT...BUT THE AVIATION MODEL COULD TURN OUT TO BE
CORRECT.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...BUT ALONG THE SAME PATH REACHING THE TEXAS COAST IN 36
HOURS.
 
THE DEEP CONVECTION IS LOCATED WELL EAST AND SOUTH OF OUR CENTER.
PERHAPS THIS CONVECTION WILL ORGANIZE INTO A BANDING FEATURE WITH
TIME...BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS LITTLE ORGANIZATION AND NO SIGNS
OF DEVELOPMENT.  BUT THERE IS LITTLE VERTICAL SHEAR IN THE VICINITY

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT ALTHOUGH THE COVERAGE OF DEEP
CONVECTION HAS INCREASED TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIX IS STILL
DISORGANIZED.  THE LATEST RECONNAISSANCE DATA RECEIVED FROM THE 
AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE
CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIX REMAINS BROAD AND ILL-DEFINED. 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS FINALLY ABLE TO CLOSE OFF A CENTER BUT REPORTS AN
ACCURACY OF 45 NMI. MEANWHILE A RADAR CENTER FIX ESTIMATE FROM THE
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR IS ABOUT 100 MILES NORTHWEST
OF THE AIRCRAFT POSITION.  SO...WITH THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY
SURROUNDING THE EXACT CENTER LOCATION WE WILL USE THE SAME CENTER
POSITION FROM THE 06Z ADVISORY UNTIL A MORE DEFINITIVE CENTER
EMERGES.  

RECON DATA SHOWS THAT THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DROP 1 MB AND
IS NOW 998 MB.  MEANWHILE THE STRONGEST FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS...35-39
KNOTS...ARE 60-90 MILES NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  12Z BUOY AND SHIP
DATA CONTINUES TO SHOW 20 TO 30 KNOT WINDS...WITH NCDC BUOY 42002 IS
REPORTING A EAST-NORTHEAST WIND OF 22 KNOTS AND A 999.9 MB PRESSURE.

THE SYSTEM WILL BE HELD AT TROPICAL DEPRESSION STATUS...30 KNOTS...
WITH GUSTS TO 45 KNOTS.  THE INTENSITY TREND FROM THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE WILL BE MAINTAINED WITH THE SYSTEM FORECAST TO A TROPICAL
STORM WITHIN 12 HOURS. 

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS STATIONARY.  THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE
IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE 06Z SUITE SHOWING CONSIDERABLE SCATTER
ALTHOUGH THE CONSENSUS IS STILL WEST-NORTHWEST. THE GFDL...WHICH HAS
A LEFT BIAS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO... IS THE LEFT-MOST OF ALL THE
GUIDANCE SHOWING A SOUTHWEST HEADING.  THIS SEEMS INCONSISTENT WITH
THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN OF A MID-LEVEL NORTHWEST-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED
RIDGE.  DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE CENTER LOCATION THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE PACKAGE FROM 06Z.

THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PATH OF LEAST REGRET UNTIL WE CAN GET A MORE
CLEAR-CUT CENTER POSITION AND SUBSEQUENT MOTION.  THE TROPICAL STORM
WARNINGS REMAIN UNCHANGED.

THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR CORPUS CHRISTI RADAR 24-
HOUR RAINFALL TOTAL OF NEAR 6 INCHES BETWEEN CORPUS AND BROWNSVILLE.

AT 18Z BUOY 42019...LOCATED JUST OFF THE LOWER TEXAS COAST...
REPORTED SUSTAINED WINDS OF 35 KNOTS AT 3 METERS.  THE LAST AIR
FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT REPORTED FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS
OF 40 KNOTS IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT. BASED ON THIS DATA TROPICAL
DEPRESSION SIX IS BEING UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM FRANCES.
 
SEVERAL OIL RIG OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED 40 TO 50 KNOTS WINDS
...AT ABOUT 30 METERS...OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF...DURING THE DAY.
ALTHOUGH THESE STRONG WINDS A LIKELY DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING
OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND
RADII ENCOMPASS THESE WINDS.
 
POSITION ESTIMATES FROM RECONNAISSANCE...RADAR...AND SATELLITE
CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT THE CENTER OF THIS SYSTEM IS BROAD AND POORLY
DEFINED.  HIGH-RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST SEVERAL
VORTICES ARE ROTATING AROUND A LARGER CIRCULATION.  WHILE EARLIER
RECONNAISSANCE WAS ABLE TO FIX A CENTER...ALBEIT WITH 45 NM ACCURACY
...THEY WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE A CENTER ON THE LAST PASS.  WITH THE
OVERALL ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE FOR DEVELOPMENT..I.E. NO APPRECIABLE
WIND SHEAR AND 30C SST...THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP.  THERE
IS A DISTINCT POSSIBLITY THAT THE CENTER WILL REFORM SOUTH OF THE
ADVISORY POSITION.  THUS... WITH THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY
SURROUNDING THE EXACT CENTER LOCATION WE WILL HOLD THE POSITION FROM
THE 12Z ADVISORY UNTIL A MORE DEFINITIVE CENTER EMERGES. THE
INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS SOME GRADUAL STRENGTHENING ALTHOUGH THIS
IS HIGHLY DEPENDANT ON WHERE/IF THE CENTER IS.
 
THE SYSTEM REMAINS STATIONARY.  THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES
TO SHOW HIGHLY DIVERGENT SOLUTIONS.  THE EXTREMES ARE CLIPER WHICH
BRINGS THE SYSTEM NORTH-NORTHEAST WHILE THE GFDL HOOKS FRANCES
SOUTHWEST.  THE MAJORITY OF THE GUIDANCE IS STILL WEST-NORTHWEST
WITH SEVERAL MODELS NOW SHOWING A MORE NORTHWEST HEADING.  THE
GFDL...ALONG WITH THE NGM...SHOWS FRANCES ROTATING SOUTH/SOUTHWEST
ALONG THE MEXICAN COAST. EXAMINATION OF THE LOWER RESOLUTION FIELDS
SUGGEST THAT THE GFDL IS TRACKING A SMALL-SCALE CENTER WITHIN A
LARGER CIRCULATION.  THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN OF A MID-LEVEL NORTHWEST-
SOUTHEAST ORIENTED RIDGE SUPPORTS A GENERALLY WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION.
DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE CENTER LOCATION THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS IDENTICAL TO THE PACKAGE FROM 12Z. THIS SEEMS TO
BE THE PATH OF LEAST REGRET UNTIL WE CAN GET A MORE CLEAR-CUT CENTER
POSITION AND SUBSEQUENT MOTION.
 
BASED ON THE SIZE OF FRANCES THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO HAS ISSUED A
TROPICAL STORM WARNING FROM THE TEXAS/MEXICAN BORDER TO TAMPICO

FRANCES CONSISTS OF A VERY LARGE CYCLONIC GYRE SURROUNDED BY A RING
OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS...WITHOUT A DEFINITIVE TIGHT CENTER.
THIS PATTERN RESEMBLES A MONSOON-TYPE GYRE WHICH IS NOT COMMON IN
THE ATLANTIC BUT IS FREQUENTLY OBSERVED OVER THE WESTERN PACIFIC.
 
AN AIR FORCE PLANE JUST FOUND A CENTER OF 994 MB TO THE SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS POSITION AND BY NO MEANS THIS IS TRANSLATED INTO A
SOUTHWARD MOTION OF THE STORM.  THIS IS BASICALLY A REFORMATION AND
APPEARS TO BE THE DOMINANT AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...SINCE THE
CIRCULATION IS LARGE.. OTHER CENTERS MAY FORM WHILE FRANCES IS IN
FORMATIVE STAGE.  THE CIRCULATION OF FRANCES IS TRYING TO BECOME
MORE CONCENTRATED AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES RISE AND THE
CENTRAL PRESSURE OF THE STORM FALLS.  AN UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS
BECOMING ESTABLISHED OVER THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF OUTFLOW
JETS.  THEREFORE...A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED AND IN
FACT...AN OIL RIG LOCATED ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL AND TO
THE NORTHEAST OF FRANCES JUST REPORTED A GUST TO 83 MPH.  OTHER RIGS
ARE REPORTING GUSTS AROUND 70 MPH.
 
WE SHOULD NOT CONCENTRATE IN THE BROAD CENTER OF FRANCES. INSTEAD
...WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE RING OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS AND
HEAVY RAINS WHICH SURROUNDS THE STORM. THIS ACTIVITY IS ALREADY
AFFECTING THE COASTAL SECTIONS WITHIN THE WARNING AREA AS WELL AS
MUCH OF THE GULF OF MEXICO.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS BRING FRANCES
TOWARD NORTHEASTERN MEXICO IN ABOUT 24 HOURS IN RESPONSE TO A
BUILDING HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND THE
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT KEEPS
FRANCES NEARLY STATIONARY FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS AND THEN MOVES THE

11 AM EDT THU SEP 10 1998
 
TRACKING OF THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE HAS BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE.  THE
CENTER HAS CONTINUED TO REFORM WITHIN A BROADER SCALE CIRCULATION
ENVELOPE...AND ALTHOUGH LATEST CENTER FIXES ARE MORE TO THE NORTH
THIS IS NOT BELIEVED TO REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NORTHWARD
COMPONENT OF MOTION.  IN FACT...THE OVERALL AREA OF PRECIPITATION ON
RADAR APPEARS TO BE SPREADING GENERALLY WESTWARD ACROSS SOUTH TEXAS.
THE STEERING CURRENTS ARE STILL NOT VERY WELL DEFINED...BUT THE NCEP
GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE AN EAST-SOUTHEASTERLY STEERING FLOW TO THE
SOUTH OF A LARGE 500 MB HIGH OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. SO A SLOW
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION TOWARD EXTREME SOUTH TEXAS IS FORECAST.
 
OVERALL THE CYCLONE LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER-ORGANIZED THAN IT DID 24
HOURS AGO.  FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH OF
A CONCENTRATION OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE AREA OF LOWEST PRESSURE. 
RECENT SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW MORE HEAVY SHOWERS FORMING NEAR THE
ESTIMATED CENTER AND IF THIS TREND CONTINUES... STRENGTHENING COULD
OCCUR SINCE THE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT IS ANTICYCLONIC AND THE
VERTICAL SHEAR IS NOT STRONG.

THE STORM CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT A BROAD CENTRAL AREA OF ABOUT EQUAL
PRESSURE...LIGHT WINDS...AND SMALLER-SCALE VORTICES EVIDENT ON HIGH-
RES VISIBLE IMAGERY.  AS SUCH IT IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE A UNIQUE
CENTER.  BUT...AS MENTIONED EARLIER...THE STORM HAS BECOME A LITTLE
BETTER-ORGANIZED AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.  MAXIMUM SUSTAINED
SURFACE WINDS ARE NOW ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 50 KNOTS...WELL NORTHEAST
OF THE CENTER.  RECENTLY...AN OIL RIG NEAR 28N92W REPORTED SUSTAINED
WINDS OF 68 KNOTS WITH GUSTS TO 77 KNOTS MORE THAN 100 FEET ABOVE
SEA LEVEL.  THERE IS AN IMPRESSIVE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE
OVER THE SYSTEM AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS ANALYSES SHOW
LOW VERTICAL SHEAR OVER THE AREA.  FURTHER STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR
BEFORE LANDFALL.
 
EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CENTER SHIFTS OR REFORMATIONS TO
THE NORTH...MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES A MORE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TO
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION.  THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS A 500
MB HIGH PERSISTING NEAR AND TO NORTHEAST OF TEXAS...PROVIDING A WEAK
EAST TO SOUTHEASTERLY STEERING CURRENT.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW FRANCES
TO MOVE INLAND SLOWLY OVER SOUTHERN TEXAS WITHIN IN A DAY OR SO.
 
TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS WERE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THE LOUISIANA COAST
BECAUSE OF THE STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT IN THAT AREA.  IF THE
STRENGTHENING TREND CONTINUES...A HURRICANE WARNING MAY BE REQUIRED
LATER TONIGHT OR EARLY FRIDAY.

FRANCES LOOKS MORE LIKE A TROPICAL STORM ON SATELLITE TONIGHT THAN
ANY OTHER TIME BEFORE.  THERE IS A CONCENTRATED AREA OF STRONG
SQUALLS JUST TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER WHERE DOPPLER WINDS
ALOFT HAVE REACH 70 KNOTS. RECON JUST FOUND A BROAD 995 MB PRESSURE
CENTER AND 59-KNOT WINDS.

MOST OF THE SEVERE WEATHER HAS ALREADY REACHED THE MID TO UPPER
TEXAS COAST AND THESE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PERSIST FOR A FEW
MORE HOURS AND GRADUALLY SPREAD INLAND.  THE UPPER LEVEL ENVIRONMENT
IS FAVORABLE FOR INTENSIFICATION BUT MUCH OF THE CIRCULATION IS
ALREADY OVER LAND.  THEREFORE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS
EXPECTED BEFORE THE CENTER REACHES THE COAST WITHIN 12 HOURS OR SO.
 
FRANCES IS STILL MEANDERING BUT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS EXPECTED TO
MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST ABOUT 5 KNOTS. THIS GENERAL MOTION IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS THE 500 MB
RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THIS IS SUGGESTED
BY MOST OF THE MODELS...ALTHOUGH THE SPEED VARIES AMONG THE MODELS.
 
SEVERE FLOODING FROM STORM SURGE AND RAIN IS OCCURRING ALONG THE MID
TO UPPER TEXAS COAST. DETAILS ARE INCLUDED IN STATEMENTS FROM LOCAL
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE FORECAST OFFICES. ONCE FRANCES MAKES
LANDFALL...A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS INDICATED BUT VERY HEAVY RAINS AND
FLOODING ARE EXPECTED OVER A LARGE PORTION OF TEXAS DURING THE NEXT
FEW DAYS DUE TO THE SLOW MOTION OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.

RADAR AND RECON DATA SHOWED THE CENTER OF FRANCES MAKING LANDFALL
BETWEEN PORT ARANSAS AND PORT OCONNOR AROUND 06Z.  THE CENTER HAS
PROGRESSED INLAND DURING THE FOLLOWING FEW HOURS ON A HEADING OF
ABOUT 315 DEGREES AT AROUND 12 KT.  WHILE THE WINDS NEAR THE CENTER
SHOULD ABATE...THE OFFSHORE CONDITIONS WILL BE IMPROVING RATHER
SLOWLY.
 
NUMERICAL GUIDANCE FROM LARGE-SCALE MODELS AND TRACK PREDICTION
SCHEMES GENERALLY SHOW A CONTINUATION OF THIS MOTION FOR THE NEXT
24-36 HOURS WITH SOME DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED...AS DOES THE
NHC FORECAST.  THEREAFTER...THERE IS DIVERGENCE WITH SOME MODELS
TAKING THE REMNANTS TOWARD THE NORTH AND OTHERS SUGGESTING A DUE
WESTWARD HEADING.  ON THIS FORECAST CYCLE...NONE OF THE GUIDANCE
SHOWS THE SYSTEM STALLING...BUT THE DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED COULD
NEVERTHELESS INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING OVER SOUTH-CENTRAL
TEXAS OVER THE WEEKEND.
 
FLOODING FROM STORM SURGE IS LIKELY TO SLOWLY DIMINISH DURING THE
DAY NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER AND DECREASE MORE QUICKLY TO THE
SOUTHEAST.  DETAILS ARE CONTAINED IN STATEMENTS FROM LOCAL NATIONAL

THE SURFACE CIRCULATION APPEARS TO HAVE BECOME ELONGATED...AS THE
SATELLITE AND RADAR CENTERS ARE WELL WEST OF WHERE SURFACE
OBSERVATIONS FROM VICTORIA TEXAS WOULD PLACE THE CENTER.  SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOWS FRANCES TO BE LOCATED NEAR THE END OF A LARGE SCALE
AND WELL DEFINED FRONTAL ZONE.  PERHAPS FRANCES IS EVOLVING INTO A
WAVE ON A FRONT.  THIS COULD KEEP THE CIRCULATION VIGOROUS FOR SOME
TIME LONGER...AND KEEP THE THREAT OF HEAVY RAIN INLAND FOR LONGER.

THE SABINE C-MAN REPORTED 41 KNOTS AT 12Z AND 31 KNOTS AT 13Z AND 35
KNOTS AT 14Z.  THE WIND IS KEPT AT 35 KNOTS FOR 15Z...BUT WE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO DOWNGRADE FRANCES TO A DEPRESSION AT 18Z AND TAKE DOWN
THE COASTAL WARNINGS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS SLOWED TO 300/07 BECAUSE OF THE
UNCERTAINTY IN THE LOCATION DISCUSSED ABOVE.  THE MODELS ALL SHOW A
SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION FOR 48 HOURS.  THE AVIATION
MODEL AND UKMET AND LBAR SHOW THE SYSTEM MOVING NORTHWARD AFTER 48
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
FOR 48 HOURS AND THEN ADDS THE NORTHWARD MOTION.

THE BROAD CENTER OF THE DEPRESSION HAS BEEN MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS. MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS
SUGGEST THAT THE LOW PRESSURE AREA...REMNANTS OF FRANCES SHOULD MOVE
ON A GENERAL NORTHWARD TRACK AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. 

THE SYSTEM IS GRADUALLY WEAKENING BUT SOME ISOLATED WIND GUSTS OF
TROPICAL STORM FORCE MAY STILL OCCUR OVER WATER WITHIN SOME OF THE
RAINBANDS.  THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE HEAVY RAINS
PRIMARILY OVER EASTERN TEXAS DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY ON FRANCES ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL

SATELLITE LOOPS INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM MOVES SOUTH OF DUE WEST
SINCE YESTERDAY. HOWEVER... A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK IS EXPECTED
THROUGH 72 HOURS SINCE A MID-LEVEL RIDGE IS BUILDING WESTWARD WITH
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LIMITED INITIAL

NO METEOSAT IMAGERY RECEIVED FROM 23Z THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF THIS
FORECAST...BUT AVAILABLE CENTER FIXES WERE A LITTLE TO THE NORTH OF
THE EXPECTED POSITION AND IMPLY A SOMEWHAT SLOWER MOTION THAN
EXPECTATIONS BASED ON THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS AND SHORT-TERM FORECAST.

AS A COMPROMISE...THE INITIAL POSITION HAS BEEN EASED NORTHWARD A
BIT AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 275/15 KT.  THE
SYSTEM RETAINS A SMALL AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND
AN AREA OF THUNDERSTORMS MORE DISTANT TO THE NW.  THE DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES HAVE NOT CHANGED FROM 6 HOURS AGO.  A 01Z
PICTURE RECEIVED JUST BEFORE RELEASE OF THIS ADVISORY SHOWS A MORE
DEVELOPED AND CIRCULAR CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST PATTERN.
 
THE TRACK MODELS ARE FAIRLY CLOSELY CLUSTERED...GENERALLY INDICATING
A WESTWARD...BECOMING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS. 
THE NHC FORECAST IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLUSTER AND A LITTLE TO THE
RIGHT OF THE OFFICIAL TRACK IN THE FIRST ADVISORY.  THIS TRACK
ASSUMES THAT A NARROWING E-W RIDGE TO THE NORTH WILL HOLD...EVEN
WITH THE LARGE TROUGH THAT THE 18Z AVN AND 12Z NOGAPS SHOW
GENERATING WESTERLIES AT 500 MB ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 25-30N OVER MUCH

DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION SEVEN...
WHICH HAD BEEN WANING EARLIER THIS MORNING...HAS MADE A COMEBACK 
PER THE LAST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES. DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES 
FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN 2.0 AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE 
HELD AT 30 KNOTS.
 
THE SYSTEM HAS A LARGE ENVELOPE AND REMAINS FAIRLY WELL ORGANIZED. 
RECENT SATELLITE PICTURES INDICATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BANDING
FEATURE SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER.  THE OUTFLOW IS BECOMING BETTER
ESTABLISHED OVER THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE DEPRESSION WHILE STILL
RESTRICTED TO THE EAST.  WITH SUFFICIENTLY WARM SST/S...28C...AND
ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE
STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SHOWING A LIGHT VERTICAL
SHEAR ENVIRONMENT AHEAD CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR CONTINUED
DEVELOPMENT.  THUS...GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY
PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS. THIS BRINGS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO
HURRICANE STATUS BY 72 HOURS.
 
THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES TO MOVE WESTWARD AT A FAIRLY GOOD CLIP WITH
AN INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE OF 275/16 KNOTS.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE
NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION SHOULD CONTINUE TO STEER THE SYSTEM ON A
GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING THROUGH THE 72 HOURS AS THE WESTERLIES
ASSOCIATED WITH THE LARGE-SCALE TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC
REMAIN NORTH OF 25N...PER THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL OUTPUT. MEANWHILE 
THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL HAS THE TROUGH SLIGHTLY DEEPER RESULTING IN A
WEAKER RIDGE AND A MORE WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.  ITS INTERESTING
TO NOTE THAT THE 00Z UNITED KINGDOM MET OFFICE MODEL LOSES THE
SYSTEM AFTER 24 HOURS WHEREAS THE 15/12Z RUN HELD ON TO THE SYSTEM
THROUGH 72 HOURS.  MOST OF THE 06Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS CLUSTERED
AROUND A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLUSTER AND IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE

WEATHER CENTER IS 3.0. THIS IS THE BASIS FOR UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO
A TROPICAL STORM AT THIS TIME. GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO FORECAST
200 MB EASTERLIES OVER THE DEEP TROPICS AND BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL
BRING THE SYSTEM TO HURRICANE STATUS BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING AND MAKES GEORGES A 70-KNOT HURRICANE BY 72 HOURS.

INITIAL MOTION IS 275/17. THERE IS A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE ANCHORED

FORECAST WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST BEYOND 48 HOURS.
THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH TRACK MODELS PRIMARILY THE GDFL...LBAR AND

ONE SHOULD MENTION THAT THE AVN DEVELOPS A TROPICAL CYCLONE WELL
AHEAD OF GEORGES AND THIS MODEL FEATURE ERODES THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE CURRENTLY STEERING GEORGES. THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE DEVELOPMENT

THE IR IMAGES THIS EVENING SHOW TWO PERSISTENT CLUSTERS OF STRONG
CONVECTION...OCCASIONALLY WITH CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES LOWER THAN
-80C.  THE CENTER IS ESTIMATED TO BE LOCATED BETWEEN THE CLUSTERS.
OUTFLOW ON THE WEST SIDE REMAINS PARTICULARLY WELL-DEVELOPED AND...
WITH DVORAK T-NUMBERS NOW AT 3.0...THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 45
KT.
 
THE MOTION REMAINS JUST NORTH OF DUE WEST AT ABOUT 17 KT...TO THE
SOUTH OF A HIGH DETECTED IN WV IMAGERY.  THE LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE
SUGGESTS THAT THE SHORTWAVE TROUGHS FARTHER TO THE NORTH WILL
CONTINUE BYPASSING GEORGES WITH LITTLE IMPACT ON THE TRACK OF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE AT LEAST INTO THE WEEKEND.  AS INDICATED BY THE
GFDL AND AVN OUTPUT FROM 18Z AND THE NOGAPS FROM 12Z...ONLY A SLOW
ROTATION OF THE HEADING FROM WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED OVER
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE TRACK GIVEN IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST FROM 6 HOURS AGO.
 
THE GFDL AND SHIPS INTENSITY FORECASTS BRING GEORGES TO HURRICANE
STRENGTH IN ABOUT 36 HOURS WITH FURTHER STRENGTHENING THEREAFTER. 
THE NHC FORECAST IMPLIES A LITTLE SLOWER RATE OF INTENSIFICATION.

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY DURING THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS SHOWS THAT
THE TWO PREVIOUSLY SEPARATE CLUSTERS OF DEEP CONVECTION LOCATED ON
EITHER SIDE OF THE CENTER HAVE MERGED.  THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN
HAS IMPROVED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS WITH THE EXPANSION OF DEEP
CONVECTION AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE.  CLOUD-DRIFT WIND DATA SUGGESTS THAT EASTERLY SHEAR
IS HINDERING THE OUTFLOW DEVELOPMENT OVER EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE
SYSTEM.  DVORAK CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.
REMAIN 45 KNOTS...AS WILL THE INITIAL INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY.
 
GLOBAL MODEL OUTPUT SUGGEST THAT CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE FOR
CONTINUED INTENSIFICATION AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS GEORGES
TO HURRICANE STATUS BY 36 HOURS...WITH FURTHER STRENGTHENING
THEREAFTER.  THIS IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS.
 
SATELLITE FIXES INDICATE THAT GEORGES CONTINUES TO MOVE JUST NORTH
OF DUE WEST AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 275/17 KNOTS.
THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF GEORGES SHOULD CONTINUE STEERING THE
SYSTEM ON A GENERAL WESTWARD COURSE THROUGH 36 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL
TURN TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST THEREAFTER.  GEORGES IS EXPECTED TO
REMAIN FAR ENOUGH SOUTH THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD TO LESSEN THE
INFLUENCE OF THE LARGE-SCALE CENTRAL ATLANTIC TROUGH.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH CLIPER AND LBAR...AND IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

A SEQUENCE OF SSMI IMAGES DURING THE LAST 12 HOURS...COURTESY OF NRL
MONTEREY HOMEPAGE...INDICATE THAT THE INNER CORE OF GEORGES IS
GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED. THESE IMAGES REVEAL THAT THERE
IS ALMOST A CLOSED EYEWALL.  THIS COINCIDES WITH EARLIER VISIBLE
METEOSAT IMAGES THAT SUGGESTED AN EYE WAS TRYING TO FORM BUT
CONVECTION DOES NOT SUPPORT SUCH FEATURE.  IN FACT...THE APPARENT
EYE IS NO LONGER CLEARLY OBSERVED AND T-NUMBERS REMAIN ABOUT 3.0 ON
THE DVORAK SCALE.  ALL OF THE ABOVE JUSTIFIES THAT THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS AT LEAST 50 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  THE AVAILABLE GLOBAL
MODELS MAINTAIN A 200 MB HIGH WITH EASTERLIES OVER THE DEEP TROPICS
THROUGH 72 HOURS.  SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL BRINGS GEORGES TO
86 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS AND THE GFDL ALSO STRENGTHENS THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO HURRICANE STATUS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
SHIPS BRINGING GEORGES TO 85 KNOTS BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  IF THE EYE DEVELOPS DURING THE DAY...GEORGES MAY BE
UPGRADED TO HURRICANE STATUS SOONER THAN ANTICIPATED. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 275/17. A DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. THIS PATTERN SUPPORTS
A CONTINUED MOTION SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST THROUGH THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THIS IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY GFDL...LBAR AND UK MODELS.

NOTE: 5-DAY GFDL AND LBAR BRING GEORGES OVER THE NORTHEASTERN

THE HEADING IS 280/16 KT WHICH IS A DECREASE FROM 24 HOURS AGO WHERE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SAT SEP 19 1998

RECONNAISSANCE PLANE FOUND FLIGHT-LEVEL PEAK WINDS OF 146 KNOTS NEAR
IN THE EYEWALL. A DROP IN THE EYEWALL JUST MEASURED 119 KNOTS WHICH
IS AN AVERAGE OVER THE LOWEST 2000 FEET OR SO. THEREFORE...INITIAL
INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 125 KNOTS. THIS MATCHES WITH THE OBJECTIVE
DVORAK T-NUMBERS WHICH HAVE BEEN OSCILLATING BETWEEN 6.0 AND 6.5. 
SOME FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS POSSIBLE BUT INTENSITY MAY FLUCTUATE
AS THE HURRICANE INTERACTS WITH THE ISLANDS LATER IN THE FORECAST
PERIOD.. 

THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN MOVING 290/17 KNOTS. MOST OF THE MODELS HAVE
A 500MB RIDGE ANCHORED TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE WHICH IS
FORECAST TO PERSIST OR STRENGTHEN.  THIS RIDGE COULD FORCE THE
HURRICANE ON A MORE WESTERLY TRACK AS INDICATED BY LBAR...BAMD AND
THE RELIABLE GFDL. HOWEVER..SINCE NOGPAS AND THE UKMET MODELS ARE
CONSISTENTLY TAKING GEORGE ON A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...AND THE
CURRENT INITIAL MOTION IS 290 DEGREES...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
HAS BEEN ADJUSTED A LITTLE TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACK. THIS MOTION BRINGS THE HURRICANE OVER THE LEEWARD ISLANDS IN
ABOUT 24 HOURS AND NEAR PUERTO RICO WITHIN 48 HOUR OR SO. 
 
A KEY PLAYER COULD BE AN UPPER LOW OVER HISPANIOLA. MODELS WEAKEN
THE LOW RAPIDLY OR MOVE IT SOUTHWESTWARD BUT THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF
EITHER AT THIS TIME. IF THE LOW REMAINS...A MORE NORTHERLY COMPONENT
SHOULD RESULT.

THE PRESSURE WAS DROPPING RAPIDLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THE
AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL
PROBLEMS.  HOWEVER...A NOAA PLANE RECENTLY REPORTED 939 MB SO IT
APPEARS THAT THE RAPID DEEPENING MAY HAVE CEASED FOR NOW.  ANOTHER
AIR FORCE PLANE IS SCHEDULED INTO GEORGES AROUND 0600Z.  CURRENT
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A DISTINCT EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN VERY COLD
CONVECTIVE TOPS.  TAFB...SAB...AND KGWC DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM
0000Z WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT WITH A T6.5...127 KNOTS.  THE MOST
RECENT OBJECTIVE T NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE HIGHER. ONE OF THE GPS
DROPWINDSONDES ACTUALLY REPORTED 166 KNOTS AT LOW LEVELS IN THE
EYEWALL...BUT ONE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE SURFACE WINDS WILL BE
SOMEWHAT LESS.  THE ESTIMATE OF SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS IS NOW 130
KNOTS.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY OCCUR OVER THE NEXT 24
HOURS...BUT GEORGES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN A SOLID CATEGORY FOUR
HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR/SIMPSON HURRICANE SCALE.  THE WEAKENING
INDICATED NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD IS DUE TO INVOLVEMENT
WITH HISPANIOLA.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS STILL SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST...NEAR 16 KNOTS. 
THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY OVER HAITI IS FORECAST TO MOVE
WESTWARD AND NOT BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR.  THE STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE
TO THE NORTH OF GEORGES WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE TRACK.  OUR TRACK
IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS IN BEST
AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL AND LBAR.  THE UKMET AND NAVY NOGAPS ARE TO
THE RIGHT...WHILE THE MID AND DEEP LAYER BAMS AS WELL AS NHC98 ARE
TO THE LEFT.  THE NOAA JET AND THE TWO NOAA P-3 AIRCRAFT ARE FLYING
IN THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND GEORGES TO HELP INITIALIZE THE 0000Z MODEL
RUNS.
 
ONE BIG CHANGE SINCE THE ADDITION OF RECONNAISSANCE DATA HAS BEEN IN
THE SIZE OF THE CIRCULATION.  THE HURRICANE AND TROPICAL STORM FORCE
WIND RADII HAVE BEEN INCREASED CONSIDERABLY BASED ON THE MOST RECENT
ANALYSIS BY THE HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION WHICH INCORPORATES DATA
FROM AIRCRAFT...SATELLITE...AND SHIPS.  BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN
SIZE...MARTINIQUE AND ST LUCIA HAVE ISSUED A TROPICAL STORM WARNING.

A NEW RECON FIX AT 08Z GIVES AN INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE OF 280/15
OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS.  THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL INITIALIZES A TROUGH
BETWEEN BARBADOS AND THE HURRICANE.  THIS RESULTS IN THE AVIATION
MODEL TURNING THE HURRICANE DUE NORTHWARD.  THE INITIALIZATION IS
PROBABLY INCORRECT IN THAT THE NORTH-NORTHEAST 500 MB WIND AT
BARBADOS IS PROBABLY PART OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE HURRICANE RATHER
THAN A SEPARATE TROUGH.
 
THE UKMET AND NOGAPS BOTH SHOW A TRACK NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.
THE GFDL MODEL HAS SHIFTED CONSIDERABLY NORTH OF ITS PREVIOUS RUN
AND NOW SHOWS A 72-HOUR POSITION JUST NORTH OF THE DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS CONSERVATIVELY SHIFTED
ABOUT 100 MILES NORTH AT 72 HOURS AND SMALLER DISTANCES AT THE
SHORTER FORECAST PERIODS...AND IS ABOUT HALF-WAY BETWEEN THE GFDL
MODEL AND THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  
 
THE LATEST CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED FROM AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE
WAS 939 MB AND THE HIGHEST WIND SO FAR WAS 132 KNOTS NEAR THE
SURFACE FROM A GPS DROP IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT AND 146 KNOTS AT
FLIGHT LEVEL IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS
UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY CALLING FOR LITTLE CHANGE
EXCEPT SLIGHT WEAKENING AT 72 HOURS.

11 AM EDT SUN SEP 20 1998

SINCE LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THE MOTION HAS BEEN MOSTLY TOWARD 280
DEGREES...I.E. JUST SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST.  FORWARD SPEED HAS
SLOWED A LITTLE MORE...TO NEAR 14 KNOTS.  THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL SHOW A GRADUAL WEAKENING OF THE 500 MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF
THE CARIBBEAN WITH SOME RETROGRESSION TOWARD THE WEST IN 2 TO 3
DAYS.   WITH THIS EVOLUTION OF THE STEERING FLOW...SOME FURTHER
SLOWING OF FORWARD SPEED APPEARS LIKELY DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
NOT MUCH OF A NORTHWARD TURN IS LIKELY IN THE FIRST PART OF THE
PERIOD...SINCE MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGING SHOULD BE STRONG
OVER THE AREA DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE EXCEPT A BIT SLOWER.  THIS
IS ALSO VERY CLOSE TO THE TRAJECTORY OF THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN. 
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE GFDL TRACK SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY
TO THE NORTH AFTER THE ADDITION OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA FROM A
SYNOPTIC FLOW EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED YESTERDAY EVENING WITH THREE NOAA
AIRCRAFT.  HOWEVER...IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER A MORE NORTHWARD
TREND WILL MATERIALIZE IN THE LONGER-RANGE...BEYOND 3 DAYS...TRACK
OF THIS HURRICANE.

AN ELONGATED UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE/TROUGH THAT WAS IN THE VICINITY OF
HISPANIOLA YESTERDAY HAS SHIFTED WESTWARD AROUND 5 DEGREES.  IT IS
NOT CLEAR WHAT ROLE THIS FEATURE WILL PLAY...BUT IF IT CUTS OFF INTO
A SMALLER-SCALE CYCLONE OVER THE CARIBBEAN THIS COULD LESSEN THE
POSSIBILITY OF A MORE NORTHWARD TRACK FOR GEORGES. 

THE EYE HAS BECOME A LITTLE LESS DISTINCT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS
AND THE DEEP CONVECTION IS NOT QUITE AS SYMMETRICAL AROUND THE
CENTER AS IT WAS EARLIER.  NONETHELESS...THE HURRICANE REMAINS QUITE
FORMIDABLE AND THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS STILL AROUND 130
KNOTS.  ASIDE FROM FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MECHANISMS SUCH AS
EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS
ANTICIPATED UNTIL GEORGES INTERACTS WITH THE LARGER ISLANDS.

ON SATELLITE IMAGES...GEORGES IS NOT AS IMPRESSIVE-LOOKING AS IT WAS
YESTERDAY.  THERE IS NO EYE AND THE COLD CLOUD TOPS ARE NOT VERY
SYMMETRICALLY ARRANGED ABOUT THE CENTER.  RECON SHOWS A HIGHER
CENTRAL PRESSURE THAN EARLY THIS MORNING BUT RECENTLY REPORTED 129
KNOTS AT THE 700 MB FLIGHT LEVEL...AND GEORGES IS STILL A VERY
DANGEROUS HURRICANE.  THERE ARE NO OBVIOUSLY UNFAVORABLE SIGNS IN
THE ENVIRONMENT...SO IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THIS HURRICANE
WILL RESTRENGTHEN DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  SOME WEAKENING COULD
OCCUR IF GEORGES INTERACTS WITH THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF THE
LARGER ISLANDS SUCH AS PUERTO RICO AND HISPANIOLA.

INITIAL MOTION IS ABOUT THE SAME...SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WEST NEAR 14
KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS MOSTLY AN EXTENSION OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE.  ONE OF THE PRIMARY STEERING MECHANISMS IS A MID-TO
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE THAT IS CURRENTLY BETWEEN 20N-30N TO THE
NORTH OF THE HURRICANE.  THIS RIDGE WILL LIKELY BE MAINTAINED DURING
THE FIRST HALF OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...KEEPING GEORGES ON A WEST TO
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD COURSE.   ACCORDING TO THE 12Z NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
RUN...THIS RIDGE IS PREDICTED TO SHIFT WEST-SOUTHWESTWARD LATER IN
THE PERIOD.  AS USUAL THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THE 48-
AND 72-HOURS POSITIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE 500 MB RIDGE OVER THE EXTREME
SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC IS FORECAST TO BE WEAKER IN 2 TO 3
DAYS...THERE MAY BE ENOUGH UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONIC FLOW TO
MAINTAIN THE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION.  ON THE OTHER HAND...3 DAYS
AND BEYOND...THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW SOME AMPLIFICATION OF A DEEP-
LAYER/MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH NEAR AND JUST OFFSHORE OF THE U.S.
EAST COAST WITH WESTERLIES SAGGING THROUGH 30N LATITUDE.  THUS IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT A MORE NORTHWARD COURSE COULD DEVELOP NEAR THE END OF
THE PERIOD...BUT THIS IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE.  IT IS SIMPLY TOO
EARLY TO SPEAK WITH ANY CONFIDENCE ABOUT A THREAT TO THE MAINLAND
U.S. AT THIS TIME.

THE MET OFFICE IN GUADELOUPE HAS FORWARDED THE 01Z OBSERVATION FROM
DESIRADE WHICH REPORTED SUSTAINED WINDS OF 57 KNOTS WITH A GUSTS TO
76 KNOTS.  THE LATEST DATA RECEIVED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE
HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT GEORGES HAS CONTINUED TO
WEAKEN THIS EVENING WITH THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAVING RISEN TO
966 MB. THIS REPRESENTS A 25 MB INCREASE DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS.
THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS DURING THE LAST PASS WAS 114 KNOTS.
SATELLITE IMAGERY CONFIRMS THE WEAKENING TREND WITH THE COLD CLOUD
TOPS REMAINING ASYMMETRIC AND THE STRONGEST CONVECTION IN THE
NORTHWEST QUADRANT OF THE CYCLONE.  BASED ON THIS DATA...THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 100 KNOTS...KEEPING GEORGES A CATEGORY THREE
HURRICANE THAT IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE
IS RESTRICTED.  EXAMINATION OF WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...ALONG WITH
ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE
STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN...SUGGESTS THAT NORTH/
NORTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN IS ONE OF THE POSSIBLE
CULPRITS RESPONSIBLE FOR GEORGES WEAKENING.  SOME OF THE GLOBAL
MODELS SHOW THAT THE SHEAR SHOULD RELAX SOMEWHAT AS THE SYSTEM MOVES
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD WHICH COULD ALLOW FOR SOME RE-INTENSIFICATION. ON
THE OTHER HAND...THE SYSTEM MAY WEAKEN MORE AS IT INTERACTS WITH THE
LARGER ISLANDS...I.E. PUERTO RICO AND HISPANIOLA. THEREFORE...GIVEN
THIS UNCERTAINTY THE FORECAST MAINTAINS GEORGES INTENSITY AT 100
KNOTS THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS UNCHANGED AT 285/14 KNOTS.
THE STEERING OF THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL DEPEND UPON THE STRENGTH
OF THE MID-TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE CURRENTLY LOCATED BETWEEN
20N-30N NORTH. THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY. THE GFDL MODEL IS TO THE LEFT OF OUR TRACK WHILE
THE UKMET IS WELL TO THE RIGHT.  THERE IS STILL CONSIDERABLE
UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING THE THREAT TO THE MAINLAND U.S. AT THIS TIME.

RAPID DEEPENING IS UNLIKELY BEFORE THE EYEWALL REACHES PUERTO RICO.
THERE IS STILL A HINT OF NORTHWESTERLY SHEAR OVER THE AREA...BUT
THIS APPEARS TO BE LESSENING.  LATEST ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN CIMSS SHOW VERTICAL SHEAR MOSTLY LESS THAN 20 KNOTS
ALONG THE PROJECTED PATH OF THE HURRICANE.  OTHERWISE THE ONLY
IMPEDIMENTS TO STRENGTHENING ARE THE LAND MASSES OF THE GREATER
ANTILLES...THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE BEING HISPANIOLA.  

USING RECON FIXES...AND SMOOTHING OUT THE TROCHOIDAL WOBBLES FROM
RADAR...GIVES A CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE OF 285/14 WHICH IS ABOUT THE
SAME AS BEFORE.  THE LATEST GLOBAL MODEL RUNS FROM 12Z SHOW LITTLE
EVIDENCE THAT THE DEEP-LAYER RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF GEORGES WILL GIVE
WAY ENOUGH TO ALLOW A SIGNIFICANT TURN TO THE NORTH DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  TRACK GUIDANCE IS IN SLIGHTLY BETTER AGREEMENT BUT
STILL SHOWS SOME SPREAD...BETWEEN FORECAST POSITIONS NEAR OR JUST
SOUTH OF EASTERN CUBA...AS GIVEN BY DEEP- AND MEDIUM LAYER BAM AND
THE BAROTROPIC TO JUST EAST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS AS GIVEN BY THE

THE ELEVATION OF THE RADAR SITE.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CLOUD
TOPS OF -80C ARE OVER PORTIONS OF EASTERN PUERTO RICO AT THIS TIME.

MOTION HAS SLOWED SLIGHTLY AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IN 270/
13 KNOTS.  A MOTION TOWARD THE WEST OR WEST-NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED 
TO RESUME TUESDAY. RADAR-BASED FIXES PLACE THE CENTER OVER THE
CENTRAL PORTION OF PUERTO RICO IN THE VICINITY OF PONCE.
 
THE DEEP-LAYER RIDGE NORTH OF GEORGES IS FORECAST TO PERSIST SUCH
THAT A SIGNIFICANT NORTHERLY TURN SEEMS UNLIKELY. THE 00Z TRACK
MODEL GUIDANCE IS A BIT MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED BUT CONTINUES TO
SHOW SOME SPREAD...WITH THE UKMET THE EASTERN-MOST TRACK...JUST
EAST OF THE SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS... WHILE THE GFDL IS THE WESTERN-MOST
TRACK WITH A 72 HOUR POSITION JUST OFF THE WESTERN COAST OF CUBA.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE
AND BRINGS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE JUST WEST OF THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS BY
72 HOURS.
 
BASED ON THE NEW TRACK FORECAST THE HURRICANE WATCHES FOR HAITI...
THE TURKS AND CACIOS ISLANDS...AND THE SOUTHERN BAHAMAS ARE BEING
UPGRADED TO HURRICANE WARNINGS.

AIR FORCE RECON AND THE SAN JUAN RADAR SHOW A WELL DEFINED CENTER
OVER WATER JUST WEST OF PUERTO RICO.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
275/12.  THE AVIATION MODEL INITIALIZED THE CENTER ABOUT 270 NMI
NORTHEAST OF THE ACTUAL CENTER.  THIS SENDS THE HURRICANE NORTHWARD.
ALL OF THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE MOVES THE HURRICANE ON A WEST-
NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST TRACK WITH LITTLE OR NO DECREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED ON THE INITIAL MOTION.  THE GFDL...NOGAPS
AND LBAR ALL SHOW THE CENTER JUST SOUTH OF FLORIDA IN THREE DAYS AND
SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  AFTER THREE DAYS  THE NOGAPS TURNS
NORTHWARD INTO A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE LOCATED NORTH OF
THE HURRICANE.  THE GFDL/AVN MODEL SHOWS A NARROW EAST/WEST RIDGE
ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA AT THREE DAYS.  

IN ANY CASE...THE FORECAST TRACK IMPLIES A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. IN THREE TO FOUR DAYS.
 
THE PRESSURE WAS 974 MB WHEN RECON WENT INTO THE CENTER AT 05Z.  AT
0631Z...THE PRESSURE FELL TO 970 MB.  PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME
WEAKENING OVER PUERTO RICO BUT NOT MUCH.  AT 09Z THE WIND IS
ESTIMATED AT 95 KNOTS...THE SAME AS BEFORE LANDFALL.  CONSIDERABLE
WEAKENING IS EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS THE HURRICANE
MOVES OVER HISPANIOLA.  BUT STRENGTHENING IS AGAIN POSSIBLE AFTER
THAT DEPENDING ON HOW CLOSE THE TRACK GOES TO CUBA.

HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY AND RADAR FROM SAN JUAN
SHOW A SPECTACULAR EYE PRESENTATION MOVING ALONG THE SOUTH COAST OF
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC ABOUT 280 DEGREES AT 12 KNOTS. BOTH SATELLITE
AND RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT GEORGES HAS STRENGTHENED
AGAIN AND SATELLITE WIND ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB ARE 115 KNOTS.
RECON JUST FOUND THAT THE PRESSURE HAS DROPPED TO 962 MB AND PEAK
WINDS OF 117 KNOTS. INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 105
KNOTS.  THE HURRICANE IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN OF
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND HAITI TODAY BUT HOW MUCH WEAKENING
DEPENDS HOW LONG THE HURRICANE STAYS OVER LAND. THE HURRICANE IS
FORECAST TO REGAIN MUCH OF ITS STRENGTH DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS
IT MOVES OVER WATER.

SINCE THE HURRICANE HAS DECREASED ITS FORWARD MOTION...THERE IS MORE
TIME FOR THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE TO EVOLVE. IF THE
RIDGE WEAKENS...THE HURRICANE COULD BEGIN A NORTHWESTERLY TRACK
SOONER THAN ANTICIPATED. AT THIS TIME MOST...OF THE MODELS ARE
BRINGING THE HURRICANE VERY CLOSE TO THE SOUTHEAST FLORIDA COAST BY
72 HOURS AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. THE LAST PORTION OF THE
FORECAST IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE A SLIGHT STRENGTHENING OF THE
RIDGE COULD FORCE THE HURRICANE OVER FLORIDA AND A SLIGHT WEAKENING
MAY KEEP THE HURRICANE OFFSHORE.  IN ANY CASE...WE SHOULD MONITOR
THE HURRICANE VERY CLOSELY.

THE EYE HAS SURPRISINGLY MAINTAINED ITS IDENTITY IN SPITE OF MOVING
OVER LAND DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS AND IT WAS CLEARLY SEEN ON VIS AND
IR SATELLITE IMAGES UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN IT HAS BEGUN TO FILL.  THE
HURRICANE HAS EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND BANDING FEATURES. GEORGES IS
EXPECTED TO WEAKEN OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
AND HAITI TODAY BUT HOW MUCH WEAKENING DEPENDS HOW LONG THE
HURRICANE STAYS OVER LAND. THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO REGAIN MUCH
OF ITS STRENGTH DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS IT MOVES OVER WATER.
 
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/12 AND SOME DEVIATION OF
THIS GENERAL TRACK IS EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO AS THE
HURRICANE INTERACTS WITH THE VERY HIGH MOUNTAINS OF HISPANIOLA.
THEREAFTER... ONCE OVER WATER AGAIN...THE MOTION OF THE HURRICANE
WILL BE CONTROLLED BY A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM TO THE NORTH...WHICH IN
FACT...MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS MAINTAIN THROUGH 72 HOURS.  TRACK
GUIDANCE IS IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT AND BASICALLY ALL OF THE MODELS
BRING GEORGES WITHIN A BELT BETWEEN HAVANA AND LAKE OKEECHOBEE BY 60
HOURS OR SO.   

THE LAST PORTION OF THE FORECAST IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE A
SLIGHT STRENGTHENING OF THE RIDGE COULD FORCE THE HURRICANE OVER
SOUTH FLORIDA AND INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO AND A SLIGHT WEAKENING
OF THE RIDGE MAY KEEP THE HURRICANE OFFSHORE.  IN ANY CASE...
INTERESTS IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES SHOULD MONITOR THE
HURRICANE VERY CLOSELY.  THE TIME FOR ISSUING A HURRICANE WATCH FOR
A PORTION OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS IS APPROACHING.

HURRICANE GEORGES DISCUSSION NUMBER  31
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT TUE SEP 22 1998
 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE THIS EVENING IS...WHERE IS THE CENTER?
THE MOUNTAINS OF HISPANIOLA...PEAKS TO NEAR 10000 FEET...HAVE
DISRUPTED GEORGES.  THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PICK OUT THE
CENTER...ESPECIALLY ON INFRARED IMAGERY.  AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO FIX THE CENTER UNTIL IT EMERGES BACK OVER THE WATER
WEDNESDAY MORNING.  THE CURRENT POSITION ESTIMATE IS BASED ON
SATELLITE AND SCANTY SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...SOME OF THESE FROM
UNOFFICIAL OBSERVING SITES RELAYED BY HAM RADIO.  WITH LARGE
UNCERTAINTIES IN CURRENT POSITION AND MOTION...IT IS BEST NOT TO
MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  MOTION ESTIMATE IS
290/12 AND THE BEST GUESS IS THAT THE CENTER IS NEARING THE BORDER
OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND HAITI.  IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER
THE CENTER WILL EMERGE ON THE WEST OR THE NORTH COAST OF HAITI.
 
TRACK GUIDANCE IS SIMILAR TO BEFORE.  DROPWINDSONDE DATA FROM THE
NOAA AIRCRAFT SHOWED A FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE NEAR AND JUST EAST OF THE BAHAMAS.  THIS SUPPORTS A
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TRACK DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  LATER IN THE PERIOD...THE TRACK DEPENDS ON HOW THIS
ANTICYCLONE ...AND THE MID/UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE NEAR WESTERN
CUBA...EVOLVE WITH TIME.  THE GENERAL CONSENSUS FROM THE NUMERICAL
MODELS IS THAT THE UPPER CYCLONE WILL MOVE WESTWARD IN ADVANCE OF
GEORGES AND THAT THE RIDGE WILL BE BARELY MAINTAINED FOR THE NEXT
2-3 DAYS.  IF THE UPPER CYCLONE MOVES SIGNIFICANTLY WESTWARD...AND
THE ANTICYCLONE STAYS PUT...A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION
WOULD LIKELY RESULT.  IF THE RIDGE SHIFTS A LITTLE EASTWARD AND THE
UPPER CYCLONE DOES NOT MOVE MUCH...THEN A MORE NORTHWARD TRACK IS
POSSIBLE.  THE LATEST OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN EXTENSION OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE.  THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL AND THE THREE
BAM TRACKS...WHICH ARE ALL VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.
 
ONE SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON OUR PRECISE FORECAST TRACK...ESPECIALLY AT
48 AND 72 HOURS...SINCE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS MAY STILL OCCUR.
 
AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE HAS BEEN FLYING AROUND THE COAST
OF HISPANIOLA AND THEY FOUND THAT A VIGOROUS LOW- TO MID-LEVEL
CIRCULATION STILL EXISTS.  THE INNER CORE...HOWEVER...HAS LIKELY
BEEN SEVERELY DISRUPTED SO THE MAXIMUM WINDS ON THIS ADVISORY ARE
REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY...TO 70 KNOTS.  GEORGES HAS A VERY IMPRESSIVE
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW SIGNATURE AND WOULD CERTAINLY BE A VERY INTENSE
HURRICANE AT THIS TIME...WERE IT NOT LOCATED OVER LAND.  WHEN THE
CENTER MOVES BACK OVER WATER...RE-INTENSIFICATION SEEMS CERTAIN...
PARTICULARLY WHEN GEORGES MOVES OVER THE WARM WATERS OF THE STRAITS
OF FLORIDA.

THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A CENTER TO TRACK ON INFRARED IMAGERY.  THE
INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 285/13...NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN 6
HOURS AGO.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT A
NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS...EXCEPT LBAR AND THE AVIATION
MODEL WHICH TURN GEORGES NORTHWARD AFTER 48 HOURS...APPARENTLY
FINDING A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH THAT THE OTHER MODELS
DO NOT SEE.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF GFDL MODEL...PUTTING THE
CENTER JUST OFF THE LOWER FLORIDA WEST COAST IN 72 HOURS AND IN THE
FLORIDA KEYS IN 48 HOURS.  THE UKMET MODEL IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE
GFDL AND THE NOGAPS IS CONSIDERABLY LEFT...TO NEAR HAVANA IN 72
HOURS.
 
THE WIND SPEED IS ASSUMED TO HAVE DECREASED TO 65 KNOTS WHILE THE
HURRICANE IS OVER LAND.  THE FORECAST INTENSITY ASSUMES THE CENTER
WILL BE OVER WATER AND THAT THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT
INTENSIFICATION...EVEN THOUGH THE FORECAST TRACK IS ON THE NORTH
COAST OF CUBA FOR 24 HOURS.
 
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN THIS FORECAST PACKAGE...SINCE
THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN OVER LAND FOR A WHILE.  THE CENTER IS NOT
WELL DEFINED ON SATELLITE...THERE HAVE BEEN FEW SURFACE OBSERVATIONS
AND THE RECON AIRCRAFT COULD NOT FLY INTO THE HURRICANE OVER LAND.
I AM NOT PLEASED TO PUT UP A HURRICANE WATCH FOR SOUTH FLORIDA WITH
SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY...BUT AM DOING SO AS A STRATEGY OF LEAST REGRET.

HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL THAT GEORGES HAS
MAINTAINED A WELL DEFINED CLOUD PATTERN IN SPITE OF THE HURRICANE
HAVING MOVED OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN OF HISPANIOLA FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS
OR MORE. THERE IS A BROAD CIRCULATION CENTER THAT RESEMBLES AN EYE
WITH PLENTY OF BANDING FEATURES AND DEEP CONVECTION. THE
HURRICANE LACKS OF AN INNER CORE AT THIS TIME.  THE ATMOSPHERE
APPEARS TO BE CONDUCIVE FOR RESTRENGTHENING AND LAND IS THE ONLY
IMPEDIMENT.

BEST ESTIMATES OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/13. HOWEVER...THIS IS
VERY UNCERTAIN SINCE THE HURRICANE JUST MOVED OFF HAITI AND IS
REFORMING. THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO MOVE ON A GENERAL WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK AROUND THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AND THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE MODELS. ON THIS TRACK GEORGES WILL BE
MOVING ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA AND THEREAFTER THROUGH THE
FLORIDA STRAITS OR SOUTH FLORIDA BETWEEN 36 AND 48 HOURS. 

THE NEXT 24 HOURS WILL BE CRITICAL ...THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT
THE HURRICANE WILL MOVE ALONG THE SOUTH COAST OF EASTERN CUBA OR
OVER CUBAN MOUNTAINS. THAT WOULD DELAY THE STRENGTHENING BUT THE
TRACK BEYOND 36 HOURS WOULD NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE

IT CONTINUES TO BE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER USING SATELLITE
IMAGES...BUT OUR BEST GUESS IS THAT IT IS STILL INLAND OVER EASTERN
CUBA.  RECENT OBSERVATIONS FROM GUANTANAMO NAVY BASE ARE CONSISTENT
WITH OUR ESTIMATED POSITION.  THE NOAA PLANE CANNOT LOCATE THE
CENTER WHILE IT IS OVER LAND.  HOWEVER...WE ARE ALERT TO THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE CENTER MAY EMERGE ON THE NORTH COAST AT ANY
TIME...AND IF IT DOES...THE AIRCRAFT SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCATE IT. 
THE CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS A LITTLE SLOWER...295/10.  THE
PRIMARY STEERING MECHANISMS ARE A MID-TO UPPER-LEVEL HIGH TO THE
NORTH OF GEORGES AND A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW NEAR THE NORTHEAST
TIP OF YUCATAN.  THESE FEATURES SHOULD MAINTAIN WEST-NORTHWEST TO
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK FOR THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  OVERALL...THE TRACK
GUIDANCE HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY...AND THE CURRENT NHC
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO ITS PREDECESSOR.  IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO
FOCUS ON THIS PRECISE TRACK BECAUSE HISTORICALLY ERRORS OF 100 TO
150 MILES ARE POSSIBLE IN THE 24 AND 36 HOURS POSITIONS.
 
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD A THREAT TO THE NORTHEASTERN
GULF IS IMPLIED.  INTERESTS THERE SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
GEORGES.
 
ON THE LARGER-SCALE...GEORGES LOOKS IMPRESSIVE WITH HEALTHY
CONVECTIVE BANDING FEATURES AND A PICTURESQUE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC
OUTFLOW PATTERN.  HOWEVER...THE INNER-CORE FEATURES REMAIN
DIFFUSE... LIKELY BECAUSE OF THE INTERACTION WITH LAND.  ASIDE FROM
THE INFLUENCE OF LAND...METEOROLOGICAL AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS FAVOR
STRENGTHENING.  GEORGES IS PREDICTED TO RE-INTENSIFY TO CATEGORY 2
STATUS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...BUT IT COULD DO SO SOONER...AND GEORGES
COULD GET STRONGER THAN WE HAVE SHOWN HERE.  WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT

THE HURRICANE IS STILL CENTERED OVER EASTERN CUBA AND ESTIMATING THE
LOCATION AND INITIAL MOTION IS DIFFICULT.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 300/10 BASED ON LIMITED SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...AND A
POORLY DEFINED CENTER ON INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY AND ON NOAA
AIRCRAFT RADAR AND ON A CUBAN RADAR.
 
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE...
THE HIGH TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE AND THE LOW NEAR THE YUCATAN
CHANNEL CONTINUE TO BE THE CONTROLLING FACTORS AND ARE NOT FORECAST
TO CHANGE RADICALLY DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE GFDL...UKMET
AND NOGAPS MODELS ARE IN CLOSE AGREEMENT SHOWING THE CENTER MOVING
NORTHWESTWARD TO NEAR KEY WEST IN 24 TO 36 HOURS AND CONTINUING TO
THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO IN 72 HOURS.  COMPARED TO THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST CYCLE...THE UKMET CHANGED LITTLE...THE NOGAPS
MOVED TO THE RIGHT AND THE GFDL MOVED SLIGHTLY LEFT.  THE LBAR IS
SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE THREE MODELS JUST MENTIONED.  THE
AVIATION MODEL TURNS GEORGES NORTHWARD ACROSS EASTERN FLORIDA AND
THE ETA AND NGM SHOW THIS ALSO.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
SHIFTED JUST SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BUT NOT
AS FAR AS THE GFDL...NOGAPS AND UKMET WOULD SUGGEST.
 
A NOAA AIRCRAFT WIND REPORT OF 74 KNOTS AT FLIGHT LEVEL TO THE EAST
OF THE CENTER OVER WATER ALLOWS FOR GEORGES TO BE KEPT AS A MINIMAL
HURRICANE WITH 65 KNOT SUSTAINED WINDS.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS
THAT THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN HAS HELD TOGETHER VERY WELL EVEN
THOUGH THE INNER CORE STRUCTURE APPEARS DISORGANIZED.  WITH A
FORECAST OF NOT TOO MUCH VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ALONG THE FORECAST
TRACK COMBINED WITH WARM GULF WATERS...THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF
SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.  THUS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS FOR
INTENSIFICATION AS THE CENTER IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER WATER BY 24
HOURS.  IT SHOULD BE REALIZED THAT OUR SKILL IN FORECASTING
INTENSITY IS QUITE LIMITED COMPARED TO OUR TRACK FORECASTING SKILL.
 
HAVING SAID ALL THAT...IT IS PRUDENT TO ISSUE A HURRICANE WARNING
FOR EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS.  I WOULD LOVE TO WAIT LONGER
BEFORE ISSUING WARNINGS TO MINIMIZE SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY
INVOLVED.  A HURRICANE WARNING FOR A MINIMAL CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE
THAT MIGHT STRENGTHEN IS NOT THE SAME KIND OF SITUATION AS HAVING A

...COR TO 72 HOUR POSITION

NOAA RECONNAISSANCE PLANE HAS BEEN OBSERVING GEORGES DURING THE PAST
FEW HOURS AND THE MINIMUM PRESSURE HAS BEEN OSCILLATING AROUND 989
AND 991 MB. THE PLANE ALSO REPORTED THAT AN EYEWALL IS FORMING.
BASED ON REPORTS FROM THE PLANE AND OBSERVATIONS FROM CUBA...THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS ADJUSTED TO 70 KNOTS. SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE
TO SHOW AN IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW AND BANDING FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH
GEORGES. MOST OF THE MODELS MAINTAIN AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE WITH
LOW SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS AND OTHER CONDITIONS 
ARE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING.  THIS PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN
AS SOON AS THE CENTER MOVES OVER WATER LATER TODAY. THERE IS A HIGH
LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST SO A STRONGER THAN
FORECAST HURRICANE IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 305/10. THERE IS A GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONG THE
MODELS THAT THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT 3
DAYS.  ON THIS TRACK THE CENTER OF GEORGES SHOULD MOVE OFF CUBA
TODAY AND CROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS BETWEEN 24 AND 36 HOURS AND THEN
INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. RESIDENTS ALONG THE GULF COAST
SHOULD BEGIN TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE PROGRESS OF GEORGES.

..COR TO ADV NUMBER

DEEP CONVECTION IS MORE SYMMETRIC AND THE OVERALL PATTERN CONTINUES
TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED.  HOWEVER...THE EYEWALL REMAINS POORLY
DEFINED ON ITS NORTHWEST PORTION.  NOAA RECONNAISSANCE PLANE
MEASURED WINDS OF 85 KNOTS AT FLIGHT LEVEL TO THE EAST OF THE CENTER
AND 985 MB MINIMUM PRESSURE.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS ADJUSTED TO 85
KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  MOST OF THE MODELS MAINTAIN LOW SHEAR OVER THE
HURRICANE SO A CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED. GEORGES IS
FORECAST TO REACH CATEGORY 3 STATUS BY 36 HOURS OR SO.  
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 305/12.  THE STEERING FLOW IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN 
UNCHANGED...SO THE HURRICANE SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE SAME GENERAL
TRACK AS INDICATED BY MOST OF THE MODELS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
BASICALLY AN UPDATE FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK BRINGING THE
CORE OF THE HURRICANE OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 HOURS
AND THEN INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. 

ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE GULF COAST FROM LOUISIANA EASTWARD SHOULD
CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS LARGE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
HURRICANE.

THE EYE IS BECOMING BETTER-DEFINED AS IT APPROACHES THE STRAITS OF
FLORIDA.  LATEST RECON REPORTS SHOWED A CLOSED WALL.  THE UPPER-
LEVEL OUTFLOW REMAINS IMPRESSIVE...AND SUBSTANTIAL STRENGTHENING
COULD OCCUR DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST...WHICH SHOWS GEORGES EVENTUALLY RE-ATTAINING
CATEGORY 3 STATUS.  IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...THE
ONLY FACTORS THAT MIGHT LIMIT INTENSIFICATION ARE A LITTLE MORE
STABLE ATMOSPHERE AND PERHAPS SOME INCREASED SHEAR OVER THE NORTHERN
GULF OF MEXICO.
 
NO BIG CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE TRACK FORECAST SINCE THE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE IS ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE...AND MY SYNOPTIC REASONING IS
THE SAME AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AS WELL.  THE HURRICANE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO BE STEERED ON A COURSE FROM WEST-NORTHWEST TO
NORTHWEST...BETWEEN A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF
GEORGES AND A MID- TO UPPER LEVEL LOW TO THE WEST-SOUTHWEST...OVER
THE SOUTH-CENTRAL GULF.  GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A GRADUAL TRANSITION AT
500 MB DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS...FROM A MOSTLY ZONAL FLOW PATTERN
TO A HIGHER AMPLITUDE ONE OVER THE U.S. AND THIS COULD ALLOW A MORE
NORTHWARD MOTION NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY EAST OF THE LATEST GFDL RUN AT 72 HOURS...AND
ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE IN THE 2- TO 3-DAY TIME FRAME.
AS ALWAYS...THE 3-DAY FORECAST POSITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE
UNCERTAINTY.  ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE GULF COAST FROM LOUISIANA
EASTWARD SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS LARGE AND
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HURRICANE.
 
RECON DATA AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT THE 50-KNOT WIND
RADIUS NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED TO THE NORTHEAST...TO 125 N MI.  THIS
MEANS THAT A LARGE PART OF SOUTH FLORIDA SHOULD EXPERIENCE
POTENTIALLY DAMAGING WINDS FOR THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT FRI SEP 25 1998
 
THE STRUCTURE AND INTENSITY OF GEORGES HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH DURING
THE PAST FEW HOURS.  AN OPEN EYEWALL IS EVIDENT ON RADAR AND TO THE
HURRICANE HUNTERS.  HEAVIEST CONVECTION...WITH THE STRONGEST
WINDS...RAIN AND SURGE ARE ON THE EAST SIDE AND ARE SPREADING OVER
THE FLORIDA KEYS.  SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW A FAINT EYE AT THIS
TIME.  THE HURRICANE HUNTERS MEASURED FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 105
KT...WHILE SPOT WINDS MEASURED IN THE EYEWALL BY A DROPSONDE WERE AS
HIGH AS 109 KT ALOFT AND 85 KT AT THE SURFACE.  THE ESTIMATED
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED SURFACE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 90 KT BASED ON
THESE DATA.
 
THE LARGE-SCALE HIGH OVER TEXAS IS FORECAST BY THE 06Z AVN AND 00Z
NOGAPS TO SHIFT EASTWARD TO THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST DURING THE NEXT
TWO DAYS.  THIS PUTS GEORGES ON THE SW SIDE OF THAT FEATURE...IN A
STEERING CURRENT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A CONTINUED NW MOTION AS
SHOWN BY THE MODEL AND OFFICIAL TRACKS.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS
ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED WITH JUST A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO THE LEFT.
THIS IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL AND NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE OTHER MODEL
TRACKS.
 
THIS POSES AN INCREASING THREAT FROM LOUISIANA EASTWARD TO THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE.  A HURRICANE WATCH IS NOW ISSUED FOR PART OF THAT
AREA.
 
CIRRUS ELEMENTS ARE NO LONGER EXPANDING OUTWARD TO THE NORTHWEST SO
THE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT MIGHT NOT BE QUITE AS CONDUCIVE TO
FURTHER  STRENGTHENING AS EARLIER.  THE SHIPS AND GFDL INTENSITY
SCHEMES SHOW A LITTLE INCREASE IN THE WIND...NOT QUITE AS MUCH AS
SHOWN IN THE CURRENT AND PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECASTS.

WHILE RADAR DATA FROM KEY WEST IS CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE...THE 
EYE IS BECOMING MORE DISTINCT ON SATELLITE PICTURES AND THE CENTRAL
PRESSURE HAS FALLEN A LITTLE OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. RECENTLY...DRY
TORTUGAS HAD 976.3 MB WITH 18 KT WINDS...SO THE CENTRAL PRESSURE IS
ANALYZED AS 975 MB.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 90 KT.  THE
HEADING HAS BEEN 300/12 KT FOR A FEW HOURS...BUT A RETURN TO A NW
MOTION SHOULD RESUME SHORTLY.
 
THE 12Z NOGAPS FORECAST FOR THE LARGE-SCALE EVOLUTION RESEMBLES
PREVIOUS RUNS WITH A DEVELOPING ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN
STATES DRIVING GEORGES TOWARD THE NORTHERN GULF COAST.  LONG-RANGE
FORECASTERS AT THE NWS HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL PREDICTION CENTER HAVE
INDICATED A POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT SLOWING NEAR THE END OF THE
PERIOD.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OUTPUT FROM THE UKMET AND NOGAPS
RUNS AND BAM...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST NOW SHOWS A LITTLE SLOWER
MOVEMENT NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD.

WITH RADAR DATA CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FROM KEY WEST AND GEORGES SOON
TO MOVE OUT OF RANGE OF THE MIAMI RADAR...THE NHC WILL RETURN TO 3-
HOURLY INTERMEDIATE ADVISORIES AND DISCONTINUE HOURLY POSITION
ESTIMATES.

A HURRICANE WARNING COULD BE REQUIRED LATER THIS EVENING OR EARLY IN
THE MORNING FOR A PORTION OF THE NORTHERN GULF COAST.

RADAR AND AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT FIXES DURING
THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS INDICATE THAT THE CENTER OF GEORGES HAS
BEEN WOBBLING WESTWARD.  HOWEVER...THE MOST RECENT RADAR POSITION
ESTIMATE SUGGESTS THAT THE SYSTEM MAY BE RESUMING A MORE WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD HEADING.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/07 KNOTS.

RECON DATA INDICATES THAT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OVERALL CHANGE IN 
GEORGES INTENSITY THE PAST SIX HOURS OR SO.  THE LATEST AIRCRAFT
VORTEX MESSAGE SHOWED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 973 MB AND MAXIMUM
FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 94 KNOTS.  THE DRY TORTUGAS C-MAN BUOY
REPORTED SOUTHERLY WINDS OF 50 KNOTS AND A PRESSURE OF 989.9 MB
AT 01Z.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 90 KNOTS.  SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE DEEPEST CONVECTION IS OCCURRING ON THE
EASTERN SIDE OF THE SYSTEM.  THE OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED OVER THE
NORTHWEST QUADRANT BUT REMAINS IMPRESSIVE ELSEWHERE.  ANALYSES 
FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SHOW SOME 20-30 KT VERTICAL WIND
SHEAR OVER THE NORTHEAST/CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.  ALTHOUGH THE 
RIDGE ASSOCIATED WITH GEORGES SHOULD LESSEN THE SHEAR AS IT BUILDS
NORTHWARD IT STILL MAY HAMPER FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THE FORECAST
CONTINUES THE TREND OF GRADUAL INTENSIFICATION BRINGING GEORGES TO
CATEGORY THREE STATUS BY 36 HOURS.      

THE MODEL TRACK GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO SHOW CONSIDERABLE SCATTER WITH
LBAR...UKMET AND NOGAPS SHOWING A 72 HOUR POSITION SOUTH OF THE
LOUISIANA COAST WHILE THE GFDL...AVN AND A98E ARE INLAND BETWEEN
ALABAMA AND THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE BY 48 HOURS. THE GFDL AND AVN
INDICATE THAT GEORGES ROTATES AROUND THE 500 MB ANTICYCLONE TO 
THE EAST.  THE EVOLVING SYNOPTIC PATTERN INDICATES THAT THE FORWARD
MOTION MAY SLOW. 

THE NOAA G-IV JET IS PERFORMING A SYNOPTIC FLOW MISSION OVER THE
GULF OF MEXICO THIS EVENING WITH THE DATA TO BE USED TO INITIALIZE
THE 00Z GLOBAL MODELS.

THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE WIND OR PRESSURE PATTERN
ASSOCIATED WITH GEORGES. MINIMUM PRESSURE REMAINS NEAR 974 MB AND
PEAK WINDS ARE ABOUT 90 KNOTS. THE INNER CORE HAS NOT REFORMED
COMPLETELY YET SINCE IT WAS DISRUPTED BY LAND.  HOWEVER...IT USUALLY
TAKES TIME FOR THE BOUNDARY LAYER TO RECOVER FROM THE INTERACTION
WITH LAND.  ONE SHOULD MENTION THAT THE INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL
...SHIPS...DOES NOT STRENGTHEN THE HURRICANE AND THE GFDL IS NOT
SHOWING THE EXPLOSIVE INTENSIFICATION WHICH IT NORMALLY FORECASTS. 
THIS SUGGESTS THERE MAY BE SOME FACTORS INHIBITING THE
STRENGTHENING.  BECAUSE MOST OF THE MODELS MAINTAIN LOW SHEAR OVER
THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE WATER IS WARM...A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING
IS INDICATED.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 295/08.  THERE IS A STRONG 500 MB RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF THE HURRICANE WHICH IS FORECAST TO MOVE EASTWARD. THIS
WOULD ALLOW THE HURRICANE TO MOVE ON A NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.
HOWEVER...MODELS...MAINLY THE UKMET AND NOGAPS ARE FORECASTING A
TRACK MORE TO THE WEST AND BOTH KEEP THE HURRICANE MOVING ALONG THE
LOUISIANA AND EASTERN TEXAS COASTS. THE GFDL SLOWS DOWN THE
HURRICANE CONSIDERABLY BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE BUT A SMALL
WESTWARD SHIFT MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY IF THE MODELS CONTINUE TO
SHOW A WESTWARD TREND AND A RIDGE BUILDING TO THE NORTH.

DATA FROM A NOAA BUOY AND AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE SHOW A RATHER
ASYMMETRIC WIND FIELD AT THIS TIME WITH HURRICANE FORCE WINDS
CONFINED TO THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE AND A MUCH LONGER EXTENT OF
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS IN THAT DIRECTION.  LIGHT WESTERLY SHEAR
IS ANALYZED AND THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE AGAIN ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 90
KT.
 
WHILE THE TRACK HAS EDGED TOWARD THE LEFT OVER THE PAST FEW
FORECASTS...THE FINAL CENTER FIX FROM THE HURRICANE HUNTERS FOR THIS
ADVISORY SUGGESTS THAT THE HEADING HAS EASED BACK TO 300 DEGREES AT
10 KT.  THE LARGE SCALE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW AN ANTICYCLONE
SHIFTING TO THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES AND A TROUGH SWINGING EASTWARD
ACROSS THE NORTH CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN STATES.  THIS TROUGH
PASSES BY TO THE NORTH OF GEORGES AND THE TRAILING DEVELOPING RIDGE
COULD SLOW OR BLOCK THE NORTHWARD PROGRESS NEAR THE END OF THE
PERIOD AS GEORGES APPROACHES LAND.  THE TRACK MODELS GENERALLY SHOW
THIS SLOWING...BUT THEIR SOLUTIONS BEGIN TO DIVERGE AFTER 48 HOURS. 
THE PRIMARY THREAT REMAINS FOR THE AREA FROM THE WESTERN FLORIDA
PANHANDLE TO LOUISIANA AND A HURRICANE WARNING IS NOW ISSUED FROM
MORGAN CITY TO PANAMA CITY.
 
GIVEN THE FORECAST TRACK AND INTENSITY...GEORGES IS LIKELY TO POSE A
SIGNIFICANT FLOOD DANGER DUE TO BOTH STORM SURGE AND RAINFALL.

FOR THE VULNERABLE AREAS IN THE WARNED ZONE...PARTICULARLY AROUND
NEW ORLEANS AND ELSEWHERE IN SOUTHEASTERN LOUISIANA...GEORGES IS
POSING AN INCREASING AND UNUSUALLY SEVERE FLOOD THREAT FROM A
COMBINATION OF STORM SURGE AND RAINFALL.

THE FORECAST GUIDANCE HAS CHANGED LITTLE.  MODEL OUTPUT CONTINUES TO
SHOW GEORGES SLOWING DOWN AS IT NEARS THE COAST IN THE WARNING AREA.
THE GFDL RUN FROM 12Z IS NOW AVAILABLE AND IT IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO
OUR PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST.  OTHER GUIDANCE HAS CONVERGED
SOMEWHAT ALONG THAT TRACK AS WELL..SO NO IMPORTANT CHANGES HAVE BEEN
MADE TO THE NHC TRACK.  A SIGNIFICANT SLOW DOWN IS AGAIN EXPECTED AS
GEORGES TEMPORARILY BECOMES TRAPPED IN THE WEAK STEERING FLOW REGIME
BETWEEN THE HIGH TO BE CENTERED TO THE SE OVER FLORIDA...AND ANOTHER
HIGH DEVELOPING TO THE NW OF GEORGES IN THE WAKE OF THE SHORT-WAVE
TROUGH MOVING OFFSHORE FROM THE EAST COAST.
 
THE EYE HAS GRADUALLY BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED ON SATELLITE PICTURES
WITH DVORAK T-NUMBERS NOW HAVING REACHED 5.5...OR 102 KT.  THE
HURRICANE HUNTERS RECENTLY FOUND A 968 MB PRESSURE AND 92 KT AT
FLIGHT LEVEL...BUT AN EYEWALL DROPSONDE SHOWED 95 KT AT THE SURFACE. 
THE MOST RECENT HRD ANALYSIS SHOWS AROUND 70 KT.  THESE DATA SHOW
THE UNCERTAINTY INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THE MAXIMUM WIND SPEED.  THE

ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.

THE LATEST RECON FIX GIVES A MOTION OF 310/09 FOR THE PAST 12
HOURS...COMPARED TO 305/09 ON THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. THE PAST 6 HOUR
MOTION IS 315/09.
 
THE GUIDANCE HAS CHANGED LITTLE...AGAIN.   ALL OF THE MODELS SHOW A
SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TO THE
EAST...NORTH...AND WEST OF THE HURRICANE.  THE 12Z UKMET AND NOGAPS
MODELS SHOW A 72 HOUR POSITION JUST OFFSHORE OF THE CENTRAL
LOUISIANA COAST.  THE LBAR 72 HOUR POSITION IS IN CENTRAL LOUISIANA
AND THE GFDL 72 HOUR POSITION IS IN CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI.  THE GFDL
MODEL...BASED ON THE 18Z AVIATION RUN IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN ITS
PREVIOUS RUN.  THE AVIATION MODEL IS IN SOUTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND IS
SOMEWHAT LEFT OF ITS PREVIOUS RUN.
 
IN SUMMARY...THE GUIDANCE SHOWS THE CORE OF THE HURRICANE REACHING
NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IN ABOUT 24 HOURS AND
SLOWING DOWN.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE GFDL MODEL...EXCEPT
IS A LITTLE SLOWER AFTER 48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALSO
VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST...SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE
RIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT INITIAL MOTION.
 
THE LATEST RECON FIX HAD A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 968 MB...NO CHANGE
FROM EARLIER.  THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED AN ELLIPTICAL SHAPED EYE AT
2325Z AND THEN NO EYE AT 0113Z.  HOWEVER SATELLITE SHOWS AN EYE
FEATURE FORMING AND KEVX EGLIN RADAR SHOWS EVIDENCE OF AN EYE
AT ABOUT 200 MILES RANGE.  THE LATEST HRD SURFACE ANALYSIS HAS THE
WIND SPEED UP 5 KNOTS TO 75 KNOTS.  THE MAXIMUM AIRCRAFT WIND SPEED
WAS 86 KNOTS IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT WHICH IS A LITTLE LESS THAT
THE PREVIOUS RECON MISSION.  THE OFFICIAL WIND SPEED AND FORECAST IS
KEPT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...EXCEPT FOR BRINGING THE
WINDS DOWN SOME MORE AT 48 AND 72 HOURS AS THE CENTER IS FORECAST A
LITTLE FURTHER INLAND.
 
THE FORECAST SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE HURRICANE PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR EXTREMELY LARGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS COMBINED WITH A LONG PERIOD OF
ONSHORE WINDS AND STORM SURGE FLOODING.  THE GFDL MODEL PROJECTS
SOME 32 INCHES OF RAIN ALONG THE PATH OF THE HURRICANE.

SHEAR IS LOW BUT...AT THIS STAGE...THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ENOUGH
FOR THE HURRICANE TO INTENSIFY RAPIDLY.  IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN
MOST OF THE HURRICANE INTENSITY CHANGE WORKSHOPS...THAT...FOR RAPID
INTENSIFICATION...THERE SHOULD BE AN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLE
AND/OR A TROUGH INTERACTION.  THESE TWO PROCESSES ARE VERY DIFFICULT
TO EVALUATE...BUT WITH THE LIMITED AVAILABLE INFORMATION...NONE OF
THE ABOVE PROCESSES ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR BECAUSE THE INGREDIENTS ARE
NOT PRESENT.  THERE IS NOT A PERSISTENT AND WELL DEFINED INNER
CORE...NO DOUBLE EYE STRUCTURE EITHER AND THERE IS NO UPPER-TROUGH
APPROACHING THE HURRICANE.  ONLY A SMALL INCREASE IN INTENSITY IS
THEN FORECAST BEFORE LANDFALL.  THIS IS AN ARRESTED FORECAST BECAUSE
THE ABOVE PROCESSES ARE STILL IN THEORY AND HAVE NOT BEEN TRANSLATED
INTO OPERATIONAL TOOLS YET.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 310/09.  THE STEERING PATTERN IS EVOLVING AS
FORECAST.  THEREFORE...NO CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK IS NECESSARY.   MODELS CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT THE STEERING
CURRENTS WILL COLLAPSE AS THE HURRICANE MAKES LANDFALL.  THIS MEANS
THAT THE HURRICANE WOULD SLOW DOWN CONSIDERABLY AND COULD PRODUCE
EXTREMELY LARGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS COMBINED WITH A LONG PERIOD OF
ONSHORE WINDS AND STORM SURGE FLOODING.  GEORGES IS A VERY SERIOUS
THREAT AND IT COULD BE EVEN WORSE IF THE HURRICANE STRENGTHENS MORE
THAN
FORECAST.

A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 963 MB FROM A GPS DROPSONDE WITH
MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 86 KNOTS.  BUOY 42040 REPORTED A 
45 KT 8-MINUTE SUSTAINED WIND...APPROXIMATELY 55 KT 1-MINUTE WIND
SPEED...AND 33 FOOT SEAS AT 12Z WHILE THE C-MAN BUOY NEAR THE MOUTH
OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WAS 39 KT. THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE
HELD AT 95 KNOTS.  THIS KEEPS GEORGES ON THE HIGH END OF CATEGORY
TWO STATUS.  THE FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR GEORGES TO STRENGTHEN 
TO A CATEGORY THREE BEFORE LANDFALL. 

BASED ON THE WIND DATA ABOVE...RECON WIND PLOTS AND HURRICANE
RESEARCH DIVISION...HRD...ANALYSES THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN
ADJUSTED.  THE PRIMARY CHANGE IS THE ADDITION OF HURRICANE-FORCE
WINDS IN THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  

FIXES FROM RECON AND NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR SUGGEST
A SLIGHT SLOWING IN THE FORWARD SPEED OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS.  THE 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 315/07.  THE SYNOPTIC REASONING REGARDING
THE TRACK REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM THE LAST SEVERAL ADVISORIES. A
GRADUAL SLOWDOWN IS FORECAST AS STEERING CURRENTS WEAKEN.  THUS...
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY. THIS MEANS THAT THE HURRICANE COULD PRODUCE EXTREMELY
LARGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS COMBINED WITH A LONG PERIOD OF ONSHORE WINDS
AND STORM SURGE FLOODING.  GEORGES IS A VERY SERIOUS THREAT AND IT
COULD BE EVEN WORSE IF THERE IS FURTHER STRENGTHENING.

...CORRECTION FOR INITIAL POSITION 27/2100Z...

THE RADAR PRESENTATION OF THE CENTER OF GEORGES FROM THE NATIONAL
WEATHER SERVICE RADAR IN NEW ORLEANS HAS BEEN RATHER POOR THE LAST
6 HOURS OR SO WITH A 50 PERCENT OPEN EYE WALL.  THE AIR FORCE
RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN REPORTING A SIMILAR EYE
STATE WITH THE OPENING ROTATING FROM THE SOUTH TO NORTHWEST  TO
SOUTHWEST.  THE OPENING HAS BEEN OCCURRING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE 
THE STRONGEST CONVECTION.  THE LATEST RECON...1935Z...NOW REPORTS 
A CLOSED EYE WALL AND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 961 MB. MAXIMUM FLIGHT-
LEVEL WINDS HAVE BEEN HOVERING AROUND 85 KT ALTHOUGH A GPS DROPSONDE
RECORDED A 100 KT WIND AT 952 MB.  WITH NO DATA TO THE CONTRARY THE
INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 95 KT...AND WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGH 24
HOURS. HOWEVER...SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE STILL POSSIBLE
AND GEORGES COULD REACH CATEGORY THREE STATUS PRIOR TO LANDFALL.

SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN NEW ORLEANS
SHOW THAT TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND GUSTS...34 KT...AT 18Z.  DAUPHIN
ISLAND C-MAN BUOY RECENTLY REPORTED A 58 MPH SUSTAINED WIND OVER 
2 MINUTES WITH A PEAK GUST TO HURRICANE FORCE.  BUOY 42040 IS
REPORTING 1-MINUTE SUSTAINED WINDS TO NEAR HURRICANE FORCE A 969.8
MB PRESSURE AND SEAS TO 36 FEET.  THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED
USING THE MOST CURRENT SURFACE REPORTS AND RECONNAISSANCE DATA.

WHILE THE RECONNAISSANCE AND HOURLY RADAR POSITION ESTIMATES HAVE
BEEN SHOWING SOME WOBBLE IN THE CENTER LOCATION THE 6-HOURLY MOTION
IS NORTHWESTWARD. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 320/07 KT.  A
GRADUAL DECELERATION IS STILL FORECAST OVER THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS  
AS ENVIRONMENTAL STEERING COLLAPSES. THE 18Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE
IS MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED ON A NORTHWEST HEADING FOR THE FIRST 24 
TO 36 HOURS WITH BEND TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST THEREAFTER.  NOGAPS
IS THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION WHICH MOVES GEORGES WESTWARD THROUGH THE
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SLIGHTLY RIGHT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY MAINLY DUE TO THE INITIAL POSITION.

THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SLOW-MOVING HURRICANE COULD BE COPIOUS 
RAINFALL IN PORTIONS OF THE WARNING AREA AS WELL AS A PROLONGED 
LONG PERIOD OF ONSHORE WINDS AND STORM SURGE FLOODING.  

THE HURRICANE WATCH EAST OF PANAMA CITY TO ST. MARKS FLORIDA WILL
BE LOWERED.

OUT TO 335/06 AND THE 6 HOUR MOTION IS ONLY 4 KNOTS.  THE TRACK
MODEL GUIDANCE...AGAIN...HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH...AND SHOWS THE

ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BECAUSE OF THE
INITIAL MOTION AND IS THEN SLOWED DOWN EVEN MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  THE GFDL MODEL SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE WEST THROUGH 48
HOURS AND THEN A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH...BUT VERY SLOW AVERAGING
ABOUT 3 KNOTS.  SO AT 24 HOURS...THE OFFICIAL TRACK SHOWS A PARTIAL
LEFT TURN OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE GFDL MODEL.
 
IN ANY CASE...THE SLOW MOTION ALLOWS FOR LOTS OF RAIN...THE GFDL
MODEL SHOWS A MAX OF 62 INCHES OVER EASTERN LOUISIANA.  THIS IS
PROBABLY EXCESSIVE...BUT IS INDICATIVE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS
FRESH WATER FLOODING.  COMBINE THIS WITH STRONG ONSHORE WINDS PILING
UP THE GULF WATERS ALONG THE COAST.  WE ARE TALKING SERIOUS FLOOD
POTENTIAL.
 
THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED 5 KNOTS TO 90 KNOTS BASED ON HRD WIND

THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INTENSITY OR TRACK
FORECASTS.  GEORGES IS MOVING NORTH-NORTHWEST ABOUT 5 KNOTS AND MOST
OF THE MODELS SUGGEST VERY LITTLE MOTION DURING THE NEXT 24 OR 36
HOURS.  IN FACT...THE GFDL KEEPS THE HURRICANE BASICALLY IN THE SAME
AREA THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE AND KEEPS GEORGES DRIFTING ONE A GENERAL NORTH-
NORTHWEST TRACK DURING THE 3 DAYS.  THE SLOW MOTION ALLOWS FOR LOTS
OF RAIN AND THIS IS INDICATIVE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS
FRESH WATER FLOODING.  COMBINE THIS WITH STRONG ONSHORE WINDS PILING
UP THE GULF WATERS ALONG THE COAST.  WE ARE TALKING SERIOUS FLOOD
POTENTIAL.
 
BOTH NOOA AND AIR FORCE PLANE HAVE BEEN IN THE EYE OF GEORGES AND
THE MINIMUM PRESSURES WERE 960 AND 964 MB RESPECTIVELY. A DROP IN
THE EYEWALL RECORDED 101 KNOTS AT THE 920 MB LEVEL AND THIS
COINCIDES WITH DOPPLER WINDS FROM NEW ORLEANS RADAR.  SATELLITE 
SHOWS A WELL DEFINED RING OF DEEP CONVECTION SURROUNDING THE EYE.
THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE HURRICANE REMAINS WITH MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS
OF 90 KNOTS. A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST AFTER THE CENTER MOVES

GEORGES HAS MOVED VERY LITTLE OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS BUT ENOUGH OF
THE CIRCULATION AND CORE HAS MOVED OVER LAND SO THAT WEAKENING IS
OCCURRING.  FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY AS THE SYSTEM MOVES SLOWLY
OVER LAND.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT THE
GFDL MODEL KEEPS GEORGES MEANDERING NOT FAR FROM WHERE IT IS
CURRENTLY LOCATED FOR THE NEXT TWO TO THREE DAYS...BUT OTHER MODELS
SUCH AS THE BAROTROPIC...THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL AND THE DEEP BAM
MOVE GEORGES NEAR TO OR EAST OF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST IN 72
HOURS.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE
AND...PESSIMISTICALLY...KEEPS GEORGES OVER SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI
DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE PERIOD...WITH A LITTLE NORTHEASTWARD
MOTION LATER.  OF COURSE IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THE SYSTEM
MAY MAKE CONTACT WITH STRONGER WESTERLIES AND BE CARRIED
SIGNIFICANTLY FARTHER NORTHEAST OR EAST THAN SHOWN IN THIS FORECAST.

WITH THE SLOW MOVEMENT...HUGE AMOUNTS OF RAIN ARE EXPECTED. 
ADDITIONAL TOTALS OF 20 TO 30 INCHES ARE INDICATED IN THIS ADVISORY.

WARNINGS WILL BE KEPT UP ON THE COAST AS WINDS ARE STILL FAIRLY
STRONG. HOWEVER THE STORM SURGE SHOULD BE DECREASING.

THE TROPICAL CYCLONE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE
A 60-KNOT TROPICAL STORM.  SINCE THE SYSTEM SHOULD REMAIN OVER
LAND...A CONTINUED GRADUAL SPIN-DOWN IS FORECAST.
 
RADAR SHOWS A VERY SLOW MOVEMENT...SLIGHTLY EAST OF NORTH..3 KNOTS
OR SO.  THE LATEST AVN MODEL RUN SUGGESTS ENOUGH OF A BREAK IN THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO ALLOW GEORGES TO MOVE NORTHWARD...THEN
NORTHEASTWARD AND EAST-NORTHEASTWARD IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  HOWEVER
OTHER GUIDANCE SUCH AS THE NOGAPS SHOWS LITTLE MOTION.  THE CURRENT
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NOT QUITE AS PESSIMISTIC AS THE PREVIOUS
ONE...BUT STILL HAS GEORGES LINGERING ABOUT OVER ALABAMA IN 2 TO 3
DAYS.  GUIDANCE SUCH AS LBAR AND THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL MODEL
MOVE GEORGES MUCH FARTHER TO EAST-NORTHEAST.
 
THE PRIMARY THREAT FROM GEORGES IS SHIFTING TO THAT OF HEAVY
PRECIPITATION AND SEVERE LOCAL STORMS.  OBVIOUSLY...THE MAGNITUDE OF
FRESHWATER FLOODING DEPENDS ON HOW SLOWLY THE SYSTEM MOVES DURING
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.
 
EVEN THOUGH GEORGES HAS BEEN INLAND SINCE THIS MORNING...BECAUSE OF
ITS SIZE AND SLOW MOVEMENT...TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS ARE PROBABLY
STILL OCCURRING OVER A PORTION OF THE COASTLINE.  THEREFORE THE
HURRICANE WARNING IS BEING CHANGED TO A TROPICAL STORM WARNING

THE MOBILE RADAR SHOWS THAT THE CENTER OF GEORGES HAS MOVED IN A
SMALL CYCLONIC LOOP OVER THE PAST 8 TO 10 HOURS.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE
TOO SURPRISING AS SOME OF THE MODELS HAVE BEEN PREDICTING VERY
LITTLE MOTION.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 160/04.
 
MODEL GUIDANCE...
THE LBAR AND AVIATION MODEL AS WELL AS A STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL MODEL
MOVE GEORGES MOSTLY EASTWARD ACROSS GEORGIA AND OFF THE EAST COAST
IN 72 HOURS. THE NOGAPS TRACK IS SLOW NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD FOR 24
HOURS AND THEN LOSES THE CIRCULATION.  THE UKMET SHOWS VERY LITTLE
MOTION FOR 72 HOURS AND THE GFDL SHOWS SLOW SOUTHEAST TO EASTWARD
MOTION TO OVER THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE IN 72 HOURS.
 
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS FOR A SLOW MOSTLY EASTWARD DRIFT FOR
72 HOURS AS A KIND OF CONSENSUS OF THE ABOVE GUIDANCE.
 
A REPORT OF 39 KNOT SUSTAINED WIND SPEED FROM HURBURT FIELD IN THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE ALONG WITH 35 TO 50 KNOT WINDS FROM THE MOBILE
RADAR SOUTH OF THE CENTER AT 1000 FT OR SO ELEVATION IS THE BASIS
FOR KEEPING GEORGES AS A TROPICAL STORM.  AND IT MAY REMAIN SO FOR A

GEORGES BROKE OUT OF ITS SMALL CYCLONIC LOOP AND IS NOW HEADING
EAST-NORTHEAST AT ABOUT 7 KT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A
CONTINUED ENE TO E MOTION AND IS SIMILAR TO A CLUSTER OF MODEL
FORECAST TRACKS.  

THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL FLOODING PERSISTS AS SOME OF THE
GUIDANCE INDICATES A RE-SLOWING...IMPLYING THAT WESTERLIES MIGHT NOT
PICK UP GEORGES...OR ITS REMNANTS...FOR A FEW DAYS.  FOR EXAMPLE...
THE GFDL AND NOGAPS SHOW SMALL CLOCKWISE LOOPS WHILE THE UKMET HAS A

GEORGES HAS CONTINUED TO SLOWLY WEAKEN AND SUSTAINED WINDS APPEAR TO
HAVE FINALLY FALLEN BELOW TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  THE CYCLONE IS
FORECAST TO REMAIN INLAND FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO...SO FURTHER
WEAKENING IS LIKELY.

GEORGES HAS BEEN MOVING SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD...AROUND 5 KNOTS...AND
A CONTINUED SLOW MOTION IS PREDICTED.  HOWEVER SOME OF THE TRACK
MODELS INDICATE THAT THE LOW WILL EMERGE INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. 
IF THIS HAPPENS...THERE IS A CHANCE FOR REGENERATION.  ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY IS THAT GEORGES REMNANTS COULD MERGE WITH THE COLD FRONT
THAT IS LIKELY TO MOVE OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST THURSDAY EVENING.

THE THREAT OF VERY HEAVY RAINS AND TORNADOES ASSOCIATED WITH GEORGES
CONTINUES.  RADAR AND SATELLITE SHOWS STRONG BANDS OF CONVECTION
PERSISTING OVER PORTIONS OF WESTERN FLORIDA...SOUTHERN ALABAMA AND
GEORGIA.

THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER ON

THERE ARE MANY SATELLITE EXPERTS OUT THERE...AND WE KNOW THAT THEY
ARE SAYING THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW DEPRESSION
IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IS NOT THE TYPICAL ONE...OF COURSE IT IS NOT.
HOWEVER...A COUPLE OF AN AIR FORCE PLANES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING
THE AREA TODAY AND FOUND A VERY TIGHT AND WELL DEFINED CIRCULATION
WITH 30 TO 35 KNOT WINDS CLOSE TO THE CENTER.  THERE ARE ALSO
CLUSTERS OF DEEP CONVECTION MAINLY TO THE SOUTH OF THE CENTER. 
BASED ON THIS INFORMATION THE SYSTEM IS BEING UPGRADED TO TROPICAL
DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME.  THE ENVIRONMENT IS HOSTILE FOR DEVELOPMENT
AT THIS TIME TO DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE SYSTEM TO A LARGE UPPER-
LOW OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.  MODELS ARE FORECASTING
THAT THE UPPER-LOW WILL WEAKEN AND THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPRESSION
TO STRENGTHEN AS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION IS 270/04. A GENERAL TRACK TOWARD THE WEST AND THEN
NORTHWEST SHOULD CONTINUE AS THE DEPRESSION MOVES TO THE NORTH OF
THE UPPER LOW.  THEREAFTER...MOST OF THE MODELS TURN THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO THE NORTH AND NORTH-NORTHEAST AHEAD OF A NEW TROUGH. 

TRACK AND INTENSITY FORECASTS REQUIRES A TROPICAL STORM WATCH AT
THIS TIME FROM SARGENT TEXAS TO GRAND ISLE LOUISIANA. THIS LARGE

11 PM EDT THU SEP 17 1998
 
CENTER FIXES FROM THE HURRICANE HUNTERS SHOWED A SOUTHWEST MOVEMENT
OF ABOUT 5 KT THIS EVENING.  THIS MOTION AND THE TRACK OVER THE PAST
24-36 HOURS SUGGEST THAT THE TD IS SLOWLY ORBITING AROUND THE
BROADER CYCLONIC CIRCULATION THAT IS CENTERED TO THE SOUTHEAST AND
WHICH COVERS MUCH OF THE GULF OF MEXICO.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
CLEARLY DEPICTS THE MID TO UPPER-LEVEL PART OF THAT CIRCULATION
CENTERED NEAR 24N90W.
 
THE PRIMARY QUESTION FOR THE TRACK FORECAST IS...AT WHAT POINT AND
TIME WILL THE TD BE RELEASED FROM THE GRIP OF THE UPPER LOW?  THE
18Z AVN WEAKENS THE UPPER LOW AND MOVES IT TO SE LA BY ABOUT 36
HOURS.  THE 12Z NOGAPS OPENS THE LOW NEAR THE TX/LA COAST IN ABOUT
48 HOURS.  EITHER OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS WOULD IMPLY THAT A NORTHWARD
COMPONENT COULD BE UNDERWAY IN ANOTHER DAY OR SO.  HENCE...ALTHOUGH
THE TRACK OF THE TD COULD FOLLOW A CUSP OR SMALL CYCLONIC LOOP IN
THE INTERIM...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DOESNT GET SO FANCY.  IT SHOWS
LITTLE MOVEMENT FOR 12 TO 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A GENERAL NORTHWARD
OR NORTHEASTWARD HEADING.

CONVECTION HAS INCREASED A LITTLE AND A 37 KT WIND WAS REPORTED AT
1500 FEET FROM THE RECON PLANE.  HENCE...THE SYSTEM IS APPROACHING
TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH AND SOME INTENSIFICATION IS AGAIN FORECAST.

FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS TREND AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACK BUT A LITTLE MORE TO THE WEST.

 
CONVECTION HAS REMAINED ABOUT CONSTANT AND MAXIMUM WINDS REPORTED

WARMER THAN THE ENVIRONMENT.  MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS SO FAR ARE
38 KNOTS WHICH INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM IS STILL A TROPICAL
DEPRESSION.  THE ENVIRONMENT IS SOMEWHAT HOSTILE FOR STRENGTHENING

THE DEPRESSION IS DRIFTING NORTHWARD BUT WITH THE APPROACHING MID TO

IS FORECAST WITH SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED. THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE.

...CORRECTION...POSSIBLE NEW CENTER POSITION 26.5N 91.8W
 
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WAS ABLE TO LOCATE THE CENTER OF DEPRESSION
EIGHT AS A VERY WEAK VORTEX WITH LIGHT WINDS NEAR THE CENTER.
HIGHEST WINDS WERE NEARLY 40 KNOTS AT FLIGHT LEVEL NEAR THE
CONVECTION LOCATED SOME 120 NM NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  DEEP
CONVECTION CONTINUES TO BURST OVER A SMALL AREA NEARLY TWO TO THREE
DEGREES NORTHEAST OF THIS CENTER.  GIVEN THE CONTINUED SHEARED
ENVIRONMENT ...THE CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 30 KNOTS AND THE
FORECAST INTENSITY REDUCED TO 35 KNOTS FOR ALL PERIODS EXCEPT FOR
THE LAST WHERE 20 KNOTS IS FORECAST OVER LAND.  IF THIS SHEARING
CONTINUES...IT APPEARS UNLIKELY THAT THE SYSTEM WILL REGAIN DEEP
CONVECTION AND ATTAIN TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY AT ALL.
 
THE DEPRESSION REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY...EXCEPTING THE SMALL
EAST SOUTHEASTWARD DRIFT.  IT IS FORECAST TO REMAIN EFFECTIVELY
STATIONARY THROUGH THE 12-HOUR FORECAST PERIOD BEFORE MOVING NORTH
AND NORTHEAST.  THIS MOTION IS FORECAST AS AN UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH...LOCATED PRESENTLY OVER WEST TEXAS...MOVES EASTWARD.  IF THE
SYSTEM FAILS TO REGAIN DEEP CONVECTION...THE LOW-LEVEL VORTEX WILL
BE STEERED MORE BY THE LOWER LEVEL FLOW.

AFTER THE ABOVE DISCUSSION WAS WRITTEN THE RECONN AIRCRAFT FOUND
ANOTHER CENTER NEAR 26.5N 91.8W.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE CENTER
MOVED 60NM IN 2 HOURS BUT SINCE THIS CENTER IS SOMEWHAT CLOSER TO
THE DEEP CONVECTION...A NEW CENTER MAYBE FORMING.  IN ANY CASE...IF
TRUE...THE FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS ARE STILL 15 TO 20 KNOTS NEAR THIS NEW
CENTER AND THE MORE NORTHERLY POSITION IS STILL COVERED BY THE WATCH
AREA.  FIRST VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOULD CLARIFY THIS

THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER STRENGTHENING SINCE THIS MORNING.  IN
FACT...IT NOW APPEARS THAT WINDS OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE ARE
CONFINED TO THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE IN AREAS OF STRONGER CONVECTION. 
THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS AGAIN LOCATED WEST-SOUTHWEST OF THE DENSE
OVERCAST.  LATEST ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS
SHOW WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR OF 20 TO 25 KNOTS AHEAD OF
THE SYSTEM...NEAR THE CENTRAL GULF COAST.  THIS ENVIRONMENT SHOULD
NOT ALLOW ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STRENGTH THROUGH TONIGHT...
AFTER WHICH TIME HERMINE IS FORECAST TO BE INLAND.

RECON AND SATELLITE FIXES GIVE A NORTHWARD MOTION OF 6 TO 8 KNOTS. 
USING THIS MOTION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CARRIES THE CENTER INLAND
WITHIN 12 HOURS WITH A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST THEREAFTER.  A MORE
NORTHEASTWARD TRACK...BEFORE LANDFALL...IS LOOKING LESS LIKELY SINCE
NEARLY ALL OF THE NUMERICAL GUIDANCE IS SPREAD BETWEEN A 340 TO 030

DEEP CONVECTION IS SOMEWHAT RAGGED LOOKING...BUT IT CONTINUES TO BE
RATHER PERSISTENT NEAR THE SUSPECTED CENTER.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS
ESTIMATED AT 35 KNOTS...WHICH UPGRADES TD9 TO TROPICAL STORM IVAN. 
THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND
SAB. A MODEST AMOUNT OF STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST IN THE SHORT
TERM...BUT SHEARING CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO INHIBIT SIGNIFICANT
DEVELOPMENT.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/12.  CURRENT FORECAST TRACK IS
ADJUSTED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND IS IN
BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE SHALLOW BAM.  IF THE SYSTEM DEVELOPS MORE
THAN EXPECTED...IS WOULD LIKELY TURN MORE TOWARD THE NORTH IN
RESPONSE TO DEEPER LAYER STEERING.

A SHEARING PATTERN CONTINUES TO INHIBIT THE STRENGTHENING OF IVAN. 
DEEP CONVECTION CONTINUES NEAR THE CENTER...ALTHOUGH IT IS RAGGED IN
APPEARANCE AND IS REFLECTED IN THE T-NUMBERS WHICH ARE
2.0/2.5/2.0...SO THAT IVAN IS A BORDER LINE TROPICAL STORM. THE
INITIAL ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 35 KNOTS...ALTHOUGH THE FORECAST IS FOR
WEAKENING TO DEPRESSION INTENSITY IN 24 HOURS IN LINE WITH FORECAST
OF INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR.  THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO RETURN BACK
TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS IN 72 HOURS AS THE SHEAR IS REDUCED.  BOTH
THE SHIPS AND THE GFDL INTENSITY FORECASTS ALSO SUPPORT THIS.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 295/12.  THE MODEL TRACK
FORECASTS ARE IN BETTER AGREEMENT THAN IN PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND TAKE
THE SYSTEM NORTHWEST...BUT WITH VARYING SPEEDS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST REFLECTS NHC AND HPC INPUT AND IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE

A MODERATE SHEARING PATTERN PERSISTS WITH THE CIRCULATION CENTER
ESTIMATED TO BE UNDER THE WESTERN PART OF THE SMALL CENTRAL DENSE
OVERCAST.  THE INITIAL HEADING IS ADJUSTED TO 310 DEGREES AT 12 KT.
 
AN ELONGATED TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWARD FROM 30N TO SOUTHWEST OF
IVAN IS INDUCING THE CURRENT SHEAR.  IF THE DEPTH OF THIS FEATURE IS
GREAT ENOUGH IT WILL TURN THE STORM MORE TOWARD THE NORTH IN TIME
WITH THE SHEAR POTENTIALLY DECREASING.  ALTERNATELY...IF IT IS
RATHER SHALLOW...THEN IVAN COULD CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD THE WEST-
NORTHWEST BUT BECOME EVEN MORE SHEARED.  MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE
AND THE NHC FORECAST IS BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES...SUGGESTING A NW

IVAN CONTINUES TO BE SHEARED FROM THE WEST-SOUTHWEST BUT APPLICATION
OF THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE...WHICH ALLOWS FOR THAT PATTERN...SUGGESTS
THAT THE SYSTEM HAS STRENGTHENED A LITTLE.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
ESTIMATED TO BE 40 KT.  

THE HEADING APPEARS TO HAVE EASED OVER TO 320/10 KT.  MOST OF THE
GUIDANCE SHOWS A CONTINUATION OF THAT TRACK THROUGH 48 HOURS.  AFTER
THAT TIME...THE TRACKS DIVERGE WITH HEADINGS FROM WNW TO NE SHOWN. 
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS POSSIBLE DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE UPPER TROUGH

IVAN HAS ACCELERATED TO ABOUT 20 KT DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS...WITH A
12-HOUR MOTION ESTIMATED AT 355/14 KT.   THE INCREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED IS LIKELY THE RESULT OF IVAN BEING CAUGHT IN THE CIRCULATION
AROUND THE UPPER-LOW CUTTING OFF TO THE SSW.  

THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FUTURE TRACK.  AS THE
INTERACTION WITH THE UPPER LOW ENDS...SOME DECELERATION AND A TURN
MORE TOWARD THE NW ARE POSSIBLE.  THE GFDL...UKMET...NOGAPS...AND
BAMS ALL SHOW THIS.  MEANWHILE...THE OTHER GUIDANCE SHOWS A
CONTINUING RECURVATURE.  THIS OFFICIAL FORECAST LEANS BACK A LITTLE
TOWARD THE FORMER OPTION AS...AT THE MOMENT..THIS SEEMS TO BE MOST
CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT LARGE-SCALE PATTERN AND EXPECTED
EVOLUTION.

ITS DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY THE SYSTEM BASED ON THE SATELLITE-BASED 
DVORAK INTENSITY SCHEME.  IN FACT THE SYSTEM HAS SOME SUBTROPICAL-
TYPE CHARACTERISTICS.  BOTH TAFB AND SAB SHOW A WEAKENING TREND
OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE REDUCED

IS DROPPING SOUTHWARD AND IS SHEARING THE SYSTEM.  THE INTENSITY 
WILL BE HELD AT 45 KNOTS THROUGH 72 HOURS. THE SYSTEM MAY BECOME
EXTRA-TROPICAL BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD. 
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 330/12 KNOTS.  THE PRIMARY
STEERING MECHANISM FOR THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL BE THE TROUGH
TO THE WEST OF IVAN.  MOST OF THE 00 TRACK MODEL SUITE SHOW A
NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 48 HOURS WITH A TURN TO THE NORTH
THEREAFTER.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO 
AND IS SIMILAR THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN

IS IN FAIRLY CLOSE AGREEMENT SHOWING A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE
NORTH BY 24 HOURS...AND A BEND TOWARD THE NORTHEAST BY 48 HOURS.
 
FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE LATE 18Z SHIP REPORT AND EARLIER REPORTS
FROM THE SAME SHIP...ID PJOX...REPORTING AN EAST WIND OF 75 KNOTS
LOCATED ABOUT 70 NM NORTHEAST OF IVAN AT THE TIME SUGGEST THAT THE
OBS ARE DOUBLE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE.  THUS 75 KT WIND IS REALLY 37
KTS. THIS FITS WITH COMPACT WIND FIELD AS ESTIMATED BY VISIBLE AND

JEANNE CONTINUES TO INTENSIFY.  A RATHER SOLID AND MODERATE-SIZED
CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST IS APPARENT WITH A DISTINCT BAND TO THE NW
THROUGH NORTH.  T-NUMBERS ARE UP TO 3.5...SO 55 KT WILL BE THE
INITIAL WIND SPEED.
 
THE MOTION IS LITTLE CHANGED...295/15 KT.  THE 00Z NOGAPS SHOWS A
HIGH EXTENDING FROM NORTH OF JEANNE WESTWARD TO ABOUT 35W.  THIS
SHOULD KEEP THE STORM ON A WNW HEADING THROUGH 48 TO 72 HOURS.  THE
TRACK GUIDANCE AND OFFICIAL FORECAST ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH
THAT EXPECTATION.

FURTHER STRENGTHENING ALONG THE LINES OF THE SHIPS MODEL OUTPUT IS
SHOWN.

SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED
NEAR THE CENTER OF JEANNE AND THE BANDING FEATURE WRAPS ALMOST
FULLY AROUND THE SYSTEM.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB 
AND SAB ARE 4.0. THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 70 KNOTS FOR
THIS ADVISORY.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH NEAR
40W WHICH IS FORECAST BY THE GLOBAL MODELS TO PERSIST THROUGH THE
72-HOUR PERIOD.  THE ASSOCIATED SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR
WILL LIKELY LIMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF JEANNE BEYOND 24 HOURS. 
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/14 KNOTS.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE
NORTH OF JEANNE SHOULD CONTINUE TO STEER THE SYSTEM ON A GENERAL
WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE THROUGH 72 HOURS...AND MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE REFLECTS THIS AS DOES THE OFFICIAL NHC FORECAST. THIS TRACK
IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

5 PM EDT FRI SEP 25 1998

IN THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS JEANNE HAS LOOKED LESS IMPRESSIVE ON
SATELLITE IMAGERY AND DVORAK CI NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 4.5.
THEREFORE...THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS 80 KNOTS. ALTHOUGH THE
OUTFLOW ON VISIBLE IMAGERY STILL LOOKS FAIRLY WELL
ESTABLISHED...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE STORM IS BEING
IMPACTED BY WESTERLY SHEAR. THE WESTERLIES IMPACTING JEANNE APPEAR
TO BE AT A LOWER LEVEL THAN THAT OF THE CIRRUS OUTFLOW.  ALTHOUGH
THE SYNOPTIC ENVIRONMENT IS NOT IDEAL...THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL
AND GFDL MODEL SUGGEST THAT THE JEANNE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO
MAINTAIN HURRICANE INTENSITY THROUGH 72 HOURS. 
 
RECENT SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES ARE A LITTLE NORTH OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK SUGGESTING THAT JEANNE IS NOW MAKING ITS
ANTICIPATED TURN TO THE NORTH. THE CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/10
KNOTS. THE TRACK MODELS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLUSTER...WITH THE
LBAR...UKMET...AND NHC98 MODELS SLOWER AND MORE TO THE EAST OF THE
OTHER GUIDANCE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST...BUT A LITTLE FURTHER TO THE EAST.

11 PM EDT FRI SEP 25 1998

JEANNE HAS CONTINUED TO LOOK RAGGED ON IR SATELLITE IMAGERY AND
DVORAK CI NUMBERS ARE 4.5. THEREFORE THE INTENSITY IS ESTIMATED AT
75 KNOTS. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE STORM IS BEING
SHEARED BY AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. HOWEVER THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL
AND THE GFDL MODEL CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT THE STORM WILL REMAIN A
HURRICANE THROUGH 72 HOURS. IF THE SHEAR RELAXES IN THE NEXT DAY OR
SO...AS SUGGESTED BY THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IN THE
AVN FORECAST...STRENGTHENING MIGHT STILL BE POSSIBLE. AS A
COMPROMISE...THE INTENSITY IS HELD CONSTANT THROUGH 72 HOURS. 

ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE A GENERAL NORTHWARD MOTION
FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE CURRENT MOTION IS 325/9 KNOTS...BUT
AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED IS EXPECTED. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE EAST OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...SINCE THE
GFDL...UKMET...AND LBAR MODELS INDICATE A NORTH NORTHEAST MOTION
AFTER 48 HOURS.

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER REMAINS UNDER THE DENSE CONVECTIVE
OVERCAST...AND CURRENT DVORAK CI NUMBERS FROM THE TROPICAL
PREDICTION CENTER AND THE SYNOPTIC ANALYSIS BRANCH ARE 4.0.  THUS
THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS 65 KNOTS.  NO SIGNIFICANT
CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST.  HOWEVER THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT
PARTICULARLY HOSTILE...SO THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE THAT
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  NEAR THE END
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...COOLER WATERS ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE
WEAKENING.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 12Z GFDL MODEL GUIDANCE.

LATEST FIXES SHOW THAT THE MOTION IS STILL NORTH-NORTHWESTWARD...AT
AROUND 10 KNOTS.  JEANNE IS MOVING AROUND THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A
500 MB ANTICYCLONE...AND WILL ENCOUNTER AN INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY
STEERING FLOW AFTER CROSSING 30N.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
A BLEND OF THE AVAILABLE GUIDANCE AND SHOWS ACCELERATION TO AROUND
25 KNOTS IN 48 HOURS OR SO.

THE CENTER IS NOT WELL DEFINED IN GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE IMAGERY
BUT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER APPEARS TO BE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE CENTRAL
DENSE OVERCAST.  AN SSM/I PASS FROM 26/2215Z CAUGHT ABOUT HALF OF
THE CIRCULATION...AND HELPS A LITTLE WITH THE LOCATION.  INITIAL
INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 70 KNOTS WHICH IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN
VARIOUS SATELLITE ESTIMATES.  THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT PARTICULARLY
HOSTILE...SO SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST UNTIL THE
SYSTEM MOVES OVER COOLER WATER.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 340/10.  JEANNE IS BEING STEERED AROUND
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE...AND IS ABOUT TO
BE INFLUENCED BY A BROAD MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE WEST.
RECURVATURE WITH ACCELERATION IS FORECAST.  THE CURRENT TRACK IS
BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS A REASONABLE

SINCE THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 70
KNOTS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE SYSTEM EMBEDDED IN A MUCH
LARGER ANTICYCLONE... SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED TO HURRICANE IVAN

POSSIBLE.  IN ANY EVENT...JEANNE SHOULD BE LOSING TROPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS AFTER IT PASSES THE AZORES.

THE HURRICANE CONTINUES TO MOVE AROUND THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A
LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH OVER THE EASTERN ATLANTIC...AND WILL
BEGIN TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE HIGHER-LATITUDE WESTERLIES SOON.  THE
CURRENT MOTION IS SLIGHTLY EAST OF NORTH AND THE TRACK

ALTHOUGH THE FORWARD SPEED HAS INCREASED TODAY...TO AROUND 15
KNOTS...THE 18Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS CONSIDERABLY SLOWER THAN
BEFORE.  THE LATEST AVN FORECAST AT 500 MB FORECASTS THE RIDGE OVER
THE EASTERN ATLANTIC TO BUILD NORTHWARD MORE THAN PREVIOUSLY
INDICATED.  AS A RESULT...THE STRONGER WESTERLIES SHIFT FARTHER
NORTH...AND THE STEERING FLOW DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD IS NOT AS
FAST AS SHOWN IN THE PREVIOUS MODEL RUN.  CONSEQUENTLY...THE CURRENT
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SLOWER THAN THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
PACKAGE.  HOWEVER IT STILL HAS JEANNE APPROACHING THE AZORES IN
ABOUT 48 HOURS.

INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE UNCHANGED...AVERAGING AROUND 70 KNOTS.  THE
CENTER IS STILL UNDER THE DEEP CONVECTION.  LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH IS PREDICTED UNTIL THE SYSTEM PASSES THE AZORES...AT WHICH
TIME IT WILL LIKELY BE LOSING ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS.  HOWEVER
THERE ARE NOW SOME INDICATIONS THAT INCREASING SHEAR COULD WEAKEN

HURRICANE INTENSITY.  THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS STILL UNDER THE DEEP

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING SHOWS THAT JEANNE IS A
HEALTHY HURRICANE.  THE CENTER IS EMBEDDED WITHIN AN AREA OF DEEP
CONVECTION WITH DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB
AT 4.5.  ACCORDINGLY...THE INTENSITY WILL BE INCREASED TO 75 KNOTS.
THE OUTFLOW IS FAIRLY WELL-DEVELOPED OVER MOST OF THE SYSTEM AND
ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE
STUDIES...CIMSS..INDICATE THAT A LOW VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ENVIRONMENT
SHOULD PERSIST FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  JEANNE SHOULD WEAKEN BELOW
HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 36 HOURS AS IT APPROACHES PROGRESSIVELY COOLER
WATERS...23-24 DEG C.  THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO EXTRA-TROPICAL
STATUS BY 48 HOURS.
 
SATELLITE FIXES SUGGEST THAT JEANNE HAS ACCELERATED A BIT OVER THE
LAST 12 HOURS AND IS NOW MOVING NEAR 025/20 KNOTS.  THE MID-LEVEL
TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH NEAR 60W WHICH IS STEERING THIS SYSTEM IS
FORECAST TO MOVE NORTHEAST AND DE-AMPLIFY.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW THE
FORWARD MOTION TO SLOW AS THE TRACK BENDS TO THE EAST-NORTHEAST.
THE TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS TWO PRIMARY SOLUTIONS WITH ONE GROUP OF
MODELS KEEPING THE SYSTEM ON A NORTH-NORTHEAST TO NORTHEAST COURSE
AND ANOTHER MOVING JEANNE NORTHEAST THROUGH 24 HOURS WITH A EAST
TO SOUTHEASTERLY TRACK BEYOND.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE SHOWING A EAST-NORTHEAST MOTION AFTER

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON SEP 28 1998
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW A LARGE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION.
THE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATE DEPENDS ON WHERE THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER
IS LOCATED IN RELATION TO THE DEEP CONVECTION...AND THERE IS OVER 60
NMI SCATTER IN THE FIXES FROM SAB...TAFB...AND KGWC.  INITIAL
INTENSITY REMAINS AT 80 KNOTS...WHICH IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN
VARIOUS SATELLITE ESTIMATES.  GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST SINCE
JEANNE IS BEGINNING TO MOVE OVER WATER COOLER THAN 26C.  THE SYSTEM
WILL LIKELY BECOME EXTRATROPICAL WITHIN 36 TO 48 HOURS.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 040/18.  CONSIDERABLE SCATTER EXISTS IN
THE GUIDANCE MODELS...BUT NEARLY ALL SUGGEST THAT STEERING CURRENTS
WILL CONTINUE THE NORTHEASTWARD MOTION FOR ANOTHER 24 HOURS OR SO. 
THEREAFTER...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE SHOULD BE CAUGHT UP IN THE
WESTERLIES.  CURRENT TRACK IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE MID LAYER BAM AND AVIATION
MODELS.  THE UKMET AND GFDL SUGGEST A LITTLE MOTION SOUTH OF EAST
AFTER 36 OR 48 HOURS...WHICH IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER ON IR IMAGERY.  WHILE DEEP
CONVECTION IS PRESENT...IT IS NOT WELL-ORGANIZED AND THE SYSTEM
APPEARS TO BE UNDER WESTERLY SHEAR.  DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE DECREASING
BUT CI NUMBERS ARE UNCHANGED...AND SO IS THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM WIND
SPEED...80 KT.
 
EVEN WITH THE UNCERTAINTY IN POSITIONING...IT APPEARS THAT THE TRACK
OF JEANNE HAS TURNED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT.  INITIAL MOTION IS NEAR
060/18 KT.  ONE SHORT-WAVE TROUGH IS BYPASSING JEANNE TO THE
NORTH...BUT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE HURRICANE SHOULD
GRADUALLY BECOME PICKED UP BY THE WESTERLIES DURING THE NEXT DAY OR
TWO.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A MORE EASTWARD TRACK WITH TIME. 
THIS TAKES JEANNE INTO COOL WATERS WHERE WEAKENING AND A TRANSITION
TO EXTRATROPICAL IS LIKELY.

THE SYSTEM COULD BRING TROPICAL STORM OR...LESS LIKELY...HURRICANE
CONDITIONS TO THE AZORES WITHIN ABOUT 24 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 060/09.
 
MODEL GUIDANCE...
THE AVIATION MODEL AND NOGAPS SHOW A MOSTLY NORTHEASTWARD MOTION
THROUGH 72 HOURS WHILE THE GFDL AND LBAR SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE
EAST.  THE UKMET SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH APPARENTLY IN
RESPONSE TO A FRONTAL LOW TO THE WEST OF THE STORM OVERTAKING IT AND
ADVECTING IT NORTHWARD.  THE BAM MODELS SUGGEST THAT A STRONGER
SYSTEM WITH MORE VERTICAL EXTENT WILL HAVE MORE OF AN EASTWARD
COMPONENT THAN A WEAKER SHEARED SYSTEM.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A CONSENSUS OF THE MODELS AND IS A
LITTLE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST...BASED ON A CONTINUATION
OF THE SHEARING WHICH IS OCCURRING.
 
THIS SHEARING IS CAUSING THE LOW LEVEL CENTER TO BE EXPOSED TO THE
WEST OF THE CONVECTION AND IS THE BASIS FOR DECREASING THE CURRENT
WIND SPEED TO 50 KNOTS AND FOR FORECASTING CONTINUED WEAKENING.
COOLER SSTS ALSO ARE PART OF THE REASONING FOR WEAKENING.  THE
OVERTAKING FRONTAL LOW MAY ALSO BE THE MECHANISM FOR CAUSING JEANNE
TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL...PERHAPS IN 24 TO 36 HOURS...IF NOT SOONER.

TROPICAL STORM LISA DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON OCT 05 1998
 
THE STRONG TROPICAL WAVE THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR SEVERAL
DAYS DISPLAYED A FAIRLY WELL DEFINED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION ON
VISIBLE IMAGERY TODAY.  THE WEST HALF OF THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION
IS EXPOSED BUT THERE IS DEEP CONVECTION ON THE EAST SIDE.  AN
OBSERVATION OF 45 KNOTS FROM A DRIFTING BOUY IN THE DEEP CONVECTION
AT ABOUT 11Z IS THE BASIS FOR CALLING THIS SYSTEM A TROPICAL STORM. 
LISA MAY HAVE BEEN A STORM FOR 18 HOURS OR MORE...BUT IT WAS NOT
UNTIL THE CENTER BECAME VISIBLE THIS MORNING THAT THIS WAS KNOWN TO
BE THE CASE.  THE SHEARING IMPLIED BY THE EXPOSED CENTER AND STRONG
WESTERLIES IS THE BASIS ASSUMING THAT WEAKENING HAS OCCURRED TODAY.

THE TRACK GUIDANCE ALL SHOWS THE SYSTEM BEING RECURVED BY A MAJOR
TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES IN 72 HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
IS SIMILAR TO THE GFDL AND AVIATION AND LBAR MODELS.  A POSSIBILTY
IS THAT A STRONG BAROCLINIC SYSTEM WILL ABSORB THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
...RESULTING IN A STRONGER SYSTEM THAN FORECAST IN THIS ADVISORY.
THE FORECAST TRACK INDICATES NO THREAT TO LAND.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON OCT 05 1998

LOCATING THE CENTER ON SHEARED TROPICAL CYCLONES WITH INFRARED
IMAGERY IS USUALLY QUITE DIFFICULT...AND THIS ONE IS NO EXCEPTION. 
HOWEVER THE TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTERS INFRARED COMBINATION CHANNEL
IMAGERY REVEALS ENOUGH OF THE LOW CLOUD LINES OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE SO THAT THE CENTER IS ESTIMATED NEAR THE SOUTHWEST EDGE
OF THE MAIN DENSE OVERCAST.  THIS LOCATION GIVES A SLIGHTLY SLOWER
FORWARD SPEED...305/10.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A HIGH
AMPLITUDE MID-TROPOSPHERIC PATTERN...WITH A MAJOR TROUGH DIGGING IN
THE WEST-CENTRAL ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 
CONSISTENT WITH THIS STEERING PATTERN...THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST...AND SO DOES THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THIS IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE TRACK FORECAST FROM
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. 

AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW IN THE VICINITY OF 21N 54W IS CONTRIBUTING TO
SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR OVER THE TROPICAL STORM.  CURRENT
INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS NEAR 40 KNOTS.  LISA HAS A FAIRLY LARGE
CIRCULATION AND IT MAY BE MORE RESILIENT TO SHEAR THAN A VERY SMALL
STORM...WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE DISSIPATING IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT. 
HOWEVER THE SHEARING IS NOT EXPECTED TO RELAX SO STRENGTHENING IS
NOT LIKELY.  LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD OR BEYOND...LISA MAY BE
INTERACTING WITH A FRONTAL ZONE AND COULD UNDERGO SOME BAROCLINIC
DEVELOPMENT.

TONIGHT COULD BE A TRIUMPH FOR NEW...OR RELATIVELY NEW...
TECHNOLOGY.  THE CENTER OF LISA WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PINPOINT ON
CONVENTIONAL IR METEOSAT AND GOES8 IMAGERY...WITH SOME ANALYSES OF
THAT DATA GIVING A MISLEADING IMPRESSION THAT THE CENTER HAD
ACCELERATED TO ABOUT 14 KT ALONG 305 DEGREES.  ON THE OTHER
HAND...THE SPECIAL NIGHT IR CHANNEL ON THE GOES8 SPACECRAFT PROVIDES
A CLEARER VIEW. IT SHOWS THE SYSTEM TO HAVE SLOWED...TO 6 KT...AND
PERHAPS TO HAVE BEGUN ITS TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  INITIAL HEADING IS
ESTIMATED TO BE 335 DEGREES OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.
 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW NEAR 23N 54W.  FLOW
AROUND THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE LOW CONTINUES TO SHEAR LISA.  THE
00Z AVN AND NOGAPS INDICATE THAT BOTH FEATURES ARE LIKELY TO BE
FORCED N TO NE BY THE DEEP LOW TO CUTOFF FROM THE WESTERLIES OVER
THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS GENERALLY FOLLOW SUIT. 
BY 72 HOURS...THE AVN SHOWS LISA MERGING WITH THE ASSOCIATED
BAROCLINIC ZONE...BUT THERE IS SOME DOUBT AS TO WHETHER A TROPICAL
STORM AS LARGE AS THIS CAN BE SO QUICKLY AND COMPLETELY ABSORBED AT
SUCH A LOW LATITUDE...NEAR 30N.  THE NOGAPS SHOWS A HYBRID SYSTEM
EVENTUALLY DEVELOPING FROM THE INTERACTION.  EITHER WAY...
SIGNIFICANT NORTHWARD ACCELERATION IS LIKELY BY 72 HOURS.
 
ALTHOUGH DEEP CONVECTION HAS RECENTLY DIMINISHED IN COVERAGE...
INTENSIFICATION IS POSSIBLE IN THE SHORT TERM IF LISA BEGINS TO MOVE
TOWARD THE NE.  THE STORM COULD ALSO STRENGTHEN LATER ON IN RESPONSE
TO BAROCLINIC EFFECTS.  BOTH THE SHIPS AND GFDL SCHEMES INDICATE
STRENGTHENING.

LISA HAS BEGUN TO MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST ABOUT 10 KNOTS AHEAD OF
A MAJOR MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC AND AROUND
A LARGE UPPER-LOW CENTERED NEAR 21N 55W.  THIS PATTERN IS PRODUCING
MID TO UPPER LEVEL WESTERLIES BASICALLY OVER MOST OF THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC AND THE CARIBBEAN AS CLEARLY SEEN ON WV IMAGES.  IN
RESPONSE TO THAT PATTERN...LISA HAS RECURVED AND IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE ON THIS GENERAL NORTHEASTWARD TRACK WITH A GRADUAL INCREASE
IN FORWARD SPEED OVER OPEN WATER THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS.
 
SINCE LISA IS MOVING NORTHEASTWARD...ON THE SAME DIRECTION OF THE
UPPER FLOW...THE RELATIVE SHEAR HAS DECREASED AND CONSEQUENTLY THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS CURRENTLY BACK UNDER THE CONVECTION. THIS
SUGGESTS THAT LISA COULD BE A LITTLE STRONGER THAN INDICATED BUT WE
WOULD RATHER WAIT TO SEE IF THE CENTER REMAINS UNDER THE OVERCAST TO
ADJUST THE INITIAL INTENSITY.  NEVERTHELESS...ONLY A SMALL
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.

11 PM EDT TUE OCT 06 1998

THE STORM CONTINUES TO BE SHEARED BY SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ASSOCIATED
WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW LOCATED NEAR 21N 53W.  SINCE LISA IS MOVING
NORTHEASTWARD...THE SHEAR IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT WOULD BE FOR A
WESTWARD-MOVING TROPICAL CYCLONE...BUT STILL STRONG ENOUGH TO
PREVENT SIGNIFICANT INTENSIFICATION.   THE UPPER LOW APPEARS TO BE
DRIFTING SOUTHEASTWARD.  IF THE UPPER LOW CONTINUES MOVING SOUTHEAST
AND LISA CONTINUES MOVING NORTHEAST...THE HIGH-LEVEL FLOW OVER THE
STORM MAY BECOME MORE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING IN A DAY OR SO. 
ON THE OTHER HAND...THE LARGE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH FARTHER TO
THE NORTH WILL PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED SHEAR LATER IN THE
PERIOD.  THE SHIPS MODEL...WHICH USES THE AVN MODEL FORECAST
WINDS...SHOWS SOME RELAXATION OF THE SHEAR DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS
AND AN INCREASE THEREAFTER.  GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES...INTENSITY IS
HELD CONSTANT IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  BY 72 HOURS LISA IS
EXPECTED TO BE COMBINING WITH A FRONTAL CYCLONE OVER THE CENTRAL
ATLANTIC...AND SHOULD BE LOSING ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS.

AS USUAL FOR THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM...WITHOUT VISIBLE SATELLITE
PICTURES...IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER.  HOWEVER THE
TPC 2-INFRARED CHANNEL COMBINATION IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE CENTER
IS VERY LIKELY NEAR THE SOUTHWEST EDGE OF THE MAIN CONVECTIVE
OVERCAST.  INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS JUST SLIGHTLY SLOWER...040/09.

A LARGE 500 MB TROUGH IS FORECAST BY THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL TO
PRODUCE A STRONG CUT-OFF LOW OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC IN A COUPLE
OF DAYS.  LISA IS EXPECTED TO BE STEERED NORTHEASTWARD TO NORTHWARD
AROUND THE EASTERN SIDE OF THIS LOW.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS

HIGHER BUT SINCE CONVECTION IS NOT VERY DEEP...WE WOULD RATHER KEEP
THE INTENSITY AT 50 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN IS BECOMING BETTER
ORGANIZED WITH BANDING FEATURES...A CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST...AND AN
EYE TRYING TO FORM.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT LISA IS CLOSE TO HURRICANE
STRENGTH.  WINDS ARE ADJUSTED TO 60 KNOTS AT THIS TIME BUT IF THE
EYE BECOMES EVIDENT...WE WILL HAVE TO INCREASE THE WINDS.  
 
LISA IS RACING NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD...ABOUT 24 KNOTS...AHEAD OF A
COLD FRONT.  MODELS SUGGEST THAT LISA SHOULD TURN MORE TO THE NORTH
AND BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG FRONTAL LOW.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST FOLLOWS THE MODELS AND MAKES LISA EXTRATROPICAL BY 36

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT WED OCT 21 1998
 
THE TROPICAL WAVE THAT HAS BEEN MOVING WESTWARD THROUGH THE ATLANTIC
AND THE CARIBBEAN DURING THE PAST WEEK HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED
AND BASED ON DATA FROM AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE...THE
SYSTEM HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  THE PLANE FOUND
A TIGHT CENTER OF 1001 MB AND MEASURED MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF
39 KNOTS INDICATING THAT THE DEPRESSION IS ALREADY NEAR TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH.  THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER APPEARS TO BE LOCATED TO THE
NORTH OF THE MAIN CONVECTION SUGGESTING THAT THE LARGE SCALE UPPER-
LEVEL WINDS ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING AT THIS
TIME.  HOWEVER...THE DEPRESSION IS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ITS OWN
OUTFLOW AS OBSERVED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY AND MOST OF THE MODELS ARE
FORMING A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN
IN ABOUT 36 HOURS...A PATTERN WHICH IS MORE CONDUCIVE FOR
STRENGTHENING.  IN ADDITION...BOTH SHIPS AND THE GFDL BRING THE
DEPRESSION TO HURRICANE STATUS BETWEEN 48 AND 72 HOURS...AND SO DOES
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.     
 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE INITIAL MOTION SINCE THE SYSTEM
JUST FORMED BUT THE BEST ESTIMATE IS 290/08.   ALL OF THE TRACK
MODELS...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CLIPER...TURN THE SYSTEM GRADUALLY
TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST AS A THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH
WEAKENS AND A STRONG MID-LATITUDE TROUGH SWINGS EASTWARD OVER THE
EASTERN UNITED STATES.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST PLACES A HURRICANE
BETWEEN SWAN ISLAND AND GRAND CAYMAN BY 72 HOURS...A POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN. 

TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE WATCHES AND WARNINGS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR
PORTIONS OF THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN AS EARLY AS THURSDAY. ALL
INTERESTS IN THIS AREA SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
SYSTEM.

5 AM EDT THU OCT 22 1998

SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST LITTLE CHANGE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  ALTHOUGH DEEP CONVECTION REMAINS
FAIRLY STRONG...THERE IS NOT MUCH EVIDENCE OF BANDING FEATURES SO
FAR.  NORTHERLY SHEAR HAS BEEN AFFECTING THE DEPRESSION...PROBABLY
DUE TO AN UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE LOCATED A FEW HUNDRED MILES TO THE
NORTHEAST.  HOWEVER...THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS AN
INCREASINGLY FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT OVER THE WESTERN
CARIBBEAN DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THEREFORE...STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE
STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME.

AN EARLIER RECON FIX SHOWED THAT THE CENTER WAS NEAR THE NORTHERN
EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THIS WAS ALSO SHOWN BY AN 85 GHZ IMAGE
FROM THE NAVAL RESEARCH LAB MONTEREY TROPICAL CYCLONE HOMEPAGE.  THE
CURRENT LOCATION IS RATHER UNCERTAIN BUT THE DEPRESSION APPEARS TO
HAVE MOVED MOSTLY WESTWARD SINCE THE LAST ADVISORY.   

A LARGE MID-LATITUDE TROUGH WILL BE SWEEPING OFF THE SOUTHEAST U.S.
COAST DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THE 06Z RUN OF THE NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB WEAKNESS EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD FROM THE
TROUGH INTO THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD...WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO TURN
TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  THIS IS SHOWN BY MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK
PREDICTION MODELS ALTHOUGH THE GFDL SHOWS A MORE NORTHWARD
TRACK...WITH A TURN BACK TO THE WEST NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD. 
THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY CLOSE TO THAT FROM THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR TO THE MEDIUM-DEPTH BAM
TRACK. 

INTERESTS IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM SINCE TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE WATCHES
AND WARNINGS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR SOME PORTION OF THE AREA LATER
TODAY.

ALTHOUGH TWO CONVECTIVE BANDS ARE SEEN ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE
TD...THE SYSTEM RETAINS AN OTHERWISE RATHER AMORPHOUS STRUCTURE AT
THIS POINT.  CENTER POSITION ESTIMATES REMAIN QUITE UNCERTAIN.  A
SHIP NEAR 12N 76W REPORTED EAST WINDS AT 12Z...BUT THE ACCURACY OF
THEIR WIND DIRECTION IS SOMEWHAT IN QUESTION ACCORDING TO THE MARINE
PREDICTION CENTER .  IF THE OBSERVATION IS VALID...THEN THE CENTER
OF CIRCULATION IS NOW LOCATED TO THE SE OF THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. 
THE REQUIRES SOME SOUTHEASTWARD RELOCATION OF THE CENTER POSITION...
AND IMPLIES LITTLE OR NO MOTION.  THE MOTION...STRUCTURE AND
INTENSITY SHOULD BE BETTER KNOWN AFTER THE HURRICANE HUNTERS ARRIVE
THERE THIS AFTERNOON.
 
THE 00Z NOGAPS AND 06Z AVN AND GFDL INDICATE THAT AFTER THE STRONG
500 MB SHORT-WAVE TROUGH PASSES BY TO THE NORTH...A RESIDUAL TROUGH
HANGS BACK NEAR THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST.  THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR SOME
NORTHWARD COMPONENT LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  IN CONTRAST...AT
850 MB...A LARGE ANTICYCLONE IS FORECAST TO PERSIST TO THE
NW...GIVING LOW LEVEL EASTERLIES.  IN COMBINATION...THIS
DISTRIBUTION YIELDS SOME SHEAR AND A LIGHT STEERING CURRENT TO THE
NW ON AVERAGE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS IS THE NHC FORECAST.  ALL
AVAILABLE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE ALSO SHOWS A NW HEADING.
 
AT UPPER LEVELS...THERE IS A COL LOCATED JUST NORTH OF THE TD...A
LITTLE SOUTH OF JAMAICA.  THE MODELS SHOW A MORE FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPING OVER THE CARIBBEAN DURING THE NEXT DAY OR
TWO.  BY THREE DAYS...HOWEVER...THE GFDL SHIFTS THE CENTER OF THE
200 MB ANTICYCLONE TO THE BAY OF CAMPECHE AND SHOWS A TROUGH OVER
THE NW CARIBBEAN.  THAT PATTERN WOULD NOT BE SO CONDUCIVE FOR
STRENGTHENING.

THE SLOW AND UNCERTAIN MOVEMENT ALLOWS/REQUIRES SOME DELAY IN

THE HURRICANE HUNTERS CONFIRMED THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE FOR THE
LOCATION OF THE CENTER OF CIRCULATION.  THE CYCLONE IS APPARENTLY
MOVING IN A SMALL CYCLONIC LOOP.  FOR NOW...IT WILL BE CONSIDERED
QUASI-STATIONARY.  THE AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERED 51 KT WINDS AT THE 1500
FT FLIGHT LEVEL.  USING THIS...THE SYSTEM IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL
STORM MITCH WITH 40 KT SURFACE WINDS.  THE CIRCULATION IS QUITE
SMALL WITH RADIUS OF MAXIMUM WINDS REPORTED TO BE 8 NM AT FLIGHT
LEVEL.
 
THE 12Z AVN RESEMBLES THE PREDECESSORS.  SECONDARY SHORT-WAVE
TROUGHS MOVING OFFSHORE FROM THE U.S. SE COAST LEAVE A WEAKNESS IN
THE HEIGHT FIELD IN THAT AREA AFTER THE INITIAL STRONG SYSTEM PASSES
OFFSHORE.  A MINOR RIDGE SETTLES IN OVER THE SE UNITED STATES.  THIS
ALLOWS FOR A SLOW NW TO NNW MOVEMENT DURING THE NEXT TWO DAYS...AS
SHOWN BY ALL TRACK GUIDANCE AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

IN CONTRAST TO THE RUN AT 06Z...THE 12Z GFDL SHOWS THE PRIMARY
FEATURES AT 200 MB LOCATED A LITTLE FARTHER TO THE EAST...WITH THE
ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE YUCATAN PENINSULA AND THE DOWNSTREAM
TROUGH AXIS A BIT TO THE EAST OF MITCH.  THIS IS A LITTLE MORE
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR INTENSIFICATION THAN FORECAST BY THAT
MODEL 6 HOURS AGO...AND COULD BE WHY IT IS SHOWING MORE
STRENGTHENING.  THE AVN HAS THIS COUPLET CENTERED EVEN FARTHER EAST
WITH THE HIGH NEAR MITCH--A VERY FAVORABLE PATTERN.  MITCH IS NOW
FORECAST TO REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH WITHIN 36 HOURS.

MITCH HAS COMPLETED A CYCLONIC LOOP IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN
AND NOW IS MOVING NORTHWARD ABOUT 5 KNOTS.  THIS GENERAL NORTHWARD
MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.  ONCE THE
MID-LATITUDE TROUGH CURRENTLY SWINGING ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED
STATES AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC MOVES OUT...A RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
DEVELOP IN THAT AREA.  THIS PATTERN SHOULD STEER MITCH ON A SLOW
NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.   MODELS RESPOND TO THAT BUILDING RIDGE AND
MOVE THE STORM NORTHERLY AND THEN NORTHWESTERLY.  THE MODELS
DISAGREE BEYOND 48 HOURS WHEN THE GFDL AND NOGAPS TURN THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE SLOWLY WESTWARD WHILE THE OTHERS CONTINUE TO SHOW A GENERAL
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK.   NEVERTHELESS...AT LONGER RANGE...ANOTHER
TROUGH IS FORECAST TO MOVE EASTWARD OVER THE UNITED STATES...AND
WILL PROBABLY FORCE MITCH TO MOVE MORE NORTHWARD AGAIN AS SUGGESTED
BY NOGAPS AND THE UK MODELS.  BOTH MODELS PLACE MITCH NEAR THE
YUCATAN CHANNEL BY DAY 5. IT APPEARS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE BUSY
FOR SEVERAL DAYS.
  
THE OUTFLOW IS GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND THE CENTER IS
UNDER DEEP CONVECTION.  MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS ARE DEVELOPING A

IMAGERY EXHIBITS WELL-DEFINED BANDING AND FAIR OUTFLOW OVER THE
NORTHERN PORTION OF THE SYSTEM.  SOUTHWESTERLY TO WESTERLY FLOW

STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE

MITCH HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE NORTHWARD THIS MORNING AND THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS 010/06 KNOTS. THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE
FOR THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A GRADUAL BEND TOWARD 
THE NORTH-NORTHWEST...THEN NORTHWEST IS FORECAST AS THE WESTERN

MITCH IS NOT STRENGTHENING AT THIS TIME.  ALTHOUGH THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION IS WELL DEFINED...THE CONVECTION IS WEAK.  UNEXPECTED
UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLY WINDS HAVE BECOME ESTABLISHED OVER THE SYSTEM
DISRUPTING THE EXCELLENT OUTFLOW WHICH WAS OBSERVED YESTERDAY.
INITIAL INTENSITY IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS IN THIS ADVISORY...BUT A
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE WILL DETERMINE IF MITCH HAS WEAKENED AS
SUSPECTED.   ALL AVAILABLE MODELS SUGGEST THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE SHOULD FORM OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN WITHIN THE NEXT
24 HOURS OR SO.  SUCH A PATTERN WOULD PROVIDE EXCELLENT CONDITIONS 
FOR STRENGTHENING AND IN FACT...BOTH SHIPS AND THE GFDL MODELS BRING
MITCH TO A 75- AND 100-KNOT HURRICANE... RESPECTIVELY.  HOWEVER...IT
IS DIFFICULT TO VISUALIZE SUCH INTENSIFICATION WITH THE PRESENT
POORLY DEFINED PATTERN OBSERVED ON SATELLITE IMAGES AND KNOWING THAT
THE GLOBAL MODELS TEND TO GET RID OF WESTERLIES TOO FAST.  AT THIS
TIME...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR NO CHANGE IN INTENSITY DURING

BEGIN. 

MITCH HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY AND LITTLE MOTION IS FORECAST

5 PM EDT FRI OCT 23 1998

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
MITCH HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE DAY. IT CONTINUES TO
HAVE WELL DEFINED CLOUD BANDS WRAPPING AROUND THE SYSTEM BUT LACKS
OF DEEP CONVECTION AND CENTRAL FEATURES.  RECON JUST MEASURED A
MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 997 MB NAD 50 KNOT WINDS.  THE WESTERLY WINDS
ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LOW WHICH FORMED JUST WEST OF THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE IS DISRUPTING THE OUTFLOW AND AS LONG THIS FEATURE IS
PRESENT STRENGTHENING IS NOT LIKELY.  UNANIMOUSLY...ALL MODELS
WEAKEN THE UPPER-LOW AND DEVELOP A SIGNIFICANT 200 MB ANTICYCLONE
OVER MITCH. HOWEVER...THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS OF WESTERLIES
RELAXING AT THIS TIME.  IF THE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE FORMS...IT
WOULD BE AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR STRENGTHENING AND IN FACT...BOTH
SHIPS AND THE GFDL MODELS BRING MITCH TO HURRICANE STATUS.  KNOWING
THAT THE GLOBAL MODELS TEND TO GET RID OF UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES TOO
FAST...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN
INTENSITY DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND IF MITCH SURVIVES...THEN
STRENGTHENING SHOULD BEGIN.

MITCH HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY OR JUST A NORTH-NORTHWEST DRIFT.  A
MID-LEVEL TROUGH LOCATED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES
IS FORECAST TO MOVE OUT OF THE AREA AND BE REPLACED BY A RIDGE. 
CONSEQUENTLY...A SLOW NORTH-NORTHWEST AND THEN NORTHWEST TRACK
SHOULD BEGIN IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE
MODELS WHICH ARE FORECASTING MITCH TO STAY OVER THE NORTHWESTERN
CARIBBEAN FOR THE NEXT 3 TO 5 DAYS.

IT APPEARS THAT SOME DEEP CONVECTION HAS RETURNED TO THE
CIRCULATION OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS AND THE TREND IS FOR THIS
CLOUDINESS TO BE GETTING A LITTLE BETTER ORGANIZED AS A CDO TYPE
AREA.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE TO UP 55 KNOTS.  THE LAST
RECON FOUND MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 50 KNOTS NORTHEAST OF THE
CENTER.  THE HRD OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS GIVES A MAX WIND OF 43 KNOTS.
THE INITIAL OFFICIAL WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST
IS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING FOLLOWING THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL AND
THE ABSENCE OF ANY OBVIOUS NEGATIVE FACTORS TO INHIBIT DEVELOPMENT. 
A REMINDER THAT INTENSITY FORECAST SKILL IS QUITE LIMITED AND
INTENSIFICATION COULD OCCUR MUCH FASTER THAN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...ESPECIALLY IF THE SHORT TERM CONVECTIVE TREND TURNS OUT
TO BE A SERIOUS ONE.
 
ALL OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW SLOW MOTION FOR 72 HOURS...MOSTLY
NORTHWESTWARD...EXCEPT THE AVIATION AND GFDL MODELS WHICH ARE
NORTHWARD FOLLOWED BY A TURN TOWARD THE WEST.  THIS SLOW MOTION IS
RELATED TO A 500 MB HIGH FORECAST TO REMAIN IN THE GULF OF MEXICO
AND BLOCK THE STORMS FORWARD MOTION.   THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE WITH A SLOW MOTION...MOSTLY NORTHWARD FOR 24
HOURS FOLLOWED BY A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  DUE TO THE SLOW
MOTION...THE NEW FORECAST TRACK IS ONLY SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY AT 12 AND 24 HOURS.  IN ANY CASE THERE APPEARS TO
BE NO THREAT TO LAND DURING THE NEXT TWO DAYS OR SO.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SAT OCT 24 1998
 
A RAGGED EYE BEGAN APPEARING INTERMITTENTLY AROUND 0415Z AND A
DVORAK CLASSIFICATION BY THE AFWA AT THAT TIME GAVE A T-NUMBER OF
4.5.  THE 06Z TAFB AND SAB ESTIMATES WERE 4.5 AND 4.0...
RESPECTIVELY.  THE HURRICANE HUNTERS ARRIVED IN THE AREA ABOUT 06Z
AND FOUND THE CENTER TO BE A LITTLE TO THE SE OF THE POSITION
INFERRED FROM SATELLITE PICTURES.  THEY ALSO FOUND HINTS OF AN EYE
...992 MB PRESSURE...AND 64 KT AT 850 MB. TWO HOURS LATER...THEY HAD
A PARTIAL EYEWALL...988 MB...AND 91 KT AT 850 MB.  BASED ON THESE
DATA...THE SURFACE WIND SPEED ESTIMATE IS INCREASED TO 80 KT.
 
MITCH HAS BEEN MOVING TOWARD 015 DEGREES AT ABOUT 5 KT OVER THE PAST
6 TO 12 HOURS.  THIS MOTION COULD HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY THE
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH DROPPING OFF THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST.  THAT
FEATURE IS FORECAST TO MOVE EASTWARD AND TO BE FOLLOWED BY RIDGING. 
THERE WAS NO 00Z RUN OF THE GFDL...BUT THE REMAINING TRACK MODELS
AND THE 18Z GFDL RESPOND TO THESE STEERING FEATURES BY SHOWING A
RATHER SHARP BEND IN THE TRACK TOWARD THE LEFT AFTER ABOUT 24 HOURS.
IN FACT...NONE OF THE DYNAMIC MODELS HAVE MITCH NORTH OF 17N BY 36
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GENERALLY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE...BUT
MAKES THE TURN TOWARD THE WEST A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH THEN ALL BUT
ONE OF THE MODELS...ABOUT 100 NM SOUTH OF JAMAICA.  THIS MIGHT BE
CLOSE ENOUGH THAT A TROPICAL STORM WATCH...OR POSSIBLY A HURRICANE
WATCH...COULD BE NECESSARY LATER TODAY FOR THAT ISLAND.
 
WITH STRENGTHENING HAVING RESUMED...AND A FUTURE ENVIRONMENT
FAVORING ADDITIONAL INTENSIFICATION...THE WIND SPEED IS FORECAST TO
INCREASE.
 
THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED USING THE RECON DATA AND
OBSERVATIONS FROM SHIP ZCBN5.

FOR JAMAICA VERY SOON.
 
AN IMPRESSIVE CDO HAS FORMED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS IN

ADVISORY.  THERE IS ALSO A HINT OF AN EYE-TYPE FEATURE FORMING.
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE UP TO 90 KNOTS.  THE INITIAL WIND

THE HURRICANE IS MOVING 355 DEGREES AT 5 KNOTS.  DYNAMICAL MODELS
ARE DEVELOPING A VERY STRONG MID-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER
THE GULF OF MEXICO DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND CONSEQUENTLY...THE
HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO CHANGE FROM THE CURRENT NORTHWARD TRACK
TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND WEST.  IN FACT...THE LATEST GFDL MOVES
MITCH TOWARD THE WEST AND WEST-SOUTHWEST AND KEEPS IT MEANDERING
NEAR THE NORTHEASTERN TIP OF HONDURAS.  ONLY CLIPER CONTINUES TO
SHOW A NORTHWARD TRACK.   I WOULD RATHER FOLLOW STATE OF THE ART
DYNAMICAL AND GLOBAL MODELS AND FORECAST THE WESTWARD TURN. 

RECON JUST MEASURED A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 976 MB AND A DROPSONDE IN
THE EYEWALL MEASURED 93 KNOTS AT LOW LEVELS.  SATELLITE IMAGES
REVEAL THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN IS BECOMING MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED WITH
A WELL DEFINED EYE AND EXCELLENT OUTFLOW IN ALL QUADRANTS.  MODELS
DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN DEVELOPING THE 200MB ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
HURRICANE...CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS EXPECTED YESTERDAY. SHIPS AND THE
GFDL CONTINUE TO FORECAST AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR STRENGTHENING. 
THEREFORE...MITCH IS EXPECTED TO REACH AT LEAST 120 KNOTS BY 36
HOURS.

DUE TO THE CURRENT NORTHWARD MOTION...A HURRICANE WARNING HAS BEEN
ISSUED FOR JAMAICA AND A HURRICANE WATCH FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN
CUBA.  HOWEVER...DUE TO THE FORECAST NORTHWEST TURN OF THE HURRICANE
...CUBA SHOULD BE READY TO EXTEND OR SHIFT THE HURRICANE WATCH TO
CENTRAL OR WESTERN CUBA...AND THE CAYMAN ISLANDS SHOULD BE READY TO
ISSUE A WATCH OR A WARNING.  

NOTE: THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HURRICANE WHICH IS FORECAST TO
MOVE VERY SLOWLY THROUGH THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN DURING THE NEXT
SEVERAL DAYS.  THIS WOULD ALLOW SOME TIME FOR THE LONG RANGE PATTERN
TO CHANGE AND CONSEQUENTLY A FUTURE CHANGE IN THE TRACK.  INTERESTS
IN THE ENTIRE WESTERN CARIBBEAN SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THIS

SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW A VERY WELL DEFINED EYE EMBEDDED
WITHIN A COLD CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST.  HURRICANE HUNTERS RECENTLY
REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 949 MB WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT
PRESSURE DROP OF 27 MB OVER 13 HOURS.  MAX WINDS FROM A FLIGHT LEVEL
OF 10000 FEET ARE 119 KNOTS SO FAR.  SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS ARE
ESTIMATED AT 110 KNOTS.  THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW REMAINS VERY WELL
ESTABLISHED...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR ADDITIONAL
STRENGTHENING.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST SHIPS AND GFDL
GUIDANCE.

THE NOAA JET FLEW IN THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE HURRICANE YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND FOUND A NARROW MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF MITCH.  THIS RIDGE HAS TURNED THE HURRICANE MORE TOWARD THE
WEST-NORTHWEST...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 295/06. 
HOWEVER...MOST MODELS WEAKEN THIS RIDGE WITH TIME.  NEAR THE END OF
THIS FORECAST PERIOD A 500 MB ANTICYCLONE SHOULD BE CENTERED OVER
THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND A BROAD TROUGH SHOULD PERSIST OVER
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...BUT THESE FEATURES APPEAR TO BE TOO FAR AWAY
FROM THE HURRICANE TO PRODUCE ANY WELL-DEFINED STEERING FOR MITCH.
WEAK STEERING CURRENTS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN
AND WE COULD SEE SOME MEANDERING OF THE HURRICANE IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS.  CURRENT TRACK CONTINUES THE GENERAL MOTION TOWARD THE WEST
NORTHWEST BUT WITH A DECREASE IN THE FORWARD SPEED.  THE GFDL AND
UKMET MODELS BOTH PRACTICALLY STALL THE HURRICANE AFTER 36 HOURS
...WHILE THE NAVY NOGAPS CONTINUES A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION TOWARD THE
NORTH COAST OF HONDURAS.

NOTE: THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HURRICANE WHICH IS FORECAST TO

BUT ANOTHER PLANE IS DUE TO MAKE A CENTER FIX AROUND 05Z...AND WE
SHALL SEE IF MITCH HAS STRENGTHENED EVEN MORE.  SINCE THE SHEAR IS
WEAK AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE WARMER THAN 29 DEG C OVER THE
AREA...SOME ADDITIONAL INTENSIFICATION COULD TAKE PLACE.
 
THE EYE HAS WOBBLED A BIT TO THE LEFT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS
BUT CURRENT MOVEMENT IS ESTIMATED TO BE WESTWARD AROUND 7 KNOTS.
STEERING CURRENTS ARE NOT WELL-DEFINED.  ONE KEY FACTOR FOR THE
STEERING OF MITCH DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS IS HOW MUCH MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGING THERE WILL BE TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE.
TRACK PREDICTION MODELS ARE GIVING A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS...BUT THE
LATEST GLOBAL MODEL RUNS SHOW THE 500 MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF MITCH
WEAKENING SOMEWHAT DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS IS ALSO
INDICATED BY THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN WHICH SHOWS A MORE
NORTHWARD...BUT SLOW...MOTION DEVELOPING SOON.   A NORTHWARD TURN IS
ALSO SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...BUT LATER IN THE PERIOD. 
REGARDLESS...THIS TRACK STILL KEEPS MITCH OVER THE NORTHWEST
CARIBBEAN FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS.
 
DUE TO THE CURRENT WESTWARD TRACK...HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE
RECOMMENDED FOR THE NORTHEASTERN COAST OF HONDURAS.  IT WAS NOT
POSSIBLE TO COORDINATE THESE WARNINGS WITH THE METEOROLOGICAL
SERVICE OF THAT COUNTRY DUE TO COMMUNICATIONS DIFFICULTIES.

U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVES REPORTED A 10 NMI DIAMETER EYE WITH A
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 923 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A
SYMMETRIC HURRICANE WITH A WELL DEFINED EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN VERY
COLD CONVECTIVE TOPS.  SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS ARE STILL ESTIMATED
AT 130 KNOTS.  THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN IS WELL ESTABLISHED
AND SOME FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS STILL POSSIBLE TODAY.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS GENERALLY TOWARD THE WEST.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND CONTINUES TO
BE A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS.  THE STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF THE HURRICANE AND HOW THIS CHANGES WITH TIME IS CRUCIAL.
THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL INDICATES A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION AS DOES
THE UKMET MODEL.  THE GFDL AND AVIATION MODELS SHOW THE RIDGE
WEAKENING AND INDICATE A MORE NORTHWARD...BUT SLOW...TRACK.  IN ANY
CASE...THE MOTION FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS IS EXPECTED TO BE SLOW
WHICH LEAVES THE HURRICANE OVER THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/07...NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM THE LAST
ADVISORY.  THE 06Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE HURRICANE MEANDERING
NORTH AND THEN NORTHEASTWARD FOR 72 HOURS.  ALL OF THE TRACK MODELS
SHOW VERY LITTLE MOTION AS A HIGH OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO DRIFTS 
SOUTHWESTWARD AND BLOCKS THE HURRICANE.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
DRIFTS THE HURRICANE SLOWLY WESTWARD AND THEN NORTHWARD...BUT SUCH
SLOW FORWARD SPEED MAKES THE DIRECTION OF MOTION HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.

THE MAXIMUM 1-MIN SURFACE WIND IS INCREASED TO 135 KNOTS BASED ON
7.0 TO 7.5 DVORAK T NUMBERS.  THIS IS STILL A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE
OF THE WIND SPEED.  A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST AFTER 24 HOURS
FOLLOWING THE SHIPS STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL WHICH
INDICATES THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY FOR A TROPICAL CYCLONE TO
MAINTAIN 135 KT WINDS FOR 72 HOURS. 

I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONTACT BELIZE OR HONDURAS FOR THIS ADVISORY. 
IT MAY SOON BE TIME TO CONSIDER A HURRICANE WATCH FOR BELIZE AND THE
REMAINDER OF THE NORTH COAST OF HONDURAS.

MITCH CONTINUES TO INTENSIFY.  THE LATEST RECON CENTRAL PRESSURE IS
906 MB.  A WIND SPEED OF 173 KNOTS WAS MEASURED FROM A GPS
DROPSONDE AT 500 FT AT ABOUT 1900Z.  THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO
155 KNOTS AT 21Z ON THIS BASIS.  THIS MAY BE THE STRONGEST ATLANTIC
BASIN HURRICANE IN RECENT YEARS TO BE OBSERVED AS LATE AS OCTOBER
26.  IT IS CLIMATOLOGICALLY UNLIKELY FOR THIS STRENGTH TO PERSIST
AND A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS...BUT
MITCH IS EXPECTED STILL BE A VERY DANGEROUS HURRICANE IN THREE DAYS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/07.  ONCE AGAIN THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE SLOW MOTION WITH A 500 MB HIGH PERSISTING
OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO.  THE GFDL MEANDERS THE HURRICANE
NORTHWARD AND SHOWS A POSITION STILL IN THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN IN
FIVE (5) DAYS.  THE NOGAPS SHOWS A SLOW TURN TOWARD THE NORTH IN
THREE DAYS AND THE UKMET SHOWS A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION...REACHING
BELIZE OR MEXICO IN THREE DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND OF
THE ABOVE MODELS SHOWING VERY SLOW MOTION FOR 72 HOURS WITH A TURN
TO THE NORTH.
 
IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHICH COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES IN THE NORTHWEST
CARIBBEAN ARE MOST THREATENED.  THE PROXIMITY OF THE HURRICANE TO
HONDURAS MOTIVATED THE GOVERNMENT OF HONDURAS TO ISSUE A HURRICANE
WARNING FOR ALL OF THEIR COASTLINE.

THE EYE CONTINUES TO BE EXTREMELY WELL-DEFINED AND THE UPPER-
TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW REMAINS VERY IMPRESSIVE.  LATEST DVORAK
CLASSIFICATIONS FROM SAB IN WASHINGTON AND THE TPC CONTINUE TO
SUPPORT A CURRENT INTENSITY OF 155 KNOTS...HOWEVER THERE HAS BEEN
SOME EROSION OF THE COLD CLOUD TOPS OVER THE NORTHWEST SEMICIRCLE OF
THE HURRICANE...WHICH IS BELIEVED TO BE A TEMPORARY CONDITION.  IT
IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR HURRICANES TO MAINTAIN SUCH GREAT INTENSITY FOR
VERY LONG...BUT HURRICANES SUCH AS THESE ARE RARE EVENTS THEMSELVES.

MITCH WILL LIKELY REMAIN AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HURRICANE FOR AT
LEAST A DAY OR TWO.  THE MAIN FACTOR GOVERNING WHETHER MITCH WILL
MAINTAIN SUCH INTENSITY...OTHER THAN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES
WHICH CAN CAUSE SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS...IS INCREASED VERTICAL
SHEAR.  THIS SHEAR MAY BE PRODUCED BY STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL
WESTERLIES TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE...WHICH COULD EVENTUALLY
IMPINGE ON MITCH.

MOTION CONTINUES TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST.  OUR TRACK PREDICTION
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO BE ANYTHING BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD.  THE 500 MB
HIGH OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH MITCH ON A
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TO WESTWARD PATH TOWARD BELIZE OR YUCATAN...AND
THIS IS SHOWN BY THE BETA/ADVECTION MODELS AND THE U.K. MET. OFFICE
GLOBAL MODEL.  ON THE OTHER HAND THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...NOGAPS...
AND THE BAROTROPIC MODEL SHOW A TURN TO THE NORTH IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS.  THE LATTER TRACK IS CONSISTENT WITH A SUBTLE WESTWARD SHIFT
OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED RIDGE IN THE MODEL FORECAST...WHICH COULD
LEAVE A SLIGHT OPENING TO THE NORTH OF MITCH.  THE LATEST GFDL RUN
SHOWS A SLOW MEANDERING MOTION DEVELOPING IN 12 TO 24 HOURS...AND
PERSISTING THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST...LIKE THE
PREVIOUS ONE...SHOWS A SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED IN 12 HOURS OR
SO WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  THE
LONGER-TERM MOVEMENT OF MITCH REMAINS SHROUDED IN UNCERTAINTY.

IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT...BASED ON THE 905 MB CENTRAL
PRESSURE MEASURED FROM THE AIRCRAFT EARLIER TODAY...MITCH IS TIED AS
THE FOURTH STRONGEST HURRICANE OBSERVED IN THE ATLANTIC BASIN.  HERE
ARE THE RANKINGS:

GILBERT (1988)...888 MB

...CORRECTION TO 4TH PARAGRAPH...
 
THE LATEST DATA FROM THE U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF MITCH HAS
RISEN A BIT THIS MORNING...UP TO 917 MB. HOWEVER...THE DROPSONDE
RECORDED 164 KNOTS AT 900 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO DEPICT
A REMARKABLY WELL-DEFINED EYE AND IMPRESSIVE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW.
AS SUSPECTED EARLIER THE EROSION OF THE COLD CLOUD TOPS WITHIN THE
NORTHWEST SEMICIRCLE OF THE HURRICANE WAS TEMPORARY. IN FACT...THE
CLOUD CANOPY SURROUNDING THE EYE HAS EXPANDED AND COOLED...WITH
TOPS TO -80 DEG C IN ALL QUADRANTS.  THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY
WILL BE HELD AT 155 KNOTS...ALSO SUPPORTED BY TAFB AND SAB DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES. AS MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR
HURRICANES TO REACH...AND MAINTAIN...SUCH GREAT INTENSITY FOR VERY
LONG...BUT HURRICANES SUCH AS THESE ARE RARE EVENTS THEMSELVES.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
MAINTAINING MITCH AS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HURRICANE FOR AT LEAST
A DAY OR TWO.  THE MAIN FACTOR GOVERNING WHETHER MITCH WILL MAINTAIN
SUCH INTENSITY...OTHER THAN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES WHICH CAN
CAUSE SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS...IS INCREASED VERTICAL SHEAR.  THIS
SHEAR MAY BE PRODUCED BY STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES TO THE
NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE...WHICH COULD EVENTUALLY IMPINGE ON
MITCH.
 
RECONNAISSANCE FIXES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS SUGGEST MITCH IS
MOVING ALMOST DUE WEST...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW
270/07 KNOTS.  THE 00Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY
MORE FOCUSED ON A MORE WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE THROUGH 36
HOURS OR SO SUGGESTING THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
GULF OF MEXICO COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH MITCH TOWARD BELIZE OR
YUCATAN. THEREAFTER...SEVERAL MODELS...NOTABLY LBAR AND THE GFDL...
TURN THE HURRICANE NORTHWEST TO NORTH BETWEEN 48 AND 72 HOURS IN
RESPONSE TO THE WESTWARD SHIFT OF THE 500 MB ANTICYCLONE MENTIONED
ABOVE.  MEANWHILE THE AVIATION AND BETA/ADVECTION MODELS...CONTINUE
A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS IMPLYING THAT THE RIDGE
HOLDS IN.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST CONTINUES A GENERAL WESTWARD
HEADING THROUGH 12 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL SLOWING IN FORWARD SPEED
AND BEND TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST THEN NORTHWEST THEREAFTER.  THIS
REPRESENTS A MODEST LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
ALTHOUGH THE OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS MITCH OFFSHORE THE CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO THE COAST...COUPLED WITH OUR HISTORICAL 24-HOUR TRACK
ERRORS AND THE STRENGTH OF THIS HURRICANE...WARRANTS STRONG 
CONSIDERATION OF UPGRADING THE HURRICANE WATCHES FOR THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA AND BELIZE TO HURRICANE WARNINGS.  THE RESPECTIVE
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN CONTACTED...AND THE WATCHES WILL LIKELY
BE REPLACED WITH HURRICANE WARNINGS AT 0900 UTC.  MEXICO AND
GUATAMALA HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND WE ARE AWAITING WORD BACK FROM
BELIZE.
 
THE LAST OCTOBER CAT 4/5 HURRICANE IN THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN WAS
HURRICANE HATTI IN 1961 WHICH REACHED AN ESTIMATED MINIMUM CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 924 MB ON THE 30TH.

MOTION.  THE GFDL IS ALMOST STATIONARY FOR 72 HOURS AND THE NOGAPS
SHOWS A SLOW MOSTLY NORTHWARD DRIFT.   THE LBAR SHOWS A NORTHWEST
DRIFT.  THE UKMET IS FASTER THAN THE OTHERS AND MOVES THE HURRICANE
WESTWARD ACROSS BELIZE IN 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK
FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWING A SLOW WEST TO
NORTHWESTWARD DRIFT FOR 72 HOURS TO NEAR THE YUCATAN PENINSULA.  IT
WOULD ONLY TAKE A 5 KNOT ERROR IN THE FORECAST SPEED OF MOTION FOR
THE HURRICANE TO MAKE LANDFALL IN 24 TO 36 HOURS ANYWHERE IN THE
WARNING AREA FROM HONDURAS TO THE YUCATAN.

THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED 10 KNOTS BASED ON THE RAGGEDNESS OF THE
DEEPEST  CONVECTION COMPARED TO EARLIER...ALONG WITH THE 06Z RECON
DATA WHICH SHOWED THE CENTRAL PRESSURE UP 12 MB AND SOMEWHAT WEAKER
FLIGHT LEVEL WIND SPEEDS.  THE FORECAST IS FOR THE WINDS TO
GRADUALLY DECREASE TO 115 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS...BASED ON THE SHIPS

THE EYE IS BECOMING LESS DISTINCT ON SATELLITE IMAGES...AND CENTRAL
PRESSURE REPORTS FROM THE AIR FORCE AND NOAA PLANES SHOW A STEADY
RISE.  THIS INDICATES THAT MITCH HAS BEEN GRADUALLY WEAKENING. 
HOWEVER...DROPWINDSONDE DATA STILL SHOW HIGH WIND SPEEDS WHICH
SUPPORT CATEGORY FOUR STRENGTH.  THE PROXIMITY TO THE LANDMASS OF
HONDURAS...CUTTING OFF THE LOW-LEVEL INFLOW FROM THE SOUTH...HAS
PROBABLY BEEN THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE WEAKENING.  VERTICAL SHEAR
APPEARS TO BE LIGHT OVER THE AREA AND IF THE CORE OF THE HURRICANE
REMAINS OVER WATER AS FORECAST MITCH WILL LIKELY REMAIN A FORMIDABLE
HURRICANE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS.

THE EYE HAS EXHIBITED LITTLE OVERALL MOVEMENT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
HOURS.  THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS HAVE BEEN VERY INCONSISTENT WITH
THIS SYSTEM.  FOR EXAMPLE...THE GFDL MODEL HAS VACILLATED FROM RUN
TO RUN AS TO WHETHER MITCH WILL MOVE GENERALLY WESTWARD...OR DRIFT
SLOWLY TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE LATEST SUITE OF OBJECTIVE TRACK
FORECASTS SHOW A MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION DEVELOPING...HOWEVER THE
U.K. MET OFFICE MODEL INDICATES A MAINLY WESTWARD TRACK.  IT
SUFFICES TO SAY THAT THE STEERING FLOW REMAINS ILL-DEFINED.  THE
CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
ONE...HOWEVER INTERESTS IN THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN SHOULD BEAR IN
MIND THAT THESE FORECASTS ARE UNCERTAIN AND THAT THE DANGEROUS
AFFECTS OF THIS HURRICANE COVER A SIZEABLE AREA.  

ALTHOUGH THE STORM SURGE...WAVES...AND HIGH WINDS ARE VERY
DANGEROUS...RAINFALL FROM THIS SLOW-MOVING SYSTEM IS PARTICULARLY
LIFE-THREATENING.  FIFI...A CATEGORY 2 HURRICANE IN 1974 WHICH MOVED

HURRICANE MITCH DISCUSSION NUMBER  27
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST WED OCT 28 1998
 
MITCH HAS BEEN MEANDERING THIS MORNING BETWEEN THE ISLAND OF GUANAJA
AND THE NORTH COAST OF HONDURAS.  THE LATEST FIX FROM THE U.S. AIR
FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT WAS A FEW TENTHS SOUTH OF
OUR 03Z POSITION...WITH SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB
AND SAB IN CLOSE AGREEMENT.  THE HURRICANE MAY BE IN THE PROCESS OF
MAKING A CYCLONIC LOOP.  WITH THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE CURRENT MOTION
MITCH WILL BE HELD STATIONARY WITH A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION EXPECTED
TO BEGIN LATER TODAY.
 
THE EYE HAS CONTINUED TO LOSE DEFINITION IN SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE
LATEST CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED FROM THE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT 
IS 941 MB...UP 8 MB SINCE THE LAST PENETRATION AROUND 00Z. THE RECON
MESSAGE ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE EYE WAS FILLING IN. THUS...THE
WEAKENING TREND HAS CONTINUED.  THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND
REPORTED WAS 120 KNOTS.  HOWEVER...AS WAS THE CASE IN EARLIER
MISSIONS THE DROPWINDSONDE DATA SHOW HIGHER WIND SPEEDS NEAR THE
SURFACE.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS NOW 115 KNOTS...MINIMUM CATEGORY
FOUR STATUS. THE PROXIMITY OF THE HURRICANE TO THE LANDMASS OF
HONDURAS...SERVING TO CUT OFF THE LOW-LEVEL INFLOW FROM THE SOUTH...
HAS PROBABLY BEEN THE PRIMARY CULPRIT BEHIND MITCH/S WEAKENING. WITH
A WEAK VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ENVIRONMENT AND THE ANTICIPATION OF THE
RESUMPTION OF A WESTWARD MOTION...WHICH WOULD BRING THE CORE OF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE BACK OVER WATER...MITCH IS FORECAST TO REMAIN A
FORMIDABLE HURRICANE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
 
THE 00Z GLOBAL MODELS OFFER LITTLE TO HELP RESOLVE THE STEERING
ENVIRONMENT. THE 06Z TRACK MODELS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THEIR 00Z
COUNTERPARTS DISPLAYING CONSIDERABLE SCATTER. THE SOLUTIONS VARY

WHILE MOST OF THE MODELS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE FORECAST
A WESTWARD MOTION AND LANDFALL ON THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...MITCH HAS
MOVED VERY LITTLE...IN FACT LESS THAN 40 NM IN THE PAST 18 HOURS.
THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO CAMPS OF FUTURE TRACKS.  THE FIRST INCLUDES
THE MODEL THAT HAS PERFORMED THE BEST SO FAR...NOGAPS.  THE NOGAPS
HAS PERSISTENTLY INDICATED AN EVENTUAL NORTHWARD MOVEMENT...WHEN ITS
REPRESENTATION OF THE LONGWAVE RIDGE AXIS WELL TO THE NORTHWEST
SHIFTS EASTWARD OF MITCH/S LONGITUDE IN 48 TO 72 HOURS.  THE MOST
RECENT GFDL...LBAR AND BAMD ARE NOW SIMILAR TO NOGAPS.  THE
REMAINING GUIDANCE IS TOWARD THE WNW TO NW.  IN DEFERENCE TO THE
FIRST GROUP...THE OFFICIAL TRACK SHIFTS THE THREE DAY POSITION A
LITTLE TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THIS IS A
SUBTLE BUT POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR THE U.S. GULF COAST--
MITCH WILL CONTINUE BATTERING PORTIONS OF THE NW CARIBBEAN FOR THE
NEXT 3 DAYS...AND COULD POSE A THREAT TO THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION
AFTER THAT.
 
CLOUD TOPS CONTINUE TO SLOWLY WARM...BUT NO CHANGE IS MADE TO THE
CURRENT INTENSITY.  A CONTINUED INTERACTION OF THE CIRCULATION WITH
LAND COULD RESULT IN FURTHER WEAKENING.  PERHAPS UPWELLING WILL LEAD
TO SOME WEAKENING AS WELL.  IF MITCH BEGINS TO MOVE NORTHWARD THEN
THE WEAKENING TREND WOULD LIKELY BE ARRESTED AND EVEN SOME
RE-INTENSIFICATION COULD OCCUR.
 
THE RECON DATA SHOW A PAIR OF WIND MAXIMA IN THE NORTHERN
SEMICIRCLE.  THE RADII FOR 64 KT AND 50 KT HAVE BEEN INCREASED TO
COVER THE OUTERMOST LOCATION OF THESE SPEEDS.
 
VERY DANGEROUS STORM SURGE...WAVES...AND HIGH WINDS WILL CONTINUE
OVER PORTIONS OF HONDURAS AND ADJACENT ISLANDS.  RAINFALL FROM THIS
SLOW-MOVING HURRICANE WILL ALSO BE A MAJOR THREAT...PRODUCING
LIFE-THREATENING FLASH FLOODS AND MUD SLIDES.

MITCH HAS DRIFTED TOWARD THE WEST OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS...
AND THIS RUN OF THE BAM SUGGEST THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE.  ALTHOUGH A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH OR TWO WILL BE PASSING WELL TO THE NORTH OF MITCH
DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO...MUCH OF THE REMAINING 12Z GUIDANCE
AGAIN SUGGESTS THAT NO SIGNIFICANT MOTION WILL OCCUR UNTIL THE
LONGWAVE RIDGE TO THE NW MOVES EAST OF MITCH/S LONGITUDE.  THE
NOGAPS SHOWS THIS OCCURRING IN ABOUT 72 HOURS.  THE GFDL HAS A
SIMILAR BUT DELAYED PATTERN EVOLUTION...WHILE THE AVN IS A LITTLE
SLOWER YET.  AS A RESULT...THE NOGAPS ENDS UP IN 72 HOURS IN THE
YUCATAN CHANNEL WHILE THE AVN IS NEAR THE NW TIP OF THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA.  THE NHC TRACK IS BETWEEN THESE TWO...AND VERY NEAR OUR
PREVIOUS TRACK AND THE CURRENT GFDL.
 
THE WEAKENING TREND HAS CONTINUED WITH THE CENTRAL PRESSURE NOW UP
TO 960 MB.  THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS ESTIMATED AT 100 KT.  THE
HURRICANE HAS LIKELY WEAKENED FROM A COMBINATION OF INTERACTION WITH
LAND...UPWELLED COOLER WATERS...AND A POSSIBLE EYEWALL REPLACEMENT
CYCLE AS INFERRED FROM THE DOUBLE WIND MAXIMA NOTED THIS MORNING. 
FURTHER WEAKENING WILL BE SHOWN UNTIL THE SYSTEM STARTS TO MOVE.

HURRICANE MITCH DISCUSSION NUMBER  30
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 PM EST WED OCT 28 1998

MITCH HAS BEEN STAGNATED NEAR THE BAY ISLANDS AND WILL LIKELY REMAIN
SO THROUGH TONIGHT.  THE CONTINUED INTERACTION OF THE SOUTHERN
PORTION OF ITS CIRCULATION WITH HONDURAS AND UPWELLING OF COOLER
SHELF WATERS NEAR THE COAST HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A STEADY WEAKENING.
LAST AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE OBSERVATIONS SHOWED A BREAKDOWN OF THE
EYEWALL STRUCTURE.  SOME FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY IF THE SYSTEM
REMAINS QUASI-STATIONARY...BUT IF THE CENTER MOVES BACK OVER OPEN
WATERS...RE-STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR.  

VERY LITTLE CHANGE IS MADE TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST. 
NUMERICAL GUIDANCE MODELS CONTINUE TO BE DIVERSE.  THE NOGAPS MODEL
SHOWS A MOSTLY NORTHWARD MOTION DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD...BUT
OTHER MODELS PREDICT A NORTHWESTWARD TO WESTWARD TRACK.  THE LATEST
NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS VERY LITTLE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE
500 MB LONGWAVE RIDGE THAT IS CURRENTLY OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO
DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  HOWEVER THIS MODEL DOES SHOW THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE TO THE EAST OF MITCH
IN 2-3 DAYS.  THIS COULD RESULT IN A MORE NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF
MOTION.  

BEYOND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST PERIOD...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AT 500 MB
MAY BREAK DOWN THE GULF RIDGE AND COULD STEER MITCH TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST...BUT THIS IS UNCERTAIN.    
 
STORM SURGE...WAVES...AND HIGH WINDS WILL CONTINUE OVER PORTIONS OF
HONDURAS AND ADJACENT ISLANDS.  LARGE AND DANGEROUS WAVES ARE ALSO
IMPACTING OTHER COASTAL LOCATIONS IN THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA. 
RAINFALL FROM THIS SLOW-MOVING HURRICANE IS ALSO A MAJOR THREAT...
PRODUCING LIFE-THREATENING FLASH FLOODS AND MUD SLIDES.

THE LATEST CENTER FIX FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT PLACES THE CENTER OF MITCH ON THE CAPE OF HONDURAS.
BASED ON THE LAST 12 HOURS OF RECON FIXES THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN
DRIFTING SOUTHWARD AND MAYBE DOING ANOTHER CYCLONIC LOOP.  MITCH
WILL BE HELD QUASI-STATIONARY INITIALLY...WITH A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST
MOTION FORECAST BY 12 HOURS.
 
RECON DATA SHOWS THAT MITCH HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN WITH THE CENTRAL
PRESSURE NOW UP TO 979 MB...A 41 MB RISE IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.  THE
DROPWINDSONDE DATA SHOWS 74 KNOTS AT 922 MB.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY
WILL BE REDUCED TO 75 KNOTS.  FURTHER WEAKENING IS POSSIBLE IF THE
CIRCULATION REMAINS ON THE COAST OR DRIFTS FARTHER INLAND...BUT IF
THE CENTER MOVES BACK OVER OPEN WATERS AS FORECAST RE-STRENGTHENING
COULD OCCUR.
 
ALTHOUGH THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS CONTINUE TO DISPLAY SOME
SCATTER A FAIR NUMBER HAVE REACHED A CONSENSUS ON A GENERAL
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CLIPER...ALL THE MODELS
BRING MITCH INLAND EITHER OVER BELIZE OR THE YUCATAN PENINSULA.
THE NOGAPS MODEL...WHICH HAD A NORTHWARD HEADING AT 00Z...NOW SHOWS
A MOSTLY NORTHWESTWARD MOTION DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD BRINGING
THE HURRICANE INTO NORTHERN BELIZE AFTER 48 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST IS SLIGHT LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BUT MAINTAINS
THE SLOW FORWARD SPEED. THE 00Z RUNS OF THE NCEP AND NOGAPS GLOBAL
MODELS SHOW A MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH FORMING EAST OF MITCH IN THE
NEXT 48-72 HOURS.  THIS MAY IMPART A MORE NORTHERLY MOTION LATER 
IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT IN INDICATING A SLOW NW MOTION...AS NOTED 6

DAYS. THE OFFICIAL TRACK REFLECTS THIS...BRINGING MITCH TO NEAR THE
EAST COAST OF THE YUCATAN OR BELIZE IN ABOUT TWO DAYS.  THE GFDL IS
THE OUTLIER THIS MORNING...SHOWING LITTLE MOVEMENT FOR ANOTHER 3
DAYS.  THE LONGER TERM TRACK REMAINS EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN WITH THE
00Z NOGAPS AND MRF SHOWING AN EVENTUAL BREAKDOWN OF THE LARGE SCALE
PATTERN TO THE NORTH ALLOWING MITCH TO THEN MOVE TOWARD THE NORTH
AND MAYBE THE NORTHEAST.
 
THE HIGHEST FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS ON THE EARLY MORNING RECON MISSION
WERE 72 KT.  THE PRESSURE WAS THEN UP TO 987 MB.  INITIAL WIND SPEED
IS ESTIMATED AT 65 KT.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MITCH WILL WEAKEN BELOW
HURRICANE STRENGTH LATER TODAY...BUT IF IT BEGINS TO MOVE AS

ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.  ON THE BASIS THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE WILL BE SET AT 255/03 KNOTS.

NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THIS IS LIKELY
IN RESPONSE TO THE AVIATION AND NOGAPS GLOBAL MODELS DEVELOPMENT OF 
A MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE EAST OF THE MITCH.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE THROUGH 12 HOURS
FOLLOWED BY A GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING THEREAFTER.  THIS TRACK IS
SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.   

THE CENTER OF MITCH REMAINS OVER LAND AND THE CIRCULATION CONTINUES

AND IS INLAND OVER HONDURAS.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 240/02.
ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST TO
NORTHWESTWARD DRIFT FOR 72 HOURS.  THIS IS THE RESULT OF A DEEP-

ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECENT SURFACE OBSERVATIONS OVER WATER TO KNOW
WHETHER MITCH IS STILL OF STORM STRENGTH.  AN AIRCRAFT WILL
INVESTIGATE THIS AFTERNOON TO DETERMINE THE WIND SPEEDS.  MEANWHILE
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL LEAVE THE WIND SPEED AT 35 KNOTS FOR 72

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 240/03.  THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS
THE HIGH IN THE GULF OF MEXICO BEING ERODED BY A SHORT WAVE TROUGH
IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS.  THIS IS THE BASIS FOR A SLOW NORTHWARD
COMPONENT OF MOTION SHOWN BY THE GFDL...NOGAPS...AND AVIATION
MODELS.  THE UKMET SHOWS MORE OF A NORTHWESTWARD MOTION.  THE
OFFICAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO...AND AN UPDATE OF...THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
THE CONVECTION IN THE MAIN BANDING FEATURE HAS BEEN DECREASING.
HOWEVER A RECENT REPORT OF 49 KNOTS FROM ROATAN REQUIRES THAT THE
WIND SPEED BE INCREASED BACK UP TO 50 KNOTS.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN
THAT A STRENGTENING TREND IS OCCURRING...BUT IT MEANS THAT OUR
PREVIOUS ESTIMATES WERE TOO LOW??  AN EVEN HIGHER OBSERVATION OF
70 KNOTS FROM PUERTO BARRIOS IS BELIEVED TO BE A RESULT OF A
FUNNELING EFFECT FROM NEARBY MOUNTAINS.  EXCEPT FOR THIS ADJUSTMENT
OF WIND SPEED...MITCH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WEAKENING AS MOST OF
THE CIRCULATION IS FORECAST TO REMAIN OVER LAND.
 
HEAVY RAINFALL OVER HONDURAS...NICARAGUA...GUATEMALA...BELIZE...AND
PORTIONS OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA CONTINUES TO BE THE PRIMARY

10 PM EST FRI OCT 30 1998
 
WHILE THE CIRCULATION CENTER IS DEVOID OF THUNDERSTORMS...MITCH
CONTINUES TO PRODUCE INTENSE CONVECTION PRIMARILY NEAR THE PACIFIC
BORDER AREA OF HONDURAS AND NICARAGUA.  IN THAT AREA...CLOUD TOP
TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS -90C HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY GOES SATELLITE AND
IMPLY THAT TORRENTIAL RAINS CONTINUE.  WINDS REMAIN LOCALLY STRONG
ALONG THE HONDURAS CARIBBEAN COAST...WITH 45-50 KT NOTED EARLIER
THIS EVENING AT ROATAN.

SURFACE DATA AND SATELLITE PICTURES SUGGEST THAT THE SURFACE CENTER
IS NOW OVER CENTRAL HONDURAS AND MOVING TOWARD ABOUT 250 DEGREES
NEAR 6 KT.  WHILE NUMERICAL MODELS HAVE SHOWN AN EVENTUAL BREAKDOWN
IN THE HIGH TO THE NORTH FOR SOME DAYS...THE 18Z AVN NOW INDICATES
THAT CHANGE SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.  IF CORRECT
...AND IF MITCH SURVIVES THAT LONG...THEN MITCH COULD BE PULLED
TOWARD THE NW OR NORTH.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS BASED ON THAT
PROGRESSION AND IS SIMILAR TO THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE.
 
HEAVY RAINFALL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODS ARE LIKELY TO PERSIST
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 24 TO 48 HOURS OVER PORTIONS OF HONDURAS...
NICARAGUA...GUATEMALA...BELIZE...EL SALVADOR...AND THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA.
 
THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY THAT TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS COULD
EVENTUALLY BE REQUIRED FOR THE PACIFIC COAST OF SOME OF THE ABOVE
MENTIONED AREAS.

THE CENTER IS POORLY DEFINED OVER THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF
HONDURAS AND DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON INFRARED IMAGES.  THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS 245/06.  THERER ARE NO IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE
TRACK GUIDANCE.  THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE 500 MB HIGH IN THE
GULF OF MEXICO BEING REPLACE BY WESTERLIES DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS
AND MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A SLOW MOTION FOR 72
HOURS WITH A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND THE GFDL MODEL SHOWING A SLOW
NORTHWARD TURN.
 
MOST OF THE CONVECTION IS GONE FROM OVER THE WATER NORTH OF HONDURAS
AND THE WINDS SPEEDS SHOULD BE DECREASING THERE.  A HUGE AREA OF
DEEP CONVECTION PERSISTS TO THE SOUTH OF THE CENTER AND EXTENDS 
OVER EASTERN PACIFIC WATERS.
 
HEAVY RAINFALL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODS ARE LIKELY TO PERSIST
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 24 TO 48 HOURS OVER PORTIONS OF HONDURAS...
NICARAGUA...GUATEMALA...AND EL SALVADOR.
 
EVEN THOUGH IS IS NOT PART OF THE FORECAST...THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
THAT THE CENTER COULD MOVE OR REFORM OVER PACIFIC WATERS...REQUIRING
TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS FOR THE PACIFIC COAST OF CENTRAL AMERICA.

12Z SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM WESTERN HONDURAS SUGGEST THAT THE
CENTER OF MITCH IS POSITIONED A BIT FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS
THOUGHT...SATELLITE-BASED FIXES ALSO SUPPORT THIS ALTHOUGH THE
CIRCULATION CENTER IS BY NO MEANS WELL-DEFINED.  THERE HAVE NOT
BEEN ANY REPORTS OF 34 KNOT WINDS FOR THE LAST 12 HOURS AND LAND
OBSERVATIONS INDICATE 10-20 KNOT WINDS.  THUS...MITCH IS BEING
DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS NOW 30 KNOTS.  THE GOVERNMENTS OF MEXICO...BELIZE...
GUATEMALA HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND ARE DISCONTINUING THE TROPICAL
STORM WARNINGS FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE COASTLINES.  WE HAVE BEEN
UNABLE TO CONTACT HONDURAS BUT EXPECT THEY WILL CONCUR.
 
BASED ON THE POSITION ESTIMATE THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 270/06
KNOTS. THE NCEP GLOBAL MODELS SHOW THE MID-LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE
GULF OF MEXICO BREAKING DOWN DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS AS A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST U.S. THE NHC TRACK 
CALLS FOR A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 36 HOURS
FOLLOWED BY A MORE NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72 HOURS..IN CLOSEST
AGREEMENT WITH THE UKMET AND THE GFDL GUIDANCE.  THE TRACK HAS THE
SYSTEM MOVING OVER THE MOST MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF GUATEMALA...WITH
PEAKS OF 8000-13000 FT.  THUS...THE SYSTEM MAY NOT SURVIVE AS LONG
AS FORECAST.

MITCH CONTINUES TO UP IN MOISTURE FROM THE EAST PACIFIC HELPING 
FUEL SOME DEEP CONVECTION MAINLY WEST OF THE CENTER.  THE STRONGEST
CONVECTION IS OCCURRING ALONG THE CARIBBEAN COASTAL SECTIONS OF
NICARAGUA...SOUTHERN EL SALVADOR...THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF HONDURAS
...WESTERN NICARAGUA...AND THE ADJACENT EAST PACIFIC WATERS.  HEAVY
RAINFALL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FLASH FLOODS AND MUD SLIDES WILL
LIKELY CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO.

...CORRECTION TO 5TH PARAGRAPH...
 
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT MITCH HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE
WESTWARD AND IS IN THE VICINITY OF THE HONDURAS-GUATEMALA-EL
SALVADOR BORDER.  VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT MITCH
STILL HAS A FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION ALTHOUGH 
MOST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPRESSION IS
OCCURRING WELL SOUTH AND EAST OF THE CENTER.  

SEVERAL 15Z SHIPS OBSERVATIONS FROM THE GULF OF HONDURAS WERE
RECEIVED LATE THIS MORNING SHOWING WINDS OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE
...33 KNOTS FROM SHIP C6YE AND 54 KNOTS FROM C6HH3...WELL REMOVED
FROM THE CIRCULATION CENTER. THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE LIKELY
ASSOCIATED WITH A BAND OF STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WHICH HAS SINCE
WEAKENED.  AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE BELIZE METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE
THEY INFORMED US OF THE FUNNELING EFFECT WHICH OCCURS IN THE GULF 
OF HONDURAS. THUS...THESE WINDS ARE LIKELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A
COMBINATION OF THE CONVECTION AND THE LOCAL FUNNELING EFFECT.  
A *SMALL CRAFT REMAIN IN PORT* STATEMENT HAS BEEN ADDED TO BOTH 
THE PUBLIC AND FORECAST/ADVISORY PRODUCTS TO HIGHLIGHT THIS THREAT
TO MARINE AND COASTAL INTERESTS. THIS STATEMENT ALSO COVERS THE
PACIFIC COASTAL AREAS AS THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED AND WE
HAVE RECEIVED SOME SHIP REPORTS OF 25 TO 30 KNOTS...MAINLY OFFSHORE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 270/10 KNOTS. BOTH THE AVIATION AND NAVY
GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE MID-LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE GULF
OF MEXICO BREAKING DOWN DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS AS A SHORTWAVE
TROUGH MOVES OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ONE OWING TO THE
INITIAL WESTWARD MOTION.  THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY OVER 8000-
10000 FT PEAKS AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK HAS THE SYSTEM MOVING OVER
THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF GUATEMALA. THUS...THE SYSTEM MAY NOT
SURVIVE AS LONG AS FORECAST.

THE OFFICIAL TRACK BRINGS THE SYSTEM CLOSER TO THE PACIFIC COAST OF
MEXICO...AND THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT THE CENTER COULD MOVE
INTO...OR REFORM OVER...PACIFIC WATERS LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

MITCH CONTINUES TO PULL IN MOISTURE FROM THE EAST PACIFIC HELPING
FUEL SOME DEEP CONVECTION MAINLY WEST OF THE CENTER.  THE STRONGEST
CONVECTION IS OCCURRING ALONG THE CARIBBEAN COASTAL SECTIONS OF
NICARAGUA...SOUTHERN EL SALVADOR...THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF HONDURAS
...WESTERN NICARAGUA...AND THE ADJACENT EAST PACIFIC WATERS.  HEAVY
RAINFALL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FLASH FLOODS AND MUD SLIDES WILL
LIKELY CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO.

THE CENTER IS ILL-DEFINED BUT IT APPEARS THAT A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION
HAS CONTINUED SINCE THE LAST ADVISORY.  MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE
SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH IN A DAY OR TWO.  WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS SOUTHERLY TO SOUTHWESTERLY MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL

SHORTWAVE MOVING EAST-NORTHEASTWARD AND THE 500 MB ANTICYCLONE OVER
THE GULF OF MEXICO BREAKING DOWN WITHIN 24-48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AND SHOWS MITCH MOVING INTO
THE GULF OF MEXICO LATER IN THE PERIOD...IF IT SURVIVES.

SINCE THE FORECAST DOES NOT HAVE MITCH MOVING INTO THE EASTERN
PACIFIC...ALTHOUGH THAT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE...IT WILL CONTINUE TO
BE CLASSIFIED AS AN ATLANTIC TROPICAL CYCLONE FOR NOW.

THE CIRCULATION HAS BECOME POORLY-DEFINED AT THE SURFACE...AS IT
CONTINUES TO BE DISRUPTED BY THE MOUNTAINOUS LAND MASS OF GUATEMALA
AND SOUTHEASTERN MEXICO.  MOREOVER...SIGNIFICANT REGENERATION OVER

IN FLYING THROUGH MITCH EARLIER THIS EVENING...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS
PROVIDED CENTER FIXES BUT HAD TO SEARCH AROUND A BIT TO DO SO AS THE
INNER CIRCULATION WAS NOT PARTICULARLY WELL FORMED.  GIVEN THAT THE
SYSTEM IS NOW CENTERED OVER LAND...THE WINDS HAVE LIKELY DECREASED
TO NEAR 35 KT...DESPITE THE BAND OF INTENSE CONVECTION NOTED OVER
THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE.  MITCH COULD BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL
DEPRESSION LATER TONIGHT.
 
MITCH COULD AGAIN RESTRENGTHEN A LITTLE ONCE ITS CENTER LEAVES THE
YUCATAN AND MOVES OVER THE STILL RELATIVELY WARM WATERS OF THE SE
GULF OF MEXICO.  OUTPUT FROM THE 18Z AVN ALSO SUGGESTS THAT MITCH
COULD UNDERGO A MODEST RESTRENGTHENING DUE TO BAROCLINIC PROCESSES
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CYCLONE/S INTERACTION WITH THE APPROACHING
FRONT.  EITHER WAY...MITCH IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A HEAVY RAIN PRODUCER
WITH MUCH OF THE PRECIPITATION TO PRECEDE THE CENTER AND...GIVEN THE
FORECAST MOTION...WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS LIKELY TO BE TO THE SE OF
THE CENTER.
 
THE DYNAMICAL TRACK GUIDANCE TAKES MITCH TOWARD THE NORTHEAST
EITHER ACROSS THE FL PENINSULA OR THE FL STRAITS...EXCEPT THE GFDL
WHICH DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM.  THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF SPEEDS
FORECAST...HOWEVER...WITH 72 HOUR POINTS STRETCHING FROM THE NW
BAHAMAS TO THE AZORES.  THE NHC TRACK REPRESENTS AN INTERMEDIATE
SOLUTION AND IS ESSENTIALLY AN EXTENSION OF OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST.

MOST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH MITCH IS WELL-REMOVED
FROM THE CENTER...WITH ONE AREA OVER THE NORTHEASTERN YUCATAN
EXTENDING SOUTHWARD ALONG THE COAST OF BELIZE AND ANOTHER LARGER
AREA LOCATED OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL/SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. THE
INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE REDUCED TO 30 KT...BRINGING MITCH TO
TROPICAL DEPRESSION STATUS.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
WHICH HAS MITCH RE-STRENGTHENING TO A TROPICAL STORM WITHIN 36 HOURS
AS IT MOVES INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO DUE TO FAVORABLE SST/S
AND INTERACTION WITH AN APPROACHING FRONT. MITCH IS FORECAST TO
BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY 72 HOURS...ALTHOUGH THIS MAY OCCUR SOONER 
AS THE SYSTEM BECOMES ABSORBED BY THE APPROACHING FRONTAL ZONE.
REGARDLESS...THE MAIN THREAT POSED BY MITCH IS LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINFALL MAINLY IN ADVANCE OF THE CENTER.  THE LEADING EDGE OF 
THE RAIN SHIELD IS JUST WEST OF KEY WEST FLORIDA AT THIS TIME. 

INFRARED-BASED SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB PLACE THE POORLY-
DEFINED CENTER OF MITCH OVER THE NORTHWEST YUCATAN PENINSULA ABOUT
MIDWAY BETWEEN MERIDA AND CARMEN MEXICO. HOWEVER...THE LATEST
OBSERVATION FROM MERIDA SHOWS A SSW WIND SUGGESTING THAT THE CENTER

10 AM EST WED NOV 04 1998
 
REPORTS FROM SHIPS AND SURFACE SITES INDICATE THAT MITCH IS NOT
COMPLETELY TROPICAL ANYMORE.  WHILE CONVECTION IS MINIMAL NEAR THE
CENTER AND WINDS WITHIN ABOUT 100 NM OF THE CENTER SEEM TO BE
RELATIVELY LIGHT AT THIS TIME...GALE/TROPICAL STORM FORCE CONDITIONS
ARE OCCURRING IN A CONVECTIVE BAND BETWEEN 200 AND 300 NM SOUTHEAST
TO NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.   TO ACCOMMODATE THIS AND SIMPLIFY THE
WARNING PROCESS REQUIRES UPGRADING MITCH BACK TO A TROPICAL STORM...
WITH 40 KT WINDS.  SOME FILLING IN OF THE WIND FIELD IS LIKELY
DURING THE NEXT DAY.  THE STRUCTURE IS LIKELY TO BE COMPLICATED
FURTHER BY THE INCREASING INTERACTION BETWEEN MITCH AND THE
APPROACHING FRONT.
  
A TROPICAL STORM WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT FOR A PORTION OF THE FL
PENINSULA AND FL KEYS.  NORTHWARD FROM THERE...WINDS ARE ALSO LIKELY
TO INCREASE AND COULD REACH GALE STRENGTH ALONG THE COAST AS MITCH
TRANSITIONS INTO AN EXTRATROPICAL GALE UPON LEAVING FLORIDA.  THIS
IS PREDICATED ON A NORTHEASTWARD FORECAST TRACK WITH INCREASING
FORWARD SPEED...AS IMPLIED BY MOST OF THE NUMERICAL GUIDANCE.

THE PRIMARY IMPACT OF MITCH STILL APPEARS TO BE AREAS OF HEAVY
RAIN...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SEVERE WEATHER...AND LOCALLY GUSTY
WINDS.

HAVE BEEN PUSHED AHEAD A LITTLE TOO FAST ALONG THE TRACK...
HOWEVER...AND THE CURRENT POSITION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LATEST
SHIP OBSERVATIONS.  AS NOTED EARLIER...THE SYSTEM MAY ALREADY HAVE
LOST SOME TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS AND
HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION WELL-REMOVED FROM THE CENTER.  A LITTLE
STRENGTHENING...MAINLY DUE TO BAROCLINIC PROCESSES...COULD OCCUR
DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  MITCH IS LIKELY TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL
BY 48 HOURS OR SOONER.

WITH THE SHEARING ENVIRONMENT...SOME SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AND
ISOLATED TORNADOES MAY OCCUR IN PORTIONS OF THE WARNING AREA DURING
THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO.  AREAS OF HEAVY RAIN WILL CONTINUE
SPREADING OVER THE WARNING AREA THROUGH TONIGHT.  TROPICAL STORM
FORCE WINDS WILL LIKELY OCCUR ONLY IN A FEW OF THE RAINBANDS WELL
EAST OF THE CENTER. 

CURRENT MOVEMENT IS NORTHEAST NEAR 20 KNOTS.  MOST NUMERICAL MODELS

MITCH DOES NOT LOOK VERY TROPICAL...AND IN FACT IF THIS WERE NOT THE
REMNANTS OF MITCH WE WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE CALLING THIS A TROPICAL
CYCLONE.  HOWEVER...TO BEST SERVE THE WARNING PROCESS AND HIGHLIGHT
THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT...WE WILL CONTINUE TO REFER TO THIS SYSTEM
AS A TROPICAL STORM.
 
INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 45 KNOTS BASED ON SHIP REPORTS AND
RECON DATA.  THE STRONGEST WINDS WILL OCCUR IN A FEW OF THE
RAINBANDS WELL EAST OF THE CENTER.  SOME STRENGTHENING...DUE TO
BAROCLINIC PROCESSES...IS POSSIBLE DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  MITCH
WILL LIKELY BE DECLARED EXTRATROPICAL WITHIN 36 HOURS.
 
THE CENTER IS NOT WELL-DEFINED FROM SATELLITE OR RECONNAISSANCE
OBSERVATIONS AND IS ELONGATED ALONG A NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST AXIS.
SOME RELOCATION MAY BE NECESSARY DURING THE NIGHT.  THE CENTER IS
NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE...BUT RATHER THE SEVERE WEATHER
THREAT.  DURING THE EVENING...A TORNADO-PRODUCING MESOCYCLONE WAS
TRACKED WITH THE KEY WEST WSR-88D RADAR OVER THE MIDDLE AND UPPER
FLORIDA KEYS.  WITH THE SHEARING ENVIRONMENT...SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS
AND ISOLATED TORNADOES ARE STILL POSSIBLE OVER PORTIONS OF THE KEYS
AND SOUTHERN/CENTRAL FLORIDA THROUGH THE NIGHT.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NORTHEAST NEAR 23 KNOTS.  MOST NUMERICAL

AS MENTIONED IN EARLIER ADVISORIES MITCH IS NOT VERY TROPICAL IN
APPEARANCE AND ITS TRANSFORMATION TO AN EXTRA-TROPICAL SYSTEM
CONTINUES.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THE BULK OF THE DEEP CONVECTION
EAST OF THE CENTER WITH THE COLDEST CLOUD TOPS...-80 DEG C...MOVING
ONSHORE BETWEEN TAMPA AND NAPLES.   

THE LAST NOAA RECONNAISSANCE PASS THROUGH MITCH REPORTED A CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 993 MB AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS...1500 FT...OF
59 KNOTS.  THE KEY WEST NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR VAD
WIND PROFILE INDICATED 60 KNOTS AT 2000 FT...IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
THE RECON DATA. SINCE THE SYSTEM IS NOT WHOLLY TROPICAL THE USUAL
ADJUSTMENTS TO FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS DOES NOT APPLY.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 45 KNOTS...WITH HIGHER GUSTS POSSIBLE IN
STRONG CONVECTION. SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING...DUE TO BAROCLINIC
PROCESSES...IS SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DURING THE NEXT FEW
DAYS.  MITCH WILL LIKELY BE DECLARED EXTRATROPICAL WITHIN 24 HOURS.

POSITION ESTIMATES FROM THE NOAA RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT SUGGEST
THAT MITCH IS MOVING SLIGHTLY MORE EAST-NORTHEAST AND THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 070/20 KNOTS.  THE CENTER REMAINS ELONGATED
NE-SW AND IS TILTED IN THE VERTICAL...AS EVIDENCED IN THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RADAR AND RECONNAISSANCE FIXES...CONFIRMING
THE ONGOING EXTRA-TROPICAL TRANSITION.  ALL THE DYNAMICAL TRACK
PREDICTION MODELS SHOW A GENERAL EAST-NORTHEAST TO NORTHEAST MOTION 
WITH CONTINUED ACCELERATION THROUGH 48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
REFLECTS THIS...AND REPRESENTS A SLIGHT LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

AS MENTIONED EARLIER...THE CENTER FEATURE IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT
FEATURE RATHER ONE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE...NAMELY
THE CONTINUED HEAVY RAINFALL AND SEVERE WEATHER THREATS.

THE WARNING FOR CUBA WILL LIKELY BE DISCONTINUED LATER THIS MORNING.
THE LOWERING OF TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS FOR FLORIDA WILL BE ADDRESS

HURRICANE HUNTERS HAVE BEEN FLYING SHORE PATROL AROUND THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE PENINSULA.  AT 1118Z THEY REPORTED AN EXTRAPOLATED
PRESSURE OF 988 MB AT THEIR LOCATION JUST WEST OF THE CENTER.  THEY
SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND 73 KT AT THEIR 850 MB FLIGHT LEVEL JUST EAST OF
BISCAYNE BAY.  STRONG CONVECTION IN THE AREA IS LIKELY TRANSPORTING
SOME OF THAT MOMENTUM TOWARD THE SURFACE.  FOWEY ROCKS REPORTED A
10-MIN WIND OF 51 KT.  THEY ALSO HAD A TWO MINUTE WIND OF 52 KT WITH
A GUST TO 63 KT AT THE TOP OF THE 13Z HOUR...WHERE THE AIRCRAFT HAD
ABOUT 65 KT.  HENCE...MITCH RETAINS SOME TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS
AND BASED ON THE OBSERVATIONS THE MAXIMUM WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO
55 KT.

THE CENTER IS NOW EXITING THE FL EAST COAST NEAR JUPITER AND IS
MOVING AT ABOUT 060/23 KT.  A CONTINUED ACCELERATION TOWARD THE NE
IS FORECAST...AS INDICATED BY MODEL GUIDANCE.  THE MODEL TRACKS AND
THE NHC FORECAST PASS NORTH OF BERMUDA IN 24-36 HOURS...BUT ARE

BASED ON DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES...THERE COULD VERY WELL BE WINDS
OF 35 KNOTS OVER A SMALL AREA NEAR THE CENTER.  THIS IS THE BASIS

THE STORM IS LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL PORTION OF A LARGER UPPER-LEVEL
CYCLONE WHERE THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS RELATIVELY WEAK.  THIS IS

MUCH INCREASE IN STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED AND NICOLE IS LIKELY TO
ENCOUNTER LESS FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...AND
WEAKEN.

THE STORM IS MOVING JUST SOUTH OF WEST AND THIS GENERAL MOTION
SHOULD CONTINUE TODAY.  THE MOST REASONABLE STEERING SCENARIO FOR
NICOLE IS A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE WEST AND NORTHWEST DURING THE
PERIOD...AS IT ROUNDS A MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE.  A BROAD

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 250/09...SAME AS LAST ADVISORY.  THE
STORM APPEARS TO BEING STEERED BY THE FLOW BETWEEN AN UPPER LOW AND
A RIDGE TO THE NORTH.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT A SHORT
WAVE APPROACHING FROM THE WEST WILL NOT PICK UP THE STORM AND THAT
IT WILL CONTINUE A MOSTLY WESTWARD MOTION UNTIL THE NEXT SHORT WAVE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BASED ON THIS REASONING AND IS ADJUSTED TO
THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...BUT STILL SHOWS AN INCREASING
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION AFTER 48 HOURS IN RESPONSE TO THE
SECOND SHORT WAVE.  IT IS NOTED THAT MPC GUIDANCE SHOWS THE
ALTERNATE SOLUTION OF THE STORM BEING PICKED UP BY THE FIRST SHORT
WAVE AND THIS WOULD PUT THE 72 HOUR POSITION SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES
NORTHEAST OF THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.
 
UPPER LEVEL WESTERLIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRST SHORT WAVE ARE
WITHIN ABOUT 500 N MI AND ARE EXPECTED TO WEAKEN THE STORM IN ABOUT
24 HOURS.

SHIP REPORTS AT 06Z SHOW THAT THE 24-KNOT WIND SPEED RADII HAVE

10 AM EST WED NOV 25 1998

THE LATEST RUN OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB TROUGH
LIFTING OUT OF THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC AS ANOTHER DIGS NEAR THE U.S.
EAST COAST IN A DAY OR TWO.  THE RESULT OF THIS IS A DISCONTINUOUS
RETROGRESSION WITH A RIDGE DEVELOPING OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC. 
BASED ON THE ABOVE...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED SOUTHWARD...
ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN THE SHALLOW AND MEDIUM-LAYER BAM TRACKS.

HIGH-LEVEL WESTERLY FLOW OVER THE SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE INCREASING
AND NICOLE HAS MORE OF A SHEARED APPEARANCE THAN IT DID YESTERDAY. 
ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS HOMEPAGE SHOW
INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR ALONG THE PROJECTED TRACK.  GRADUAL
WEAKENING OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS FORECAST.

SHEARING CONTINUES TO AFFECT THE STORM AND CENTER IS BECOMING
EXPOSED NEAR THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE DENSE OVERCAST.  DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE NEAR 45 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  FURTHER
WEAKENING IS LIKELY...SINCE STRONG UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC WESTERLIES
SHOULD PERSIST ACROSS THE AREA.

LITTLE CHANGE IS MADE TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST. 
NICOLE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE MOSTLY WESTWARD TO THE SOUTH OF AN
AMPLIFYING MID-LEVEL RIDGE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  IF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE SURVIVES TO THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...A MORE
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION SHOULD DEVELOP AROUND THAT TIME AS THE SYSTEM
NEARS THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS RIDGE.

THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII ARE INCREASED A LITTLE MORE OVER
THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE BASED ON AN 18Z OBSERVATION OF 36 KNOTS FROM
A SHIP...CALL SIGN PJRO...AND SSM/I DATA.

AND 3.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...SUGGESTING THAT WINDS HAVE INCREASED

UNCERTAIN.  HIGH RESOLUTION HIGH LEVEL CLOUD WIND VECTORS DEPICT A
RIDGE OVER NICOLE WHILE WATER VAPOR IMAGES AND 200 MB FORECAST
MODELS INDICATE THAT VERY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLY WINDS SHOULD
REACH THE AREA OF THE STORM SOON.  THIS WOULD SUGGEST RAPID
WEAKENING. ON THE OTHER HAND...BOTH SHIFOR AND THE GFDL BRING NICOLE
TO HURRICANE STATUS.  AT THIS TIME...I DO NOT WANT TO DEVIATE TOO
MUCH FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. THEREFORE...SOME STRENGTHENING IS
INITIALLY INDICATED... FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL WEAKENING. 

NICOLE IS NOW MOVING 290/10.  THERE IS A VERY STRONG COLD FRONT
RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE AND THE BEST ESTIMATE GIVEN
SUCH PATTERN WOULD BE TO FORECAST RECURVATURE.  LATEST GFDL...AVN

10 AM EST SUN NOV 29 1998
 
THE CENTER OF THE STORM REMAINS LOCATED UNDER THE SOUTH-WESTERN EDGE
OF A PERSISTENT MASS OF DEEP CONVECTION.  UPPER-LEVEL DIFFLUENCE
OVER THE AREA APPEARS TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR FOR MAINTAINING
NICOLES INTENSITY AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD
SOON TAKE PLACE SINCE THE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO PERSIST AND THE STORM
IS MOVING OVER COOLER SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES.  NICOLE IS LIKELY TO
LOSE ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN A DAY OR TWO.
 
NICOLE SEEMS TO BE TRACKING ALONG PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK BUT
SLIGHTLY FASTER...050/11 KTS.  TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS VERY SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS GUIDANCE AND CONTINUES TO SHOW A LARGE SPREAD.  THE
UKMET AND NHC98 SHOW CONSIDERABLE ACCELERATION TO THE NORTHEAST. 
THE LBAR...GFDL AND BAMD ARE SLOWER AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS
TWO.  FINALLY...THE BAMS...AVN AND NOGAPS SHOW VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT
AND SLOWLY CURVE THE SYSTEM TO THE SOUTH.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
A COMPROMISE OF THE ABOVE GUIDANCE AND CLOSELY PARALLELS THE GFDL
TRACK AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK BUT SLIGHTLY
FASTER.

SATELLITE PICTURES OVER ABOUT THE PAST 12 HOURS HAVE SHOWN A RAGGED
EYE...SUGGESTING THAT NICOLE HAS PROBABLY BEEN AT THE THRESHOLD OF
HURRICANE STRENGTH FOR PART OF THAT PERIOD.  WITH THAT IN MIND...AND
WITH TAFB DVORAK ANALYSES GIVING NUMBERS OF 3.5 TO 4.0 AT 00Z...
NICOLE WILL BE UPGRADED TO A 65 KT HURRICANE ON THIS ADVISORY. 
CURRENTLY...THE CENTRAL PART OF NICOLE CONSISTS OF A WARM SPOT
EMBEDDED WITHIN A BROKEN RING OF EYEWALL CONVECTION WITH FAIRLY WARM
TOPS.  THE OUTFLOW PATTERN REMAINS DIFFLUENT TO THE EAST WITH MOST
UPPER-LEVEL MOISTURE STREAMING NORTHEASTWARD.
 
INITIAL MOTION USING THE WARM SPOT AS THE CENTER IS 050/13 KT...
SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY ANALYZED.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS
NICOLE CROSSING A NARROW E-W RIDGE AND BEGINNING TO BECOME ENTRAINED
INTO THE WESTERLIES TO THE NORTH.  FLOW AROUND A STRONG TROUGH TO
THE NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED TO CARRY NICOLE TOWARD THE NE...AS
INDICATED BY MOST OF THE GUIDANCE MODEL TRACKS.  BY 36 TO 48 HOURS
...NICOLE SHOULD BE EXTRATROPICAL WHILE PASSING NEAR THE WESTERN

AN EYE IS NO LONGER EVIDENT ON SATELLITE IMAGES...BUT DVORAK
ANALYSES USING THE EMBEDDED CENTER PATTERN SUGGEST THAT THE SYSTEM
IS STILL NEAR HURRICANE STRENGTH.  HOWEVER...THE CLOUD PATTERN IS
BECOMING MORE ASYMMETRIC...WITH MOST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION TO THE
NORTH OF THE CENTER.  GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST AND THE SYSTEM
IS EXPECTED TO MERGE WITH A FRONTAL LOW IN 24 TO 36 HOURS...AS SHOWN
BY THE LATEST AVN RUN OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL.

ALTHOUGH INITIAL MOTION...050/12...IS JUST SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN
BEFORE...MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUE TO SHOW
ACCELERATION WITH STEERING AROUND THE EASTERN SIDE OF A DEEP-LAYER
TROUGH AND CYCLONIC CIRCULATION TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE AZORES.  THE
CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE NCEP
GLOBAL MODEL AND SIMILAR TO THE LATEST GFDL TRACK...THOUGH NOT AS
FAST.  THE FORECAST TRACK SHOWS NICOLE PASSING A LITTLE FARTHER WEST
OF THE AZORES...BUT STILL CLOSE ENOUGH TO POSSIBLY HAVE EFFECTS ON
THOSE ISLANDS IN 24 TO 36 HOURS. 

IT IS OF INTEREST TO NOTE THAT...WITH NICOLE HAVING REACHED
HURRICANE STRENGTH...THE TOTAL OF 33 HURRICANES DURING THE FOUR-

VISIBLE PICTURES HINT AT A POSSIBLE EYE FEATURE RE-EMERGING WITH
A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION JUST NORTH OF THE CENTER.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 65 KNOTS WITH GRADUAL WEAKENING FORECAST  
PER THE LAST PACKAGE.  THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BECOME
EXTRATROPICAL BY 36 HOURS AS IT MERGES WITH A FRONTAL ZONE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 055/12 KNOTS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AS THE TRACK PREDICTION
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE SYSTEM GRADUALLY ACCELERATING AS IT
ROUNDS THE EASTERN SIDE OF A DEEP-LAYER TROUGH AND CYCLONIC
CIRCULATION TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE AZORES. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH BAMD.

THE NHC TRACK FORECAST BRINGS NICOLE SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO THE AZORES

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE LAST
SEVERAL DAYS HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED. FIRST LIGHT
VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE CENTER...ALTHOUGH STILL NOT WELL-
DEFINED...IS NOW SUFFICIENTLY INVOLVED WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION TO
WARRANT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO DEPRESSION STATUS. THE VERTICAL
SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM IS FAIRLY LIGHT ALTHOUGH THE OUTFLOW IS
INHIBITED OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE. THE FORECAST INTENSIFICATION
WILL LIKELY BE LIMITED BY COOLER SST LATER IN THE PERIOD.
 
SATELLITE-BASED CENTER FIXES OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS SHOW
CONSIDERABLE SCATTER. BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS
295/12. THE TRACK FORECAST IS COMPLICATED BY THE AVIATION MODEL
INITIALIZATION OF A SPURIOUS VORTEX TO THE EAST OF THE DEPRESSION.
THIS VORTEX MAY BE PRODUCING A LEFTWARD BIAS IN THE MODEL
FORECASTS...MOST OF WHICH RELY ON THE AVIATION MODEL FIELDS IN
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. MEANWHILE NOGAPS SEEMS TO HAVE A MORE REALISTIC
INITIALIZATION AND SHOWS A MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION. THIS APPEARS
MORE REASONABLE GIVEN THE LARGE MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH
TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE SEEN IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE OPTIONS
AND LEANS TOWARD THE NOGAPS SOLUTION.

ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPRESSION IS VERY BROAD AND POORLY DEFINED. 
LETS FACE IT...THE CENTER CAN BE LOCATED ANYWHERE WITHIN A RADIUS OF
100 N MI. THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS BECOME ELONGATED AND THE CONVECTION
IS SHAPELESS MEANING THAT THE TROPICAL CYCLONE CONTINUES
DISORGANIZED.  SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL HAS ONLY A MODEST
STRENGTHENING...THE GFDL PRACTICALLY DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM BY 72
HOURS OR SO.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS IN BETWEEN AND
CALLS FOR 50 KNOT WINDS...BEFORE THE SYSTEM REACHES COOLER WATERS.
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN INDICATED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 

THE DEPRESSION APPEARS TO BE DRIFTING AIMLESSLY...POSSIBLY DUE TO
THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL POSITION.  MOST OF THE MODELS SUGGEST
THAT A RIDGE WILL BUILD TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE AS THE
CURRENT MID-TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE SYSTEM

STATISTICAL MODELS MOVE THE SYSTEM WESTWARD.  IF WARNINGS HAD TO BE
ISSUED UNDER THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TRACK MODELS...IT WOULD
REQUIRE TO ISSUE THEM FOR A RATHER LARGE AREA.  

SINCE GLOBAL MODELS ARE BUILDING A STRONG MID-LEVEL RIDGE FROM THE
GULF OF MEXICO ACROSS BAJA CALIFORNIA AND WESTWARD...A CONTINUED
MOTION TOWARD THE WEST OR WEST NORTHWEST IS REASONABLE AS SUGGESTED
BY CLIMATOLOGY AND BAM MODELS.

LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT DEEP CONVECTION REMAINS
NEAR THE CIRCULATION CENTER AND BANDING FEATURES ARE INCREASING.   
T-NUMBERS RANGE FROM 2.5 AT SAB AND GLOBAL TO 3.0 AT TAFB.  ALSO THE
OUTFLOW PATTERN HAS IMPROVED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE SYSTEM IN THE
PAST 24-HOURS. THEREFORE THE SYSTEM IS BEING UPGRADED TO TROPICAL
STORM AGATHA...THE FIRST EASTERN PACIFIC STORM OF THE 1998 SEASON.
THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO REMAIN A TROPICAL STORM UNTIL IT MOVES
OVER COOLER WATERS WITHIN THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS. 
 
TRACK MODELS REMAIN IN DISAGREEMENT.  HOWEVER...THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE
FORECAST BY GLOBAL MODELS TO BUILD TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE SYSTEM
APPEARS CORRECT.  THUS...THE OFFICIAL TRACK CONTINUES TOWARD THE
WEST-NORTHWEST.

ON THIS ACCELERATION. SATELLITE-BASED FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE

TO INSIST ON A SOUTHWEST MOTION BY 24 HOURS. THE REMAINDER OF THE
GUIDANCE SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWEST MOTION...AND IS THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST REFLECTS THIS. THE PRIMARY DISCREPANCY IS WITH THE FORWARD
SPEED. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A GRADUAL DECELERATION AS
THE MEAN STEERING DIMINISHES...IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH LBAR. THE

SATELLITE-BASED DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE

WARM SPOT IN SATELLITE IMAGERY DURING THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS THE SYSTEM AT 55 KNOTS THROUGH 24 HOURS 
THEN GRADUALLY WEAKENS IT AS IT MOVES INTO COOLER WATERS.

8 PM PDT SAT JUN 13 1998

AGATHA HAS A WELL DEFINED CURVED CLOUD BAND THAT WRAPS AROUND THE
CENTER...BUT DEEP CONVECTION IS LIMITED.  T-NUMBERS FROM ALL
AGENCIES ARE BETWEEN 3.0 AND 3.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE. THEREFORE...
THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 55 KNOTS.  AGATHA IS ABOUT TO CROSS
THE 26 DEGREE ISOTHERM AND IS HEADING FOR COOLER WATERS. SO...
WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN SOON. 

MODELS ARE BUILDING SUCH A STRONG RIDGE NORTH OF AGATHA THAT THE
STORM IS BEING FORECAST...BY SOME MODELS... TO MOVE SOUTHWARD AND
EVEN SOUTHEASTWARD. THE UK MODEL HAS NOW JOINED THE GFDL AND THE AVN
IN THIS VENTURE. BAM MODELS ARE DECREASING THE FORWARD SPEED OF THE
STORM AND THEN TURN IT EASTWARD WHILE NOGAPS AND STATISTICAL MODELS
ARE MOVING AGATHA WESTWARD.  THIS WOULD MAKE SENSE IF THE STORM
WEAKENS FAST AND THE TRACKING ALGORITHM GATHERS SOME OTHER SPURIOUS
VORTICES NOT RELATED TO AGATHA. I HARD TO ACCEPT THAT...IN THIS
CASE...GLOBAL MODELS AND THE GFDL WOULD BE SO WRONG.   

AT THIS TIME...WITH SUCH A DISCREPANCY...I WOULD GO WITH GOOD OLD
CLIMATOLOGY AND PERSISTENCE...AND MOVE AGATHA ON A GENERAL WEST
NORTHWEST TRACK WITH A DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED WHICH IS NOW ABOUT
17 KNOTS. OBVIOUSLY..IF THE STORM MOVES SOUTHWARD...AS SUGGESTED BY
SOME MODELS...THE SST ARGUMENT IS NOT VALID AND THE STORM WILL
PROBABLY SURVIVE LONGER.

IN SPITE OF BEING OVER SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ESTIMATED AROUND 23
DEGREES CELSIUS...THE STORM HAS MAINTAINED SOME DEEP CONVECTION
AROUND ITS CENTER.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 45 KNOTS FOLLOWING
DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM TAFB MIAMI AND SAB WASHINGTON.  SOUTHWESTERLY
VERTICAL SHEAR IS FORECAST TO INCREASE OVER AGATHA AND COOLER WATERS
SHOULD EVENTUALLY TAKE THEIR TOLL ON THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. 
WEAKENING TO A DEPRESSION IS FORECAST WITHIN 24 HOURS OR SO.  THE
SYSTEM SHOULD BE DISSIPATING LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

AGATHA IS NEARING THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE
AND IS CURRENTLY MOVING NORTHWESTWARD AROUND 9 KNOTS.  SOME FURTHER
SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED IS EXPECTED.  IF THIS WERE A STRONGER
SYSTEM...AGATHA WOULD PROBABLY BEGIN TO RECURVE AROUND THE RIDGE AND
BE STEERED NORTHWARD AND NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD DUE TO A MID- TO UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH OR CYCLONIC SHEAR AXIS EXTEND SOUTHWESTWARD FROM
NORTHERN BAJA.  AGATHA IS A RATHER WEAK STORM HOWEVER...AND ITS
MOTION IS MORE LIKELY TO BE CONTROLLED BY SHALLOWER-LAYER
STEERING...I.E. THE TRADEWINDS.  OUR TRACK MODELS CONTINUE TO BE
HIGHLY DIVERGENT...AND AT THIS TIME THE MOST PRUDENT FORECAST SEEMS
TO BE A MAINTENANCE OF A SLOW NORTHWEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION.

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THAT HAS BEEN MOVING SOUTH OF THE          
CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICAN COASTS DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS     
BECOME A LITTLE BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY.  LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE   
PICTURES SHOW A LARGE CIRCULATION WITH SOME BANDING FEATURES.       
THEREFORE...THE SYSTEM IS BEING CLASSIFIED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.

THE CENTER APPEARS TO BE ELONGATED AND STILL IS IN FORMATIVE STAGE  
SO ADJUSTMENTS IN THE INITIAL POSITION MAY BE REQUIRED LATER.       
                                                                    
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS 30 KT...IN AGREEMENT WITH TAFB DVORAK      
CLASSIFICATIONS.  THE OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED SINCE THE SYSTEM IS     
UNDER EASTERLY SHEAR BUT LIGHT ENOUGH TO ALLOW A GRADUAL            
STRENGTHENING.  THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM IN 18 HOURS AND SHIPS
BEGINS TO WEAKEN IT BY 48 HOURS BASICALLY DUE TO COOL SST.          
HOWEVER..SHIPS IS BASED ON LBAR TRACK FORECAST WHICH HAS A NORTHWARD
BIAS.                                                               
                                                                    
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/15. GLOBAL MODELS        
MAINTAIN A 500 MB RIDGE FROM MEXICO WESTWARD ANN THIS PATTERN WILL  
KEEP THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ON THE SAME GENERAL WET NORTHWEST TRACK

ANIMATION OF SATELLITE PICTURES AGAIN SHOWS A LARGE CIRCULATION
ELONGATED FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST.  THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION
CENTER IS LOCATED NEAR A CONVECTIVE CLUSTER IN THE NORTHEAST PART OF
THE ELONGATION BASED ON TAFB AND SAB ANALYSES.  INITIAL MOTION IS
ESTIMATED AT 290/15 KT.  CLOUD TOPS ARE WARMING AT THE MOMENT WHILE
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES SUPPORT KEEPING THE SYSTEM AS A
DEPRESSION IN THIS ADVISORY.
 
THE AVN MODEL MAINTAINS A STRONG AND LARGE ANTICYCLONE OVER
NORTH-CENTRAL MEXICO AND THE SOUTH-CENTRAL UNITED STATES THROUGH THE
72 HOUR FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS PATTERN IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE MOVING GENERALLY TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST WITH
LITTLE CHANGE IN FORWARD SPEED.  THE TRACK MODELS AND OFFICIAL
FORECAST ALSO SHOW THAT OUTCOME.   THE GFDL SHOWS DISSIPATION WITHIN
24 HOURS...WHILE THE UKMET SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING SOMETHING ELSE THAT
IT HAS MODELED ABOUT 5 DEGREES TO THE SOUTH. 
 
SOME EASTERLY UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE PRESENT WITH AN OTHERWISE
PROMINENT OUTFLOW.  ON THE FORECAST TRACK...THE SYSTEM HAS ONLY 
ANOTHER DAY OR SO TO BECOME MORE CONSOLIDATED AND STRENGTHEN PRIOR
TO REACHING THE SHARP GRADIENT AND A NEGATIVE ANOMALY IN SSTS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT SAT JUN 20 1998
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/16.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS
SHOW A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD MOTION FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS UNDER
THE INFLUENCE OF A RIDGE TO THE NORTH.  THE BAM AND GFDL MODELS SHOW
A SLIGHT SOUTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.  BUT THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL
UNREALISTICALLY INITIALIZES A TROPICAL STORM NEAR 08N 92W AND
INTENSIFIES IT TO A HURRICANE IN 24 TO 36 HOURS AND THIS COULD CAUSE
THE SOUTHWARD MOTION OF THE DEPRESSION.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY MOVING THE SYSTEM
WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD WITH SOME DECELERATION.

THERE HAS BEEN A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR WHERE THE CENTER IS
ASSUMED TO BE LOCATED DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THE LAST COUPLE OF
IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THE BURST HAS PEAKED.  DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE NEAR STORM STRENGTH WITH A 2.5 T NUMBER FROM TAFB AND
2.0 FROM SAB AND KGWC.  THE SYSTEM IS KEPT AT DEPRESSION STRENGTH
FOR THIS ADVISORY AND FORECAST TO A STORM IN 12 HOURS.  THE FORECAST
TRACK BRINGS THE CENTER OVER SSTS BELOW 23 DEGREES C IN 72 HOURS
WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REVERSE THE FORECAST OF SLOW STRENGTHENING
DURNING THE FIRST DAY OR TWO.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT SAT JUN 20 1998

THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS AND THE MAIN FEATURE IS A CLUSTER OF DEEP CONVECTION JUST EAST
OF THE CENTER.  THE DEPRESSION MAY BE VERY CLOSE TO BE A STORM.
HOWEVER...SINCE CONVECTIVE TOPS ARE WARMING AND THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER
IS POORLY DEFINED...WE WILL KEEP THE SYSTEM AS A DEPRESSION IN THIS
ADVISORY.  VISIBLE PICTURES LATER TODAY MAY INDICATE IF THE SYSTEM
HAS BECOME A TROPICAL STORM.  THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO
CROSS THE SHARP GRADIENT OF SST IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS SO
STRENGTHENING...IF OCCURS...HAS TO BE SOON.  BOTH GFDL AND SHIPS
WEAKEN THE SYSTEM BEYOND 36 TO 48 HOURS AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.

THE INITIAL MOTION CONTINUES TO BE 290/16 AND NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
IS EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO. THEREAFTER...A TURN MORE TO
THE WEST IS LIKELY AS THE SYSTEM WEAKENS AND BECOME STEERED BY THE
LOW LEVEL FLOW. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES AS WELL AS NRL MONTEREY ARRAY OF SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOW THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER OF THE DEPRESSION IS
PARTIALLY EXPOSED AND IS LOCATED TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE MAIN
CONVECTION. THIS WAS CAUSED PRIMARILY BY PREVAILING NORTHEASTERLY
WIND SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM.  THE INITIAL POSITION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED
A LITTLE TO THE EAST NORTHEAST OF THE LOCATION GIVEN IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY. THE SYSTEM MAY BE VERY NEAR TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS
BUT... SINCE THE CONVECTION IS CURRENTLY WEAKENING AND THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE IS HEADING FOR COOLER WATERS...IT IS BEING KEPT AS A
DEPRESSION IN THIS ADVISORY.  HOWEVER...A CONVECTIVE BURST COULD
BRING THE SYSTEM TO STORM STATUS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 HOURS BEFORE
WEAKENING OVER COOL WATER BEGINS. BOTH GFDL AND SHIPS DISSIPATE THE
DEPRESSION BY 48 HOURS OR SO.
 
THE DEPRESSION HAS SLOWED DOWN AND IS NOW MOVING 290/11.  A GRADUAL

OF DEEP CONVECTION OVER AND JUST WEST OF THE CIRCULATION CENTER.
THE SYSTEM IS KEPT AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION BASED ON ANALYSES OF
SATELLITE PICTURES.  SOME GROUND TRUTH ON THE INTENSITY COULD COME
FROM SOCORRO ISLAND WHICH WILL BE NEAR THE CYCLONE CENTER DURING THE

PERSISTS...NOW TOWARD 295/10 KT.
 
A MODEST LEFTWARD BEND IN THE TRACK COULD OCCUR OVER THE NEXT DAY OR

ANTICYCLONE THAT LAYS AHEAD OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE...AND THE
INCREASING INFLUENCE OF LOW-LEVEL STEERING WHILE THE DEPRESSION
WEAKENS OVER COOLER WATERS.  THE TRACK MODELS AND OFFICIAL FORECAST

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THAT WAS CENTERED ABOUT 500 MILES SOUTH OF
THE GULF OF TEHUANTEPEC FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS HAS BECOME BETTER
ORGANIZED DURING THE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING HOURS. LATEST INFRARED
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 2.0 AND 2.5 FROM SAB AND TAFB
RESPECTIVELY.  ALSO...LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW A WELL
FORMED CIRCULATION WITH THE CENTER EMBEDDED IN THE DEEP CONVECTION.
THEREFORE...THE SYSTEM IS BEING CLASSIFIED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION
WITH MAXIMUM WINDS OF 30 KTS.
 
THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER THAT WAS BEING SHEARED BY NORTHEAST
UPPER LEVEL WINDS YESTERDAY MOVED RAPIDLY TOWARD THE NORTHWEST
DURING THE EVENING AND NOW THE NORTHEAST WINDS ARE CREATING GOOD
OUTFLOW IN THE SOUTHERN QUADRANT. OUTFLOW IN THE NORTHERN QUADRANT
IS ALSO FAVORABLE.  SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE FORECASTS THE SYSTEM TO
A HURRICANE IN 48 HRS BECAUSE OF LOW VALUES OF FORECASTED VERTICAL
SHEAR AND VERY WARM SST ALONG THE FORECASTED TRACK.  THEREFORE...THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS FOR THIS DEPRESSION TO BE NAMED IN
THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO AND A HURRICANE IN APPROXIMATELY TWO DAYS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/09.  ALL TRACK MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN
THE DIRECTION OF MOTION BUT DIFFER IN FORWARD SPEED AT THE LATER
FORECAST PERIODS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE DIRECTION OF THE
FORECASTS BUT IS A COMPROMISE IN THE DIFFERENT SPEEDS.

TROPICAL STORM BLAS DISCUSSION NUMBER   2
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT MON JUN 22 1998

TROPICAL DEPRESSION THREE-E IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM BLAS.
 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE BOTH 3.0 FROM SAB AND TAFB.
THE SYSTEM IS ON A MODERATE INTENSIFICATION TREND. VISIBLE PICTURE
ANIMATION SHOWS GOOD UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW IN ALL QUADS EXCEPT THE
NORTHEAST WHERE IT IS EITHER NEUTRAL OR SLIGHTLY INWARD.  THE SYSTEM
IS LOCATED OVER SOME OF THE WARMEST WATERS IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC SO
THAT THE SUPPLY OF LATENT AND SENSIBLE HEAT IS NOT A PROBLEM.
THEREFORE...THE SYSTEM IS BEING UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM
WITH MAXIMUM WINDS OF 45 KTS.  INTENSIFICATION TO A HURRICANE IS
FORECAST IN 24 HOURS OR SO.
  
INITIAL MOTION IS 310/13.  ALL TRACK MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN
THE DIRECTION OF MOTION BUT DIFFER IN FORWARD SPEED. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST FOLLOWS THE DIRECTION OF THE MODEL FORECASTS BUT IS A
COMPROMISE IN THE DIFFERENT SPEEDS.

...CORRECTION FOR STORM NAME....

SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS SHOWS A BURST OF DEEP
CONVECTION...TOPS NEAR -80C...OCCURRING OVER THE ESTIMATED CENTER OF
BLAS. THE OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE IS WELL-DEFINED WHILE
IMPROVING OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE. DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE 3.0 AND 3.5 FROM TAFB AND SAB RESPECTIVELY. THEREFORE
THE INITIAL INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY IS SET AT 50 KNOTS. THE
FORECAST BRINGS BLAS TO HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 24 HOURS. BOTH GFDL
AND SHIPS SUPPORT THIS SCENARIO WITH SHIPS SUGGESTING THE WARM SST
AS THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.        
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 305/11. THIS REPRESENTS A SLIGHT
DECELERATION FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...LIKELY IN RESPONSE TO A
MID- TO UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. ALTHOUGH MOST OF
THE TRACK MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN WITH A GENERAL NORTHWEST
MOTION THEY DIVERGE CONSIDERABLY WITH REGARDS TO THE SPEED. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS FASTER THAN CLIPPER AND NHC90 WHILE
SLOWER THAN THE MID AND DEEP BAMS AND LBAR. IT CLOSELY RESEMBLES
THE GFDL. NOGAPS IS THE ONLY MODEL WHICH BRINGS BLAS MORE NORTHWARD
TOWARDS THE COAST OF MEXICO.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/09.  THIS IS A PAST 24 HOUR
MOTION.  THE STORM HAS SLOWED IN FORWARD SPEED AND THE MOTION OVER
THE PAST 12 HOURS MAY BE AS SLOW AS 6 KNOTS.  ALL OF THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR 72 HOURS. 
THIS IS BASED ON A RIDGE HOLDING TO THE NORTH OF THE STORM AS
INDICATED ON THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL RUN.  MOST OF THE MODELS
MAINTAIN ABOUT A 10 KNOT SPEED EXCEPT THE UKMET WHICH IS MUCH SLOWER
AND LBAR WHICH IS SOMEWHAT FASTER.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS IN THE
MIDDLE AND NEAR THE GFDL AND NOGAPS MODELS.

A COLD CDO IS PERSISTING OVER THE CENTER OF THE STORM.  INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB ARE DVORAK T NUMBER 3.5 OR 55 KNOTS
WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR INCREASING THE CURRENT WIND SPEED TO THIS
VALUE.  THE FORECAST IS FOR CONTINUED STRENGTHENING TO 85 KNOTS IN
36 HOURS...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE SHIPS MODEL AND
SHIFOR BRING BLAS TO 90 KNOTS IN 36 HOURS WHILE THE GFLD STAYS BELOW
70 KNOTS.

BLAS CONTINUES TO GRADUALLY BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED WITH A WELL-
DEFINED AND STRONG BANDING FEATURE IN THE SHAPE OF THE NUMBER
6.  IT COULD MAKE IT TO HURRICANE INTENSITY LATER TODAY...BUT DVORAK
SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS DO NOT YET SUPPORT INCREASING THE WIND
SPEED ABOVE 55 KT.  THE ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS HAS LED TO SOME
JUMPING AROUND OF THE ESTIMATED SATELLITE-DERIVED POSITION
ESTIMATES.  INITIAL MOTION IS CURRENTLY NEAR 300/11 KT.
 
THE 00Z MRF OUTPUT SUGGESTS THAT THE LARGE WSW-ENE ORIENTED
ANTICYCLONE OVER NORTHERN MEXICO WILL REMAIN IN PLACE DESPITE THE
FORECAST PROGRESSION OF SEVERAL TROUGHS INTO THE U.S. WEST COAST.
HENCE...LITTLE CHANGE IN TRACK HEADING OR SPEED IS SHOWN IN THE NHC
FORECAST FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH TRACK
MODELS AS WELL...EXCEPT FOR A MUCH SLOWER SPEED INDICATED BY THE
UKMET...AND THE 06Z GFDL RUN WHICH ENDS UP A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES
NORTH OF MOST OF THE OTHER GUIDANCE...AND ITS 00Z FORECAST.
 
THE PATTERN ALSO CONTAINS A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL LOW SEEN IN WV IMAGERY
OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO.  THIS FEATURE APPEARS TO BE
CONTRIBUTING TO THE OUTFLOW ALOFT FROM THE CYCLONE.  WITH WARM
WATERS AHEAD AND THIS ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT...INTENSIFICATION IS
FORECAST THROUGH 48 HOURS.  SOMEWHAT COOLER THAN NORMAL WATERS COULD
AFFECT BLAS THEREAFTER.

2 PM PDT TUE JUN 23 1998
 
SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW AN IMPRESSIVE PRIMARY RAINBAND WRAPPED
AROUND A SMALL CENTRAL CONVECTIVE BALL...WITH HINTS OF A BANDING-
TYPE EYE.  TAFB DVORAK CLASSIFICATION HAS REACHED 4.0 AND SUPPORTS
UPGRADING BLAS TO BE THE FIRST HURRICANE OF THE YEAR IN THE EASTERN
NORTH PACIFIC.  FORWARD SPEED HAS INCREASED TO 13 KT...STILL TOWARD
THE WNW.
 
THE 06Z AVN RUN MAINTAINS THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH THROUGH WEST
OF BLAS WHICH IMPLIES A GENERAL CONTINUATION OF ITS CURRENT MOTION
...AS INDICATED BY NEARLY ALL TRACK MODELS.  THIS TRACK IS ROUGHLY
PARALLEL TO...AND ABOUT 300 MILES OFFSHORE OF...THE COAST.  

A TROUGH THAT MOVES ONSHORE CALIFORNIA IN ABOUT 72 HOURS DOES WEAKEN
THE HIGH A LITTLE...LEAVING AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE THAT BLAS COULD
EVENTUALLY HAVE SOME IMPACT ON FAR SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA.  THE
GFDL TRACK SUGGESTS THIS...BUT IT IS AN OUTLIER FROM THE OTHER
GUIDANCE AND GFDL METEOROLOGISTS INDICATE THAT THE GFDL MODEL MAY
HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A LESS THAN OPTIMAL AVN
INITIALIZATION.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST AGAIN CALLS FOR INTENSIFICATION DURING THE
NEXT DAY OR TWO...BEFORE BLAS REACHES SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER WATERS.

BLAS HAS INTENSIFIED CONSIDERABLY THIS EVENING.  AN EYE HAS RECENTLY
APPEARED IN SATELLITE IMAGERY AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED
TO 90 KNOTS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST DVORAK ESTIMATE FROM TAFB.
WITH THE OUTFLOW AROUND BLAS WELL-ESTABLISHED AND WARM SST/S...
CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 24 HOURS.
WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS IT ENCOUNTERS COOLER WATERS ONLY TOWARD THE
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
THE SYSTEM REMAINS ON A WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING WITH THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE OF 290/14 KNOTS. THE MID-TO UPPER LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC
ANTICYCLONE POSITIONED OVER NORTHWESTERN MEXICO..PER LATEST WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY... SHOULD KEEP BLAS ON THIS GENERAL COURSE THROUGH
72 HOURS. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE GLOBAL SPECTRAL MODEL 500 MB
ENSEMBLE DATA. THE SHORT-WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER THE WESTERN U.S.
COULD WEAKEN THE RIDGE ENOUGH TO SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED LATER IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH

SUBJECTIVE DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB MIAMI AND SAB WASHINGTON
YIELDED A SIMILAR RANGE FOR THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE.  MAXIMUM
WINDS ARE KEPT AT 100 KNOTS...BUT THERE IS STILL SOME POTENTIAL FOR
STRENGTHENING SINCE THE UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN CONTINUES TO
LOOK IMPRESSIVE AND THE SEA SURFACE IS STILL FAIRLY WARM.  HOWEVER
WITHIN A DAY OR SO...WEAKENING IS LIKELY TO COMMENCE AS WATER
TEMPERATURES BECOME MARGINAL.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS IN

HOURS.  IN FACT...IT HAS DISAPPEARED IN THE LATEST INFRARED
SATELLITE IMAGES.  THUS...THE ANTICIPATED WEAKENING TREND HAS
BEGUN.  THIS IS SUPPORTED BY OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE DVORAK
T NUMBERS TRENDS.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 115 KNOTS
FOR THIS ADVISORY WITH GRADUAL WEAKENING THROUGH 72 HOURS...
CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED
TO BE BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 48 HOURS AS IT APPROACHES
22C WATERS.  THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS98
INTENSITY FORECAST MODELS.  HOWEVER...THE WEAKENING MAY BE
MORE RAPID IF BLAS MOVES AT A FASTER PACE.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE NOW OF 305/09 KNOTS.  THE DEEP-LAYER
MEAN RIDGE EXTENDING FROM NORTHERN MEXICO INTO THE PACIFIC SHOULD
KEEP BLAS ON A GENERAL NORTHWEST COURSE THROUGH 48 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO DECELERATE AND TAKE A MORE
NORTHERLY HEADING AS IT APPROACHES THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE
RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL
AND SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN THE BAM MODELS.

AND...EVEN THOUGH ITS TRACK IS NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE SST

THAT IT HAS BEEN SO SLOW TO WEAKEN...IN SPITE OF RELATIVELY COOL

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW JUST SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST AT 10

THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT SOUTH OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.  IT SHOULD BE
NOTED HOWEVER THAT...IN GENERAL...SEVERAL OF THE DYNAMICALLY-BASED

A 45-KNOT OBSERVATION FROM SHIP KGTI AND SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE
THAT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING OFF THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF
MEXICO DURING THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND
HAS REACHED TROPICAL STORM STATUS.  THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER OF CELIA
CAN NOW BE OBSERVED BY THE CUYUTLAN RADAR IN MEXICO.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS SET AT 40 KNOTS.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST FOR
THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO BEFORE THE SYSTEM ENCOUNTERS COOLER SST/S.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/14 KNOTS.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST
TO REMAIN NORTH OF THE SYSTEM SO THIS GENERAL TRACK IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH A GRADUAL DECREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS...
INCLUDING CLIMATOLOGY.   

RADAR AND SATELLITE SHOW THAT THERE ARE BANDS OF HEAVY SHOWERS
APPROACHING THE COAST OF MEXICO WEST OF ZIHUATANEJO.  THIS ACTIVITY
WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE AREA THROUGH THE DAY...PRODUCING HEAVY

THE CENTER OF CELIA CAN BE OBSERVED FROM LOS CABOS RADAR IN MEXICO
AND IT IS ALSO DEPICTED IN THE LAST AVAILABLE SSM/I IMAGE. IT
APPEARS THAT THE STORM IS JUST PASSING ABOUT 120 N MI TO THE SOUTH
OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA WHILE MOVING NEARLY 305/15.
IF THIS TRACK CONTINUES...AS EXPECTED...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS WILL
PROBABLY BE DISCONTINUED LATER THIS MORNING.

THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN INTENSITY AS INDICATED BY T-
NUMBERS.  THE CENTER OF THE STORM APPEARS TO BE EMBEDDED WITHIN A
SMALL BUT CONCENTRATED AREA OF VERY DEEP CONVECTION AT THIS TIME. 
HOWEVER...IN ABOUT 12 HOURS OR LESS...CELIA WILL BE MOVING OVER COOL
WATERS SO A GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN.  GFDL MODEL ALSO WEAKENS
CELIA. 

THE STORM IS MOVING AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A DEEP LAYER MEAN HIGH
PRESSURE SYSTEM LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES. GLOBAL
MODELS INDICATE THAT THE HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD WESTWARD.
CONSEQUENTLY...MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS FORECAST A GENERAL NORTHWEST
TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. SINCE
CELIA IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN...IT WILL PROBABLY BE STEERED MORE TO
THE WEST BY THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW AS SUGGESTED BY BAM SHALLOW LATER IN
THE FORECAST PERIOD. 

NOTE: PLEASE IGNORE THE LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION TO THE WEST OF
CELIA GENERATED BY THE AVN MODEL.  THIS FEATURE IS SO LARGE AND SO
UNREALISTIC IN THE MODEL THAT CELIA IS PRACTICALLY NOT REPRESENTED.

WARMED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...SUGGESTING THAT WINDS SHOULD SOON
DECREASE FROM THE ESTIMATED 50 KT ON THIS ADVISORY.  TWO SHIP
REPORTS...ONE AT 12Z AND ONE FROM VWSD AT 03Z...IMPLY A SOMEWHAT
SMALLER CIRCULATION THAN PREVIOUSLY INDICATED.
 
THE 06Z AVN...LIKE ITS PREDECESSORS...CONTAINS SPURIOUS STRONG
VORTICES IN ITS INITIALIZATION WHICH WILL LIKELY HAVE AN ADVERSE
IMPACT ON ITS TRACK FORECAST OF CELIA.  NOTWITHSTANDING...THE
CONTROLLING FEATURE FOR TRACK IS THE STRONG ANTICYCLONE THAT IS
FORECAST TO REMAIN TO THE NW TO N OF CELIA FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
THAT HIGH AND THE INCREASING INFLUENCE OF LOW-LEVEL STEERING SHOULD
DRIVE CELIA GENERALLY TOWARD THE NW AND THEN THE WNW AS INDICATED BY
MOST TRACK GUIDANCE AND THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.
 
GIVEN THE FORECAST TRACK AND THE REDUCED WIND RADII...IT IS LIKELY
THAT THE THREAT TO SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA IS LESSENED.
ACCORDINGLY...THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO IS DISCONTINUING THE

SST ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM IS ENTERING 24-25C WATERS.
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB INDICATE THAT
CELIA IS ON A WEAKENING TREND WITH T-NUMBERS OF 2.5 AND 3.0
RESPECTIVELY.  THUS...THE INTENSITY WILL BE LOWERED TO 40 KNOTS
FOR THIS ADVISORY.  GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THE
SYSTEM EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE WITHIN 48 HOURS.
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS SHOWS THAT CELIA HAS
BEEN MOVING ON A MORE WESTERLY HEADING.  THIS IS CONFIRMED BY 06Z
TAFB AND SAB FIX LOCATIONS.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 275/10
KNOTS.  THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE THAT RELY ON AVIATION MODEL FIELDS
...WHICH CONTINUE A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS...ARE
CONSIDERED SUSPECT DUE TO THE SPURIOUS VORTEX SOUTHWEST OF CELIA.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK CALLS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION
THROUGH 48 HOURS.  THIS IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH CLIPER...
NOGAPS AND UKMET GUIDANCE AND IS CONSISTENT WITH LOWER TROPOSPHERIC
STEERING.

8 AM PDT SUN JUL 19 1998

ALTHOUGH DEEP CONVECTION HAS DECREASED...CELIA STILL HAS A WELL-
ORGANIZED CLOUD PATTERN.  DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS SHOW LITTLE CHANGE
IN STRENGTH SO CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 40 KNOTS.  SINCE
VERTICAL SHEAR IN THE STORM/S ENVIRONMENT IS LIGHT...WEAKENING WILL
BE SLOW.  NONETHELESS AS SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES IN THE CYCLONE/S
PATH ARE IN THE 22-23 DEG C RANGE IT IS LIKELY THAT THE SYSTEM WILL
BE DISSIPATING IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

NOT MUCH CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE TO THE TRACK FORECAST.  MOTION
CONTINUES SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST NEAR 9 KNOTS.  THE CURRENT
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND IS GENERALLY
TO THE SOUTH OF THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE.  AS HAS BEEN NOTED
EARLIER...MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS LIKELY BEING ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY A LARGE SPURIOUS VORTEX IN THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
SITUATED ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO THE SOUTHWEST OF CELIA.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS BECOME RATHER SPARSE IN CELIA...ALTHOUGH A FEW
CELLS SPORADICALLY DEVELOP NEAR THE CENTER.  THE CYCLONE IS STILL
FAIRLY WELL-ORGANIZED AND IS ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR MINIMAL TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH...AS PER DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM THE TPC TROPICAL

FORECAST SINCE SST/S ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE 22-23 DEG C RANGE
ALONG THE PATH OF THE SYSTEM.  CELIA SHOULD BE DISSIPATING IN A

NO CHANGES TO THE MOTION ARE APPARENT AND THE TRACK FORECAST FROM
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY IS MERELY EXTENDED FARTHER TO THE WEST. 
AGAIN...AS NOTED EARLIER...THE LACK OF REAL DATA AND THE PRESENCE OF

DVORAK T-NUMBERS OF 2.0...AND TO SUPPORT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO
TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIVE-E.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS MOST PROMINENT
IN THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE...REPRESENTING A CHANGE FROM YESTERDAY
WHEN A SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR WAS EVIDENT.  THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN MOVING
TOWARD ABOUT 290/11 KT.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND SOUNDING DATA SHOW AN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED

AVN AND GFDL IMPLY SOME WESTWARD RIDGING OF THE HIGH TO THE NORTH OF
THE STORM.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS BASED ON THAT DEVELOPMENT AND
SHOWS A MOSTLY WNW TO W MOTION WITH SOME ACCELERATION.
 
A HIGH LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY CURRENT IS IMPINGING ON THE NORTHWEST

DARBY CONTINUES ON A CLIMATOLOGICALLY-FAVORED WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/10 KNOTS.  DARBY/S MOTION
APPEARS TO BE CONTROLLED PRIMARILY BY THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH

DRIFT WEST IN RESPONSE TO THE WESTWARD BUILDING RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST ACCEPTS THIS SCENARIO...AND IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ONE SHOWING A GENERAL WEST/WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION.
 
UPPER AIR ANALYSIS AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS NO IMPEDANCE TO
FURTHER INTENSIFICATION.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST WITH

2 PM PDT FRI JUL 24 1998
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/10.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
ALL SHOW A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION WITH SOME ACCELERATION THROUGN
72 HOURS...ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR FROM THE AVIATION MODEL 12Z RUN
AS TO WHY THE MOTION SHOULD ACCELERATE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND SHOWS
ONLY A SMALL ACCELERATION.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A WELL DEFINED EYE HAS FORMED OVER THE PAST
FEW HOURS AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 80 KNOTS.  THIS
IS BETWEEN THE 4.5 DVORAK T NUMBER FROM TAFB AND THE 5.0 T NUMBER
FROM SAB.  THE ONLY FACTOR TO AFFECT THE INCREASING INTENSITY TREND
IS THAT THE TRACK MOVES OVER SLIGHTLY COOLER WATER AFTER 36 HOURS.

HURRICANE DARBY DISCUSSION NUMBER   8
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT FRI JUL 24 1998

DARBY HAS INTENSIFIED RAPIDLY DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AND MAXIMUM
WINDS ARE 100 KNOTS.  THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON SUBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS
FROM SAB...TAFB AND RAW NUMBERS OBTAINED FROM THE NEW OBJECTIVE
DVORAK TECHNIQUE (ODT). THESE RAW NUMBERS HAVE BEEN OSCILLATING
AROUND 5.0 AND 6.0.  THE CLOUD PATTERN IS EXCELLENT AND CONSISTS OF
A DISTINCT EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A CDO...WELL DEFINED CURVED BANDS AND
OUTFLOW IN ALL QUADRANTS. DARBY HAS AT LEAST 24 MORE HOURS OVER WARM
WATERS...SO ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS POSSIBLE.  THEREAFTER... THE
HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO CROSS THE 25 DEGREE ISOTHERM AND WEAKENING
SHOULD BEGIN.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WEAKENS THE HURRICANE IN
AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS MODEL BUT SLOWER THAN SHIFOR AND MUCH SLOWER
THAN THE GFDL.  THE GFDL WEAKENS DARBY TO A 50-KNOT STORM IN ABOUT
36 HOURS. 
 
DARBY...LIKE MOST OF THE EASTERN PACIFIC HURRICANES IS MOVING AT
290/10.  SINCE THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE
...THIS MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH 72 HOURS. THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH GUIDANCE.

DARBY HAS LIKELY BEEN UNDERGOING A CONCENTRIC EYEWALL PHASE AS
SUGGESTED BY INFRARED AND MICROWAVE DATA.  ANALYSES FROM THE

DARBY IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT SKILLS IN
PREDICTING INTENSITY CHANGES ARE LOW.  THIS IS DIFFICULT PROBLEM
THAT BOTH OPERATIONAL AND RESEARCH COMMUNITIES ARE TRYING TO
OVERCOME.  HURRICANE SPECIALISTS AND EVERY AVAILABLE MODEL...RANGING
FROM THE SIMPLE SHIFOR TO THE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED STATE OF THE ART
GFDL...FORECAST WEAKENING.
 
DARBY DID NOT WEAKEN AS FORECAST AND IN FACT...IT COULD BE A LITTLE
BIT STRONGER TODAY IF THE NEW OBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS ARE CONSIDERED.
THESE NUMBERS ARE PEAKING AROUND A 6.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE.
HOWEVER...MORE RELIABLE SUBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS FROM SAB AND TAFB
REMAIN ABOUT 5.5 GIVING AN INTENSITY OF ABOUT 100 KNOTS.  THE
HURRICANE HAS A DISTINCT AND LARGE EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A WELL
DEFINED CDO BUT WITHOUT BANDING FEATURES.  DARBY IS MOVING PARALLEL
TO THE 25 DEGREE SST ISOTHERM SO ONLY A SLOW WEAKENING IS INDICATED
AND AS SUGGESTED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.    

DARBY IS MOVING AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A STRONG DEEP LAYER MEAN
ANTICYCLONE WHICH IS FORECAST TO PERSIST.  THEREFORE...NO
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TRACK IS FORECAST DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36
HOURS.  THEREAFTER...AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED AND A SMALL TURN
TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED AS SUGGESTED BY MOST OF THE
GUIDANCE.  ON THIS TRACK...IN ABOUT 48 TO 60 HOURS...DARBY WILL BE
CROSSING 140 DEGREES WEST...MOVING INTO THE HONOLULU AREA OF

CONVECTIVE TOPS HAVE WARMED OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS OR SO...BUT DARBY
REMAINS VERY WELL-ORGANIZED WITH A WELL-DEFINED EYE ESTIMATED TO BE
ABOUT 25 N MI IN DIAMETER.  THUS FAR...DARBY HAS KEPT FAR ENOUGH TO
THE SOUTH SO AS TO AVOID THE STRONGER VERTICAL SHEAR NEAR 20N
LATITUDE.   THE HURRICANE APPARENTLY UNDERWENT AN EYEWALL
REPLACEMENT CYCLE OVER THE PAST 24 TO 36 HOURS...LEADING TO THE
SECOND PEAK IN INTENSITY.  IT IS NOT CERTAIN WHETHER THE SYSTEM WILL
GO THROUGH ANOTHER SUCH CYCLE OR NOT.  THIS LIKELY DEPENDS ON HOW
MUCH LONGER THE ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC ENVIRONMENT REMAIN
FAVORABLE.  SINCE THE CURRENT TREND SUGGESTS SLOW WEAKENING...AND
EYEWALL CYCLES ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORETELL...GRADUAL WEAKENING
IS PREDICTED AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY PACKAGE.

THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE MOTION OR THE TRACK
FORECAST.  STEERING WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE DOMINATED BY A DEEP-
LAYER MEAN RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF DARBY...ALONG ABOUT 27N LATITUDE. 
THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS THIS RIDGE EXTENDING THROUGH
145W LONGITUDE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

8 PM PDT MON JUL 27 1998

DARBY CONSISTS OF A LARGE EYE SURROUNDED BY AN EYEWALL AND NO
BANDING FEATURES. T-NUMBERS ARE ALREADY DECREASING BUT DARBY REMAINS
AS 100-KNOT HURRICANE AS INDICATED BY CI NUMBERS.  IT APPEARS THAT
THE WEAKENING PROCESS SHOULD BEGIN SOON. 

NOTHING HAS CHANGED...THE SAME STEERING PATTERN...AND THE SAME
MOTION...275/13.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS TURN DARBY MORE TO THE
WEST-NORTHWEST BEYOND 48 HOURS AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. 
DARBY IS EXPECTED TO CROSS 140W AND MOVE INTO THE HONOLULU AREA OF
RESPONSIBILITY IN A DAY OR SO.

HURRICANE DARBY DISCUSSION NUMBER  21
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT TUE JUL 28 1998

THE EYE IS BECOMING DIFFUSE AND OVERALL DARBY LOOKS WEAKER THAN IT
WAS 24 HOURS AGO.  CURRENT MAXIMUM WINDS ARE REDUCED TO 90 KNOTS. 
THE HURRICANE IS CURRENTLY CROSSING THE 25 DEG C SST ISOTHERM AND
FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY.  THE RATE OF WEAKENING WILL LIKELY
INCREASE LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL
SHEAR.

THE DIRECTION OF MOTION HAS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY MORE TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST BUT NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS MADE TO THE TRACK FORECAST
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  DARBY SHOULD BE NEARING THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF A DEEP-LAYER MEAN RIDGE IN A FEW DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS QUITE CLOSE TO THE LATEST GFDL MODEL GUIDANCE.

DARBY HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN THIS MORNING WITH CONVECTION HAVING
DECREASED IN BOTH COVERAGE AND INTENSITY.  MOREOVER...THE EYE IS 
NO LONGER DISCERNIBLE IN INFRARED SATELLITE PICTURES.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS DECREASED TO 85 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY IN LINE WITH
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB.  THE INTENSITY
FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE WITH GRADUAL
WEAKENING THROUGH THE PERIOD AS THE SYSTEM ENCOUNTERS COOLER
WATERS AND INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR.  THE STRONGER
UPPER-LEVEL SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW IS EVIDENT NEAR 140W IN
SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND ANALYSES BY THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES.  
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/14 KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK CONTINUES A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH THE PERIOD
...AND IS SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  DARBY
SHOULD BE CROSSING 140W WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS...BRINGING IT INTO
THE CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES THIS AFTERNOON SHOW THAT THE STRATOCUMULUS
CLOUD FIELD WEST OF DARBY IS BECOMING INVOLVED WITH THE WESTERN
FLANK OF THE SYSTEM.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DECREASE IN THE
AREAL COVERAGE OF DEEP CONVECTION.  THE CURRENT INTENSITY IS LOWERED
TO 75 KNOTS...IN LINE WITH CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...
SAB AND KGWC.  THE WEAKENING TREND OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WILL 
BE ACCELERATED SOMEWHAT BRINGING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS
WITHIN 12 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE SYSTEM SHOULD CONTINUE TO UNWIND
AS IT MOVES INTO INCREASING SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR AND
PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATERS. 
 
SATELLITE FIXES DURING THE DAY SUGGEST THAT DARBY IS MOVING ON A
SLIGHTLY MORE WESTERLY TRACK...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE
IS ADJUSTED TO 280/14 KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM IS NEARING THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF THE DEEP-LAYER MEAN RIDGE WITH A MORE NORTHERLY
COMPONENT OF MOTION EXPECTED BY 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK CALLS FOR A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION BEYOND 24 HOURS
AND IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH BAM SHALLOW...THE GFDL...AND THE
AVIATION TRACK GUIDANCE.

THE CURRENT FORECAST BRINGS DARBY TO 140W...DENOTING THE CENTRAL
PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY....LATER TODAY.

HURRICANE DARBY DISCUSSION NUMBER  24
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT TUE JUL 28 1998
 
DARBY CONTINUES TO WEAKEN...IN PART DUE TO SLOWLY COOLING WATERS
ALONG THE TRACK AND IN PART TO INCREASING SHEAR.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY NOW SHOWS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW/TROUGH TO THE WEST GREATLY
DISTORTING DARBY/S MOISTURE PATTERN WITH AN ELONGATED PLUME HEADING
NORTHWARD.  DEEP CONVECTION...AS MEASURED BY TOPS LOWER THAN -50C...
IS RAPIDLY DIMINISHING.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED
AT 70 KT.  INITIAL MOTION IS NEAR 285/16 KT.
 
DARBY APPEARS TO BE ROUNDING THE WESTERN EXTENSION OF THE RIDGE AND
SHOULD CONTINUE TO GAIN IN NORTHWARD COMPONENT...UNTIL IT WEAKENS TO
THE POINT OF BEING STEERED BY THE LOW-LEVEL CURRENT IN A DAY OR TWO.
THE NHC TRACK IS PARALLEL TO BAMM FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS AND THEN
PARALLEL TO BAMS THEREAFTER.
 
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS NOW CROSSING 140W AND ENTERING THE CENTRAL
PACIFIC HURRICANE BASIN.  FUTURE INFORMATION ON THIS SYSTEM WILL BE
PROVIDED BY THE NWS CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER IN HAWAII.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIX-E DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT WED JUL 29 1998
 
AN AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER CENTERED ABOUT 150 NMI SOUTH-SOUTHWEST
OF ACAPULCO MEXICO HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY AND IS BEING
UPGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIX-E.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/06 AND IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN SINCE
THE CIRCULATION HAS BEEN TRACKED FOR ONLY ABOUT 12 HOURS OLD.  THE
MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES A RIDGE WILL PERSIST TO THE NORTH OF THE
DEPRESSION CAUSING IT TO MOVE ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD TRACK
FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS
REASONING.
 
THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF STRONG VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ALONG THE FORECAST
TRACK AND GRADUAL STRENGTHENING TO 60 KNOTS IN 72 HOURS IS FORECAST.
THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL CALLS FOR HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 48 HOURS
BUT SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THE DEEP CONVECTION TO BE WEAKENING AT
PRESENT.  SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE SHIPS
MODEL.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB MIAMI AND SAB
WASHINGTON ARE AT 35 KNOTS...SUPPORTING THE UPGRADING OF THE SYSTEM
SOUTH OF MANZANILLO MEXICO TO TROPICAL STORM ESTELLE.  THE CYCLONE
CONTINUES TO DEVELOP...WITH CONSIDERABLE DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE
ESTIMATED CENTER AND BANDING FEATURES TRYING TO TAKE SHAPE OVER THE
NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST QUADRANTS.   WITH WEAK VERTICAL SHEAR OVER
THE AREA AND SST/S IN THE 28-29 DEG C RANGE...FURTHER STRENGTHENING
SEEMS INEVITABLE.

THE CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS WESTWARD AT 10-11 KNOTS.  THERE IS A
LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH DRAPED ACROSS THE AREA NORTH OF ESTELLE.
CONSEQUENTLY THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS THE CURRENT WESTWARD
MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS IS ALSO IN GENERAL
AGREEMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS...AND ONLY
SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.

8 AM PDT THU JUL 30 1998

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB MIAMI AND SAB INDICATE THAT
THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS OF ESTELLE HAVE INCREASED TO 45 KNOTS.
THE SYSTEM APPEARS WELL ORGANIZED WITH STRONG CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER. THE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK
REMAIN ABOVE 28 DEG C FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS AND THE STORM IS LOCATED
SOUTH OF AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE. THEREFORE FAIRLY RAPID
INTENSIFICATION IS PREDICTED...IN AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME (SHIPS).  
 
THE CURRENT MOTION IS WESTWARD ABOUT 10 KNOTS AND THIS GENERAL
MOTION IS EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE AVN RUN
INDICATES THAT ESTELLE WILL REMAIN SOUTH OF THE UPPER LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS. A SLIGHT INCREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED IS EXPECTED AS ESTELLE MOVES TO THE SOUTH OF THE RIDGE AXIS.
THIS MOTION IS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.

ESTELLE CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED WITH SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 55 KNOTS FROM TAFB MIAMI AND SAB. DEEP
CONVECTION IS OCCURRING ON ALL SIDES OF THE SYSTEM AND THE
PRESENTATION ON THE VISIBLE IMAGE IS IMPRESSIVE. THE STORM SHOULD
REMAIN OVER WARM WATER AND SOUTH OF AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE
THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD SO THE CURRENT STRENGTHENING TREND IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. 

THE PREDICTED TRACK HAS CHANGED LITTLE SINCE THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.
THE WEST TO WEST NORTHWEST MOTION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR THE
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE BAM AND GFDL MODELS SUGGEST A SOMEWHAT SLOWER
MOTION THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. THE FORECAST TRACK IS MORE
CONSISTENT WITH THE STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL MODEL NHC91 WHICH HAS
PERFORMED WELL IN THE EAST PACIFIC SO FAR THIS SEASON.

ESTELLE IS LARGE TROPICAL CYCLONE AND HAS CONTINUED TO INTENSIFY. T-
NUMBERS ARE OSCILLATING AROUND 5.0 AND 5.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE. AN
EYE IS CLEARLY OBSERVED ON IR IMAGES AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF BANDING
FEATURES. WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 95 KNOTS. FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS
INDICATED EXCEPT SOME WEAKENING BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD
WHEN ESTELLE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER COOLER WATERS.

INITIAL MOTION IS 270/13. THERE IS A PERSISTENT AND SOLID DEEP LAYER
MEAN RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ESTELLE. THIS PATTERN WILL SUGGEST A
GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS. THIS IN GOOD

THE INTENSIFICATION TREND HAS...AT LEAST TEMPORARILY...CEASED.  THE
EYE HAS BECOME ILL-DEFINED ON INFRARED IMAGERY AND THERE IS AN
EROSION OF THE COLD CLOUD TOPS OVER THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE

FLUCTUATION OR THE BEGINNING OF A LONG-TERM WEAKENING TREND.
ESTELLE IS CURRENTLY CROSSING THE 27 DEG C SST ISOTHERM...SO FURTHER
WEAKENING SEEMS PLAUSIBLE.  HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES...
THE CURRENT INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS A RELATIVELY SLOW DECAY.  LATE
IN THE PERIOD...SEA TEMPS COULD BE NEAR 24 DEG C SO ESTELLE MIGHT BE
CONSIDERABLY WEAKER THAN SHOWN HERE.
 
GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS INDICATE THAT A WELL-ESTABLISHED MID-

ESTELLE HAS SLOWED ITS FORWARD MOTION CONSIDERABLY IN COMPARISON TO
LAST NIGHT.  CURRENT ESTIMATE IS SET AT 12 KNOTS...AND AFTER JOGGING
A LITTLE TO THE WEST-SOUTHWEST...IT IS MOVING WESTWARD AGAIN.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOMMODATE THE SLOWER
INITIAL MOTION...BUT CONTINUES TOWARD THE WEST.  THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN WHICH SHOWS A LARGE MID-LEVEL
RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ESTELLE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 

ONLY A SMALL AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION IS FOUND...OVER THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE CYCLONE.  CURRENT DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB
AND SAB AGREE AT 55 KNOTS.  CONTINUED GRADUAL WEAKENING DUE TO
COOLER WATERS AND A MORE STABLE ATMOSPHERE IS EXPECTED.

THERE HAS BEEN A FURTHER SLOWING OF THE FORWARD MOTION OF ESTELLE...
TO NEAR 10 KNOTS...STILL TOWARD THE WEST.  CONSEQUENTLY THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST HAS BEEN SLOWED JUST A BIT MORE BUT OTHERWISE IS BASICALLY
UNCHANGED.  
 
DEEP CONVECTION HAS PRACTICALLY VANISHED AT THIS TIME.  CURRENT
INTENSITY NUMBER IS 3.0 FROM BOTH THE TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER AND
THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE DATA INFORMATION SERVICE...
CORRESPONDING TO A WIND SPEED OF 45 KNOTS.  EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A
LARGE...WELL-DEFINED CIRCULATION...AND WILL BE RATHER SLOW TO SPIN
DOWN...ESTELLE SHOULD BE REDUCED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION IN A DAY
OR TWO AND DISSIPATING AROUND THE END OF THE PERIOD.

THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS POORLY ORGANIZED AND APPEARS TO BE

CONFIRMED BY A FEW SHIP REPORTS WITH WINDS BLOWING AWAY FROM THE
CIRCULATION.  CONVECTION IS LIMITED AND DISORGANIZED AND T-NUMBERS

ENOUGH OF A SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN A 25-KNOT DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME BUT
THE SYSTEM COULD DEGENERATE INTO A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE.  

THE ENVIRONMENT IS CLIMATOLOGICALLY FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING IN
THIS BASIN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EFFECTS OF COOL WATERS.  SO...I
WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF CONVECTION REDEVELOPS AND WINDS INCREASE
SOME.  THIS STRENGTHENING MUST OCCUR SOON BECAUSE AFTER 24
HOURS...THE DEPRESSION WILL LIKELY MOVE OVER 25 DEGREE WATER AND
RAPID WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 325/09. THIS TRACK IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WITH A

WINDS SOUTH AT 25 KNOTS...WITH 1008.7 MB FOLLOWING A 3 HR PRESSURE
RISE OF 3.1 MB.  ALSO AT 18Z...WINDS OF 20 KT AND 33 KT WERE
REPORTED BY TWO SHIPS NOT FAR FROM EACH OTHER ABOUT 130 NMI TO THE
NE OF THE CENTER IN THE VICINITY OF A CONVECTIVE BAND.
 
THE 12Z AVN IS SIMILAR TO THE 06Z RUN...WITH A WEAKNESS IN THE
HEIGHT PATTERN TO THE NW AND A FORECAST TRACK IN THAT DIRECTION. 
THE AVN BASED GUIDANCE HAS MOSTLY NW TRACKS.  THE NHC FORECAST IS
AGAIN TO THE RIGHT OF ALL THAT GUIDANCE AND FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE 00Z
NOGAPS.  OUR TRACK IS SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS NHC
FORECAST.
 
THE SYSTEM COULD REMAIN OVER RELATIVELY WARM WATERS FOR THE NEXT DAY
OR TWO...AND IS NOW FORECAST TO REACH TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  A
TROPICAL STORM WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO FOR
THE SOUTHERN PART OF BAJA CALIFORNIA. 
 
RAINFALL OVER BAJA CALIFORNIA COULD INDUCE FLASH FLOODS AND MUD
SLIDES.

VISIBLE AND INFRARED SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM HAS
GOTTEN BETTER ORGANIZED IN THE PAST 6 HOURS.  TAFB NOTES A FOUR
TENTHS BANDING FEATURE ON THE BD CURVE AND HAS A T NUMBER OF 2.5. 
SAB IS STILL GIVING A T NUMBER OF 2.0  AT 2100 AND OOOO UTC SEVERAL
SHIPS PASSING ABOUT 100 NM TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER REPORTED
25 TO 33 KNOTS OF WIND.  BASED ON THIS WE ARE UPGRADING THE
DEPRESSION TO TROPICAL STORM FRANK WITH MAXIMUM WINDS OF 35 KNOTS.
THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO INTENSIFY SLIGHTLY AND THAN DECREASE AS IT
MOVES OVER COOLER WATERS IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO.

FRANK IS MOVING ABOUT 360/07.  THIS INITIAL MOTION AND OUR TRACK
FORECAST WILL BRING THE STORM APPROXIMATELY PARALLEL TO THE BAJA
PENINSULA AND WOULD KEEP THE STRONGEST WINDS JUST OFFSHORE. 
HOWEVER...A SLIGHT TURN BACK TO THE NORTH COULD BRING THE SYSTEM
INLAND OVER BAJA.  THUS THE TROPICAL STORM WATCH WILL REMAIN IN
EFFECT AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY MAY BE CHANGED TO TROPICAL STORM
WARNINGS LATER TONIGHT OR TOMORROW.
 
MOST TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO TURN THE SYSTEM TOWARD THE
WEST-NORTHWEST OR NORTHWEST.  HOWEVER THE NAVY NOGAPS AND LBAR MODEL
TRACKS DO PARALLEL THE COASTLINE.  THE NHC FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND VERY CLOSE TO THE NAVY NOGAPS TRACK
FORECAST.
 
RAINFALL OVER BAJA CALIFORNIA COULD INDUCE FLASH FLOODS AND MUD

2 AM PDT SAT AUG 08 1998

SATELLITE...SURFACE AND RADAR OBSERVATIONS FROM MEXICO INDICATE THAT
FRANK IS MOVING NORTHWARD ABOUT 11 KNOTS.  FRANK IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO
THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA THAT TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS 
MAY REACH A PORTION OF THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA. THEREFORE
... A TROPICAL STORM WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED FROM CABO SAN LAZARO TO
PUNTA ABREOJOS.  SINCE THE STORM IS FORECAST TO MOVE PARALLEL TO
BAJA CALIFORNIA...A TROPICAL STORM WATCH HAS BEEN EXTENDED
NORTHWARD TO PUNTA EUGENIA.  

A WEAKNESS OF THE 500 MB HIGH TO THE NORTHWEST OF FRANK IS CAUSING
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO MOVE NORTHWARD. BECAUSE THE MODELS BUILD THE
RIDGE ONCE AGAIN IN 24 TO 36 HOURS...A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST
IS FORECAST.  THIS NORTHWEST TRACK IS REFLECTED IN MOST OF THE TRACK
MODELS.

THERE IS AN AREA OF DEEP AND CIRCULAR CONVECTION OVER THE CENTER OF
THE TROPICAL STORM AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 2.5 FROM
BOTH TSAF AND SAB.  WINDS ARE KEPT AT 35 KNOTS BUT FRANK COULD
STRENGTHEN SOME BEFORE REACHING COOL WATERS IN 24 HOURS. 
 
RAINFALL OVER PORTIONS OF BAJA CALIFORNIA COULD INDUCE FLASH FLOODS

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 350/10.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWS A
TURN TOWARD THE WEST IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO EXCEPT FOR LBAR AND THE
DEEP BAM WHICH MOVE THE STORM NORTHWEST AND THEN NORTHWARD.  THE 00Z

THE STORM AND MOVES THIS SYSTEM MOSTLY WESTWARD WHILE REBUILDING A
RIDGE TO THE NORTH.  THIS INITIALIZATION MAY NOT BE VERY ACCURATE. 
IN ANY CASE...THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY SHOWING A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND DECELERATION.  

DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES KEEP FRANK AT MINIMAL STORM STRENGTH...
35 KNOTS.  THERE ARE COLD SSTS ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK AND
WEAKENING IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.

THE FORECAST TRACK KEEPS THE CENTER WITHIN ABOUT 50 NAUTICAL MILES
OF THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND IT IS
RECOMMENDED THAT TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS NOW BE ISSUED FROM PUNTA
TOSCA TO PUNTA EUGENIA.

THERE IS AN OUTER RAINBAND LOCATED OVER THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA.

FUTURE INTENSITY OF SYSTEM POTENTIALLY GOVERNED BY SEVERAL FACTORS. 
CURRENTLY...THE TD SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE UNDER NORTHEASTERLY
SHEAR...WITH BAM GUIDANCE IMPLYING STRONG NW SHEAR BY THE END OF THE

TO NORTH MOVEMENT BUT THIS IS PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SPURIOUS
VORTEX INITIALIZED ABOUT 7 DEG WEST OF GEORGETTE.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST KEEPS A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST THEN NORTHWEST MOTION BY
72 HOURS.  THIS IS MIDWAY BETWEEN BAM DEEP AND LBAR...AND IS ON

SATELLITE IMAGES EARLY THIS EVENING SHOW THAT GEORGETTE HAS
CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN.  T-NUMBERS ARE 3.0/3.0/2.5 FROM
TAFB/GLOBAL/SAB RESPECTIVELY. INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 45 KNOTS. 
THE OUTFLOW OVER THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE CONTINUES TO BE HINDERED BY
THE DEVELOPING UPPER-LEVEL LOW NORTH OF THE SYSTEM AS SEEN IN THE
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR STRENGTHENING
TO HURRICANE IN 24 HOURS BUT LITTLE CHANGE AFTER THAT...IN LINE WITH
SHIPS AND GFDL GUIDANCE.
 
GEORGETTE IS INTERACTING WITH THE DEVELOPING UPPER LEVEL LOW TO THE
NORTH OF THE SYSTEM.  THE SYSTEM HAS SLOWED TO ABOUT 5 KNOTS AND IS
CONTINUING TO TAKE ON MORE OF A NORTHERLY COMPONENT IN DIRECTION
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 305/05.  THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO MOVE WESTWARD.  LATEST GUIDANCE FROM THE
BAMD...GFDL...NAVY NOGAPS AND P91 MODELS SUGGEST A SLOW FORWARD
MOTION UNTIL THE UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES TO THE WEST AND THEN AN
INCREASE IN FORWARD MOTION AND A MOVEMENT TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED TRACKS AND IS
SOMEWHAT TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

THE TRACK HAS EDGED A LITTLE MORE TO THE RIGHT...315/7 KT...
PRESUMABLY IN RESPONSE TO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GEORGETTE AND THE
UPPER-LEVEL LOW NOW CENTERED ABOUT 500 NM TO THE NORTH.  GEORGETTE
HAS A SMALL...BUT GROWING...SPOT OF DEEP CONVECTION AT THE ESTIMATED
CENTER OF CIRCULATION AND A STRONG BAND OF CONVECTION THAT WRAPS
INTO THE CENTER FROM THE SW-S-E-N.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
SUPPORT INCREASING THE WIND SPEED TO 50 KT.  A SHIP ABOUT 160 NM NE
OF THE CENTER REPORTED 25 KT WINDS AND 15 FT SEAS AT 0600 UTC.
 
THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST HAD THE TRACK OF GEORGETTE WRAPPING AROUND
THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE UPPER LOW...WHICH THE AVN FORECASTS WILL
CONTINUE TO MOVE WESTWARD.  THE 00Z GFDL AND AVN HAVE SIMILAR
SOLUTIONS TO THAT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS...SHOWING A TURN TOWARD THE
NORTH AND THEN AN ACCELERATION BACK TOWARD THE NW.  IT IS NOT
CLEAR...HOWEVER...WHETHER THEY DO SO BECAUSE OF THE UPPER LOW OR...
INSTEAD...BECAUSE OF A RESIDUAL MODEL VORTEX INITIALIZED BY THE AVN
NEAR 12N 119W.  THE NHC FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE OFFICIAL TRACK OF
6 HOURS AGO AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE...BETWEEN GFDL AND

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT WED AUG 12 1998
 
GEORGETTE HAS CONTINUED TO INTENSIFY THIS MORNING WITH A WELL-
DEFINED BANDING FEATURE WRAPPING AROUND THE SYSTEM.  THE OVERALL
CLOUD PATTERN HAS IMPROVED MARKEDLY OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.  
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB ARE NOW 4.0...65 KNOTS...
AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 65 KNOTS.  THIS MAKES
GEORGETTE THE 4TH HURRICANE OF THE EAST PACIFIC SEASON.  THE
INTENSITY FORECAST CONTINUES THE STRENGTHENING TREND THROUGH 
24 HOURS...WITH A GRADUAL WEAKENING BEYOND 48 HOURS AS THE
SYSTEM ENCOUNTERS 23/24C WATERS.  THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH
THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME (SHIPS). 

A SHIP LOCATED ABOUT 180NM NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER REPORTED A SSE
WIND OF 25 KNOTS AND SEAS OF 15 FT.  ACCORDINGLY...THE TROPICAL
STORM-FORCE WIND AND 12-FOOT SEA RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED.
 
SATELLITE PICTURES THIS MORNING SUGGEST THAT GEORGETTE/S FORWARD
MOTION HAS INCREASED...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 310/
10 KNOTS.  THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW LOCATED ABOUT 460NM NORTH OF THE
SYSTEM CONTINUES TO MOVE WESTWARD...AS FORECAST BY THE AVIATION
MODEL.  THIS SHOULD KEEP GEORGETTE ON A MORE NW TRACK HEADING.  
MOST OF THE 12Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWEST
MOTION...AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST REFLECTS THIS.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BAM DEEP AND NHC91.  THIS
REPRESENTS A SLIGHT LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

GEORGETTE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A BANDING-TYPE HURRICANE.  THE SYSTEM
HAS A LARGE ENVELOPE AS INDICATED BY SATELLITE IMAGERY AND SURFACE
SHIP REPORTS.  A SHIP LOCATED ABOUT 205 NMI NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER
...ID KGTI...REPORTED AN E WIND OF 20 KNOTS AND SEAS OF 16 FT. 
BASED ON THIS DATA THE TROPICAL STORM-FORCE WIND AND 12-FOOT SEA
RADII HAS BEEN MODIFIED.  

DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE IN AGREEMENT...
AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 70 KNOTS FOR THIS
ADVISORY. WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED OUTFLOW AND NO OBVIOUS FACTORS TO
HINDER DEVELOPMENT...GEORGETTE IS FORECAST TO GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN
THROUGH 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A GRADUAL WEAKENING TREND SHOULD
BEGIN AS THE SYSTEM APPROACHES PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATERS...NEAR 
22 DEG C BY 72 HOURS.
 
GEORGETTE HAS CONTINUED ON A NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH THE DAY.  
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/11 KNOTS.  THE MID- TO UPPER-
LEVEL LOW POSITIONED ABOUT 450 NMI NORTH OF GEORGETTE CONTINUES 
TO MOVE WESTWARD WITH A RIDGE BUILDING TO ITS EAST.  THIS SYSTEM 
IS HAVING LITTLE IMPACT ON THE HURRICANE...PER WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
...AND IS FORECAST TO WEAKEN.  THE 18Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS 
MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED AROUND A GENERAL NORTHWEST TRACK MOTION.

GEORGETTE CONTINUES AS A BANDING TYPE HURRICANE WITH AN EXCELLENT
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW. THE EYE IS NOT OBSERVED ON SATELLITE IMAGES YET
BUT T-NUMBERS FROM SAB AND TAFB HAVE INCREASED TO 4.5 ON THE DVORAK
SCALE.  THE WINDS ARE THEN ADJUSTED TO 75 KNOTS IN THIS ADVISORY.
CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST DURING THE NEXT 36 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...A GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN AS THE HURRICANE MOVES
OVER COOLER WATER.

INITIAL MOTION IS 305/12.   MOST OF THE MODELS ARE SUGGESTING THAT
THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE WILL EXPAND WESTWARD.
THEREFORE...THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  TRACK MODELS...INCLUDING THE LATEST GFDL SUGGEST A GRADUAL
TURN MORE TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST AS THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH
BECOMES BETTER ESTABLISHED...AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL

THE EYE IS QUITE LARGE...30-35 NMI IN DIAMETER AND IS SURROUNDED BY
A SOLID RING OF DEEP CONVECTION.  INTERESTINGLY...THERE IS ALMOST NO
VERY DEEP CONVECTION ELSEWHERE.  THE WIND SPEED IS AGAIN ESTIMATED
TO BE 100 KT AS IMPLIED BY THE 5.5 TAFB AND SAB T-NUMBERS. GEORGETTE
TOOK A JOG TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS.  IT HAS COME BACK A LITTLE BUT A SMOOTHED VERSION OF ITS
MOTION SINCE LAST EVENING GIVES A HEADING OF ABOUT 315 DEGREES AT 13
KT.  THE WIND AND 12 FT SEAS RADII NW OF CENTER HAVE BEEN EXPANDED
BASED ON THE OBSERVATIONS FROM SHIP KGTI AT 03Z AND 06Z.
 
IT IS HARD TO RECONCILE THE RECENT MOTION WITH FEATURES ANALYZED IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OR SHOWN IN THE 00Z AVN INITIALIZATION.  THERE
DOES APPEAR TO BE A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATION...
PERHAPS CLOSED...TO THE NNW OF THE HURRICANE.  IT MIGHT BE RELATED
TO THE VORTEX NOTED IN PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS AND THE CIRCULATION ON
THE SE SIDE OF IT COULD BE HELPING TO ACCELERATE GEORGETTE ON A MORE
NORTHWARD HEADING.  THIS MIGHT BE TEMPORARY.  OTHERWISE...THE AVN
LARGE-SCALE PATTERN IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS RUNS.  THE TRACK
MODELS COVER THE HEADINGS FROM W TO NW AND HAVE SUBSTANTIAL
DIFFERENCES IN SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A SLOW BEND BACK
TOWARD WNW AND GRADUAL DECELERATION.
 
THE CENTER OF GEORGETTE WILL BE CROSSING THE 25C SST ISOTHERM TOWARD

HURRICANE GEORGETTE DISCUSSION NUMBER  15
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT FRI AUG 14 1998
 
DVORAK T NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 4.5 BUT THE CURRENT INTENSITY
NUMBERS REMAIN AT 5.5 OR NEAR 100 KNOTS.  THE WIND SPEED IS
DECREASED TO 95 KNOTS AT 21Z BASED ON A WEAKENING TREND AND COLD
SSTS ARE EXPECTED TO WEAKEN GEORGETTE TO A DEPRESSION BY 72 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 315/15.  SOME OF THE MODEL
GUIDANCE...INCLUDING THE DEEP BAM...THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL
P91E...AND THE LBAR...SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH INTO A WEAKNESS
IN THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE.  HOWEVER GEORGETTES
EXPECTED WEAKENING SHOULD RESULT IN A MORE WESTWARD STEERING BY THE
LOWER LEVEL FLOW AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS FOR A GRADUAL
MORE WESTWARD MOTION ALONG WITH SOME DECELERATION...SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

A SHIP REPORT OF 20 KNOTS AT A POSITION ABOUT 80 NMI NORTHEAST OF
THE CENTER AT 18Z SUGGESTS THAT THE 34-KNOT WIND SPEED RADIUS OF 175
NMI IS TOO LARGE.  HOWEVER THE SAME SHIP HAD RATHER HIGH SEAS AND
COULD BE BETWEEN CONVECTIVE BANDS.  SO THE RADIUS IS LEFT AT 175
MILES IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT UNTIL THERE IS ADDITIONAL
CONFIRMATION OF A SMALLER RADIUS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT FRI AUG 14 1998

GEORGETTE IS MOVING OVER INCREASING COOLER WATERS...ALREADY OVER 23
DEGREES CELSIUS.  THEREFORE...RAPID WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN.  THE EYE
IS DISAPPEARING AND CONVECTION IS DECREASING QUICKLY. HOWEVER... NO
SURPRISE IF CONVECTION TEMPORARILY REDEVELOPS DURING THE NEXT 12 TO
24 HOURS.  T-NUMBERS STILL SUPPORT 85 TO 90 KNOTS SINCE DVORAK RULES
DO NOT PERMIT SUCH A FAST WEAKENING.  GEORGETTE IS LIKELY TO BE A
SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS IN 24 TO 36 HOURS AND PROBABLY WILL BE DECLARED
DISSIPATED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 315/14. THIS GENERAL TRACK IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  A TURN MORE TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST IS
FORECAST AS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WEAKENS AND BECOMES STEERED BY THE
LOW-LEVEL FLOW.  TRACK MODELS ARE DIVERGENT BEYOND 36 HOURS WITH
MOTIONS EITHER SLOW OR FAST AND TRACKS TO THE NORTHEAST...NORTH AND
WEST. THE BEST OPTION IS TO USE BAM-SHALLOW WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF
THE LOW-LEVEL STEERING AND ITS PROBABLY APPROPRIATE FOR A RAPID
WEAKENING SYSTEM.

DEEP CONVECTION IS DIMINISHING IN COVERAGE AND IT IS BECOMING
DIFFICULT TO DISCERN AN EYE ON IR IMAGERY.  WHILE DVORAK CI NUMBERS
AT 06 UTC WERE 5.0 FROM TAFB AND SAB...GEORGETTE IS EXPECTED TO
QUICKLY WEAKEN OVER COOLER WATERS DURING THE WEEKEND.  THE HURRICANE
CONTINUES MOVING TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AT ABOUT 13 KNOTS.
 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A CYCLONIC CIRCULATION CENTER ABOUT 500 NM
NW WEST OF GEORGETTE AND THIS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO A CONTINUATION OF
THE CURRENT HEADING FOR ANOTHER DAY OR SO.  THEREAFTER...GEORGETTE
IS EXPECTED TO BE MUCH WEAKENED AND MORE LIKELY STEERED BY LOWER

GEORGETTE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN OVER PROGRESSIVELY COLDER SSTS AND
THERE IS LITTLE DEEP CONVECTION REMAINING NEAR THE CENTER.  GALE

A SMALL AREA OF CONVECTION HAS INCREASED A LITTLE NEAR WHERE
EXTRAPOLATION AND CONTINUITY WOULD PLACE THE CENTER AT 18Z.  HOWEVER
A HOLE IN THE CLOUDS HAS RECENTLY APPEARED TO THE SOUTH.  THIS COULD
BE THE CENTER...NOT AN EYE...OR IT COULD BE A SUCKER HOLE.  A
COMPROMISE INITIAL POSITION IS SELECTED WHICH GIVES AN INITIAL
MOTION OF 305/10.  THIS RESULTS IN A CONTINUATION OF THE GRADUAL
SLOWING OF FORWARD SPEED AND A SLIGHT TURN TOWARD THE LEFT.  MOST OF

ONLY A FEW PATCHES OF WEAKENING CONVECTION TO THE NORTH OF THE
CENTER AT THIS TIME. LATEST ERS2 ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT WINDS ARE
AROUND 45 KNOTS WHILE DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE DECREASING.  THEREFORE
...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS ADJUSTED TO 45 KNOTS.  SINCE GEORGETTE
IS OVER COOL WATERS IT SHOULD WEAKEN TO AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE

AN EYE FEATURE HAS APPEARED IN SATELLITE IMAGERY THE LAST SEVERAL
HOURS AND INDICATES STRENGTHENING.  DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM 
TAFB AND SAB ARE 5.0 AND 4.5 RESPECTIVELY.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY
IS INCREASED TO 85 KNOTS.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST ALONG
THE LINES OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/12.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72 HOURS...AND
THE SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK.  THIS REPRESENTS A SLIGHT
LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII HAS BEEN ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY DUE
TO SEVERAL 06Z SHIP REPORTS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/12.  THE GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A
CONTINUATION OF THIS GENERAL MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE AVIATION
MODEL 00Z RUN SHOWS SOME WEAKENING OF THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE
HURRICANE SO THAT THERE COULD BE SOME SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED 
AND PERHAPS A SLIGHT TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
SHOWS SLIGHT DECELERATION AFTER ABOUT 48 HOURS.

WITH A WELL DEFINED EYE...THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 95 KNOTS
AND INTENSIFICATION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER 24 HOURS. 
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...SLIGHTLY COOLER SSTS COULD
START A WEAKENING TREND.

THROUGH ABOUT 36 HOURS.  AFTER THIS TIME GFDL AND NOGAPS MAKE A
GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE NORTH...WHILE ALL THE BAMS...UKMET...AND

INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 130 KNOTS.  THE FORECAST IS FOR SOME
FURTHER STRENGTHENING...FOLLOWED BY SLOW WEAKENING AFTER 12 HOURS AS

IS WHAT MOST OF THE GUIDANCE IS SHOWING FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THIS
SHIFTS THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS

NORTH COULD SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED AND MOVE THE HURRICANE A LITTLE
FURTHER NORTH.
 
THE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATE FROM TAFB IS T NUMBER 6.5 OR 127
KNOTS.  HOWEVER THE COLDEST TOPS HAVE WARMED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS
AND THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS DECREASED FROM 130 TO 125 KNOTS ON
THIS BASIS.  THE FORECAST WIND SPEEDS ARE DECREASED SOME FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY ALSO BECAUSE OF THE ABOVE SUGGESTION THAT THE

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW A LARGE EYE ASSOCIATED WITH HOWARD
SURROUNDED BY A RING OF DEEP CONVECTION BUT NO BANDING FEATURES. 
LOW LEVEL STRAT0-CUMULUS CLOUDS ARE BEING ADVECTED INTO HOWARD AND
THIS COMBINED WITH COOLER SSTS ARE BEGINNING TO WEAKEN THE SYSTEM. 
DVORAK T-NUMBERS HAVE ALL DECREASED TO 5.5.. SO INITIAL INTENSITY IS
SET AT 105 KTS. CONTINUED WEAKENING IS FORECAST. 
 
HOWARD HAS SLOWED DOWN SO THAT THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/08.  THE
MODEL ENSEMBLE GENERALLY TAKES THE SYSTEM TOWARD THE WEST-
NORTHWEST...ALSO AT A SLOWER PACE. THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS SLIGHTLY
SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND SOMEWHAT SLOWER.

HOWARD CONTINUES ITS SLOW DECLINE.  ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM STILL
HAS A WELL-DEFINED EYE...ABOUT 30 NM IN DIAMETER...THE SURROUNDING
CONVECTION HAS WEAKENED.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH
TAFB AND SAB ARE NOW 5.5...102 KNOTS.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
REDUCED TO 100 KNOTS.  THE GRADUAL WEAKENING TREND SHOULD CONTINUE
AS HOWARD APPROACHES COOLER WATER.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/09 KNOTS.  THE RIDGE NORTH OF HOWARD
SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  MOST OF THE DYNAMIC-
BASED MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS A WEST-NORTHEAST MOTION THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD.  A 24-HOUR SATELLITE LOOP SHOWS THAT HOWARD HAS BEEN ON
A GENERAL WESTWARD COURSE...NOTWITHSTANDING A WOBBLE OR TWO.
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST CALLS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING

SEMICIRCLE OF THE SYSTEM.  AVERAGING THE LATEST DVORAK SATELLITE
CLASSIFICATION INTENSITIES FROM TPC AND NESDIS YIELD A CURRENT
INTENSITY OF 60 KNOTS...SO HOWARD IS DOWNGRADED TO A STORM ON THIS
ADVISORY.  HOWARD IS MOVING INTO AN AREA OF MARGINAL SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES... AND SATELLITE-DERIVED ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN CIMSS SHOW INCREASED VERTICAL SHEAR AHEAD OF THE
CYCLONE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS STEADY WEAKENING AS IN
PREVIOUS PACKAGES.

THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN FORECASTS A LOW- TO MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO BUILD SOMEWHAT TO THE NORTH OF HOWARD.  ALSO
AS THE CYCLONE WEAKENS...IT SHOULD TEND TO BE STEERED MORE BY THE
FLOW IN THE LOWER HALF OF THE TROPOSPHERE.  HOWARD/S CURRENT

LARGE...MONSOON-LIKE...SYSTEM SOUTH OF BAJA CALIFORNIA...A SHIP
REPORTED 997 MB WHILE ANOTHER HAD 40 KT AT 18Z.  BASED ON THIS
SURFACE DATA...THE DISTURBANCE IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM ISIS
WITH 45 KT WINDS.  DUE TO THE LOOSE STRUCTURE THE INITIAL POSITION
AND MOVEMENT ARE UNCERTAIN.  CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 350/8 KT.
 
THE 06Z AND 12Z AVN MODEL RUNS TAKE ISIS NORTHWARD TOWARD SOUTHERN
BAJA CALIFORNIA AND THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA...ALTHOUGH PART OF THE
MOTION COULD HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY THE EXTRANEOUS MODEL VORTEX TO THE
WEST. THE UKMET OUTPUT FROM 12Z IS NOT TOO DIFFERENT...SHOWING ISIS
MOVING ALL THE WAY UP THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA WITHIN 3 DAYS.  OTHER
GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY SIMILAR...AS IS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST BUT THE AMOUNT OF INTENSIFICATION WILL BE
HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON HOW MUCH THE SYSTEM INTERACTS WITH LAND.
 
A TROPICAL STORM WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT FOR THE SOUTHERN PART OF
BAJA CALIFORNIA.

RADAR DATA FROM THE MEXICAN WEATHER SERVICE/S DOPPLER RADAR IN CABO
SAN LUCAS SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER OF TROPICAL STORM ISIS IS ABOUT
35 MILES SOUTHEAST OF CABO SAN LUCAS. MOREOVER...A SHIP OBSERVATION
WAS RECEIVED LOCATED JUST WEST OF THE ESTIMATED RADAR LOCATION
REPORTING NORTHEAST WINDS AT BEAUFORT FORCE 10...48-55
KNOTS...AND A 993 MB PRESSURE.  BASED ON THIS DATA...THE CENTER OF
ISIS IS BEING RE-LOCATED NORTHWARD AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS INCREASED TO 60 KNOTS. THIS INTENSITY WILL BE HELD
THROUGH 36 HOURS WITH GRADUAL WEAKENING THEREAFTER AS THE SYSTEM
BECOMES MORE INVOLVED WITH LAND. 

THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO IS EXTENDING THE TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS
ON THE BAJA PENINSULA SOUTH OF A LINE SANTA ROSALIA TO PUNTA
ABREAJOS....AND MAINLAND MEXICAN COAST FROM ELDORADO TO GUAYMAS. 

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 360/09 KNOTS.  ISIS SHOULD CONTINUE
MOVING NORTHWARD IN RESPONSE TO A MID-LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING
SOUTHWARD FROM THE SOUTHWEST U.S. INTO THE EASTERN PACIFIC.  MOST
OF THE 00Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWARD HEADING
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO....AND IS IN CLOSEST
AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL MODELS P91E AND P9UK.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT WED SEP 02 1998

A VERY LARGE SYMMETRICAL AREA OF VERY DEEP CONVECTION... TOPS TO 
-80C...HAS BEEN FIRING FOR THE LAST 3-4 HOURS AROUND THE SUSPECTED 
CENTER OF ISIS.  RECENTLY A BANDING-TYPE FEATURE HAS BECOME EVIDENT
SOUTH AND EAST OF THE CENTER ALONG THE COAST OF MEXICO TO NEAR
PUERTO VALLARTA.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 60 KNOTS
FOR THIS ADVISORY.  WITH THE FAIR TO POOR OUTFLOW AND THE SYSTEMS
PROXIMITY TO LAND NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST THROUGH 36
HOURS.  BEYOND 36 HOURS SOME GRADUAL WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS
ISIS BECOMES MORE INVOLVED WITH MAINLAND MEXICO.  

THE LAST AVAILABLE RADAR IMAGE FROM THE MEXICAN WEATHER SERVICE/S
DOPPLER RADAR IN CABO SAN LUCAS...AROUND 05Z...PLACED THE CENTER 
ABOUT 60-70 MILES SOUTHEAST OF CABO SAN LUCAS.  THIS POSITION
ESTIMATE IS CONFIRMED BY SSM/I...85GHZ IMAGERY OBTAINED FROM THE
U.S. NAVY RESEARCH LABORATORY IN MONTEREY.  THE SYSTEMS FORWARD
SPEED HAS DIMINISHED OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS AND THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS NOW 360/5 KNOTS.

A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD
FROM THE SOUTHWEST U.S. INTO THE EASTERN PACIFIC IS FORECAST TO 
KEEP ISIS ON A GENERAL NORTHERLY COURSE THROUGH 24 HOURS WITH
A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST THEREAFTER.  MOST OF THE 
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK. THE NHC TRACK IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH LBAR 
AND THE UKMET...ALBEIT SLIGHTLY FASTER. 

THE 12-FOOT SEA RADII IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT HAS BEEN EXPANDED 
TO 275 NMI BASED ON 06Z SHIP DATA.

THE TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE UNCHANGED FOR THIS ADVISORY.

THIS SYSTEM WILL POSE A SIGNIFICANT HEAVY RAINFALL THREAT FOR
INLAND AREAS WITH POSSIBLE FLASH FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES IN HIGH
TERRAIN REGIONS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT WED SEP 02 1998
 
IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER OF ISIS ON IR IMAGES.
SHIP REPORTS HAVE HELPED...AND IMPLY A NORTHWARD MOTION OF ABOUT 7
KT.  CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS NEAR THE
CENTER...PERHAPS DUE TO INTERACTION BETWEEN THE INNER CIRCULATION
AND THE NARROW MOUNTAIN RANGE THAT RUNS DOWN THE SPINE OF BAJA
CALIFORNIA.
 
THE 06Z AVN INITIALIZATION SHOWS A LARGE-SCALE ANTICYCLONE IN THE
SHAPE OF AN INVERTED V DRAPED OVER ISIS.  HENCE...THE FUTURE COURSE
OF ISIS WILL BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE HIGH.  AT
PRESENT...THE MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE PART OF THE RIDGE TO THE EAST
AND NE WILL DOMINATE AND STEER ISIS TO THE NW TO N.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT EVOLUTION...WITH MOST MODELS
SHOWING TRACKS UP THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA.

THE OFFICIAL TRACK FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS
BASED ON THAT TRACK.  A SMALL DEVIATION TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT WOULD
PUT THE CENTER OVER LAND AND LEAD TO WINDS LESS THAN WHAT WE SHOW IN
THE FORECAST.  IT IS RARE...BUT NOT UNPRECEDENTED...FOR A TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO MOVE UP THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA.  KATRINA IN 1967 IS AN
EXAMPLE OF A HURRICANE THAT CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.
 
REGARDLESS...HEAVY RAINFALL FROM THIS SYSTEM POSES A THREAT FOR
FLASH FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES.

RADAR DATA FROM MEXICO/S WEATHER SERVICE SITE AT GUASAVE...AND MORE
RECENTLY THE APPEARANCE OF AN EYE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...HAS HELPED
LOCATE THE CENTER OF ISIS OVER THE SOUTHERN GULF OF CALIFORNIA. 
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH SURFACE OBSERVATIONS TAKEN 75-100 NM FROM
THE CENTER AT LA PAZ AND CULIACAN.  IT IMPLIES A MOTION OF ABOUT 005
DEGREES/10 KT.  ALTHOUGH WINDS AT THOSE SURFACE SITES ARE ONLY 10 KT
AND 20 KT...RESPECTIVELY...AND DEEP CONVECTION DOES NOT COMPLETELY
ENCIRCLE THE CENTER...THE SYSTEM IS UPGRADED TO A 65 KT HURRICANE
BASED ON THE SATELLITE PICTURES.
 
WHILE THE GUIDANCE AGAIN TAKES ISIS TO THE NORTHWEST TO NORTH
THROUGH 72 HOURS...MOST OF THE TRACKS THIS TIME HEAD INLAND OVER
MAINLAND MEXICO...AS WOULD BE IMPLIED WITHIN 12 HOURS BY
EXTRAPOLATION OF THE CURRENT MOTION.  IF THAT HAPPENS IT WOULD
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE DURATION OF THE STORM/S LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION AND ITS POTENTIAL TO GENERATE ORGANIZED DEEP CONVECTION.
THE NHC TRACK IS MORE CAUTIOUS...SHOWING SOME BENDING BACK TO A
NORTHWEST MOTION...WITH ISIS MOVING UP THE EAST SIDE OF THE GULF OF
CALIFORNIA.  IT ALSO SHOWS A FASTER MOVEMENT THAN IN THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST...AS DOES THE GUIDANCE.
 
REGARDLESS OF THE ABOVE IMPORTANT DETAILS ABOUT TRACK...ISIS WILL
CONTINUE TO BE A FLOOD THREAT TO MEXICO FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  FOR
THE U.S. SOUTHWEST...THE 12Z 200-300 MB FORECASTS BY THE NOGAPS...
AVN...GFDL...AND ETA...SHOW AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW DEVELOPING OFFSHORE
FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE FORECAST CONFIGURATION AT THIS TIME
KEEPS RATHER STRONG WESTERLIES OR SOUTHWESTERLIES OVER NORTHWEST
MEXICO TO THE SOUTH OF THE LOW.  THIS WOULD CREATE A SHEARING
ENVIRONMENT IF ISIS MOVES INTO THAT REGION...AND ONE WHICH WOULD
LIKELY ADVECT MUCH OF ISIS/S MOISTURE TO THE EAST AND NORTHEAST...
MOSTLY TOWARD EASTERN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO.  IF THE TROUGH DROPS
FARTHER SOUTHWEST OR BECOMES MORE NEGATIVELY-TILTED...THEN ISIS
COULD BE DRAWN MORE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...AT A FASTER SPEED...AND
WOULD THEN BRING MOISTURE FARTHER TO THE WEST.

SATELLITE IMAGERY ALONG WITH RADAR DATA FROM MEXICO/S WEATHER
SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR AT GUASAVE SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER OF
ISIS IS MAKING LANDFALL AT THIS TIME...JUST SOUTH OF LOS MOCHIS. 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS FROM LOS MOCHIS SINCE 02/2245Z.  THE
SYSTEM HAS A NICE RADAR PRESENTATION AND SHOWS THAT THE HEAVIEST
RAINS ARE OCCURRING OVER INLAND SECTIONS JUST NORTH AND EAST OF 
LOS MOCHIS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS ISIS AS A HURRICANE
AT ADVISORY TIME FOLLOWED BY WEAKENING AS THE SYSTEM INTERACTS 
WITH LAND. 

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 005/10 KNOTS.  MOST OF THE 00Z
TRACK GUIDANCE CONTINUE TO MOVE ISIS TO THE NORTHWEST THROUGH 72
HOURS.  THE SYNOPTIC REASONING REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM THE LAST
PACKAGE AS MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW
DEVELOPING OFFSHORE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  THIS WOULD RESULT
IN THE ADVECTION OF MUCH OF ISIS/S ASSOCIATED MOISTURE EAST AND
NORTHEAST TOWARD EASTERN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO.  IF THE TROUGH
DROPS FARTHER SOUTHWEST OR BECOMES MORE NEGATIVELY-TILTED...THEN
ISIS COULD BE DRAWN MORE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...AT A FASTER SPEED
...AND WOULD THEN BRING MOISTURE FARTHER TO THE WEST.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS ISIS MOVING NORTHWARD THROUGH 
12 HOURS WITH A NORTH-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION BEYOND.  
THIS REPRESENTS A SLIGHT RIGHT ADJUSTMENT...THEREFORE A MORE 
INLAND TRAJECTORY...THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED PRIMARILY 
ON THE INITIAL MOTION.  

AS MENTIONED IN EARLIER ADVISORIES THE PRIMARY THREAT FROM ISIS 
WILL BE HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS RESULTING IN
POSSIBLE FLASH FLOODS...AND MUDSLIDES IN HIGH TERRAIN.  A STORM 
SURGE OF 3-5 FEET ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS IS POSSIBLE IN THE
WARNED AREA.  ALL INTERESTS IN THE WARNING AREA SHOULD RUSH ALL

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT MON SEP 07 1998

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE TO THE SOUTH OF CABO SAN LUCAS HAS
GRADUALLY BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE LAST DAY OR SO AND IS
NOW ESTIMATED TO HAVE BECOME A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  THE SYSTEM HAS
BEEN IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF EASTERLY SHEAR AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE CONVECTIVE CLOUD
MASS.  HOWEVER...NEW CONVECTIVE CELLS ARE BEING GENERATED NEAR THE
ESTIMATED CENTER AND THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW...WHICH HAD BEEN RATHER
PALTRY...IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT BETTER ESTABLISHED.  THEREFORE THE
SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE APPEARS TO BE LESSENING AND SOME
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR.  THIS IS SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...WITH COOLING OCEAN TEMPERATURES BRAKING THE
INTENSIFICATION PROCESS LATER IN THE PERIOD.

INITIAL MOTION...QUITE UNCERTAIN FOR A NEWLY-DEVELOPED TROPICAL
CYCLONE...IS ESTIMATED TO BE 300/09.  A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW SEEN
IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS WEAKENED THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ELEVEN-E.  MOREOVER THE NCEP
GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A SIZEABLE 500 MB TROUGH DROPPING INTO CALIFORNIA
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  THESE FLOW FEATURES COULD CAUSE THE TRACK TO
TURN MORE TO THE RIGHT...POSSIBLY EVEN RECURVE THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
TOWARD BAJA.  NOTWITHSTANDING...THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS FAVOR A
MORE SOUTHERN ROUTE...ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM LOOK A BIT BIZARRE.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES MORE WITH THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN AND TRENDS
MORE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  SUBSEQUENT FORECASTS MAY HAVE TO BE
ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT DEPENDING ON OBSERVED AND MODEL TRENDS.

THIS AFTERNOON WITH A CONVECTIVE BAND ATTEMPTING TO FORM ON THE
EAST SIDE OF THE CENTER.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL EXPERIENCING UPPER-
LEVEL EAST-NORTHEASTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR...APPROXIMATELY 100 MB...
RESULTING IN RESTRICTED OUTFLOW OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE. 
HOWEVER...ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL
SATELLITE STUDIES SUGGESTS THAT THE SHEAR WILL RELAX AS THE SYSTEM
MOVES NORTHWESTWARD.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB
ARE 2.0 AND 2.5...RESPECTIVELY.  THE INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS
MAINTAINED AT 30 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING 
IS FORECAST WITH THE SYSTEM ATTAINING TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY
WITHIN 12 HOURS.  AFTER 48 HOURS A WEAKENING TREND IS INITIATED
AS THE SYSTEM APPROACHES 24 DEG C SST/S.  
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/09 KNOTS.  AS WAS THE CASE AT 12Z
THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS CONSIDERABLE SCATTER.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK CALLS FOR A GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72
HOURS WITH A GRADUAL DECELERATION.  THE SYNOPTIC REASONING BEHIND
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE
AS MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS MOVE A RATHER EXPANSIVE MID-LEVEL
TROUGH...CURRENTLY POSITIONED NORTH OF 35N ALONG 140W...TO THE U.S.
WEST COAST DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS.  THIS COULD RESULT IN A
MORE NORTHERLY COURSE...POSSIBLY EVEN RECURVING THE SYSTEM TOWARD
THE BAJA PENINSULA.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST HAS BEEN ADJUSTED
SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY PRIMARILY DUE TO THE
INITIAL POSITION ESTIMATE.

BASED ON THE CURRENT FORECAST...NO WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE REQUIRED
FOR BAJA CALIFORNIA AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...ALL INTERESTS ALONG 
THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

SPECIAL GOES IR CHANNEL REVEALS A SHEARED CIRCULATION EXPOSED OVER
MOST OF THE NORTHEASTERN SEMICIRCLE.  CENTER POSITION ESTIMATES FROM
THIS IMAGERY IMPLY A SLOWER INITIAL MOTION THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED
...NEAR 290/4 KT.  INTENSITY ESTIMATES BASED ON A DVORAK SHEAR
PATTERN GIVE MAXIMUM WINDS AROUND 40 KT.
 
WITH THE SLOWER MOTION USED TO INITIALIZE THE TRACK MODELS...MOST
GUIDANCE SHOWS LITTLE NET MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  EARLY ON...THERE
IS AN INDICATION OF A CONTINUED SLOW WNW OR NW HEADING.  THEN...
THERE IS THE SUGGESTION OF A NORTHWARD TO EASTWARD DRIFT...PERHAPS
AS THE FORECAST TROUGH ALOFT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A SIMILAR HEADING TO 6 HOURS AGO...BUT PULLS
BACK THE FORECAST POINTS ALONG THAT TRACK.

INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST AND THIS ASSUMES THAT THE SHEAR WILL
DECREASE AND UPWELLING WILL NOT INHIBIT STRENGTHENING.
 
ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SHOULD
CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

CORRECTION TO ADVISORY NUMBER...6 INSTEAD OF 7
 
VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES DURING THE DAY INDICATE THAT THE
CENTER OF JAVIER IS EXPOSED EAST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.
 
SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER OF JAVIER IS NOW UNDER
THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 45
KNOTS.  THE UPPER-LEVEL SHEAR HAS DIMINISHED AND THE OUTFLOW HAS
IMPROVED SOMEWHAT.  THE MODEST STRENGTHENING TREND FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY IS MAINTAINED.
 
THE LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES IMPLY THAT JAVIER/S FORWARD
SPEED HAS SLOWED SLIGHTLY FROM THE LAST ADVISORY.  THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 285/03 KNOTS.  THE DRIVING FACTOR BEHIND
THE TRACK FORECAST CONTINUES TO BE THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH APPROACHING THE U.S. WEST COAST.  THE TROUGH
IS FORECAST TO EXTEND FAR ENOUGH SOUTH...NEAR 20N...BY 48 HOURS
TO PULL JAVIER NORTHWARD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A SLOW
WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A NORTHWEST
..THEN NORTH-NORTHWEST HEADING BEYOND 48 HOURS WITH A SLIGHT
ACCELERATION.  THIS FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.
 
THERE IS ONE CAVEAT TO THIS TRACK FORECAST...IF JAVIER STRENGTHENS
MORE THAN FORECAST IT COULD RECURVE SOONER.  ALL INTERESTS ALONG
THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

THE MOTION HAS BEEN STATIONARY FOR THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS DIVERGENT AS FAR AS DIRECTION OF MOTION IS
CONCERNED...BUT MOST OF THE MODELS SHOW VERY SLOW MOTION THROUGH 72
HOURS.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL WHICH SHOWS
THE STORM CUT OFF AND NEARLY STATIONARY.  THE AVIATION MODEL ALSO
SHOWS A TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES DIGGING SOUTHWARD JUST WEST OF THE
STORM AND THIS COULD GET THE STORM MOVING DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A LITTLE SLOWER AND A LITTLE
TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

THE LAST VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWED MOST OF THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION
EXPOSED AND THE DEEP CONVECTION WAS WELL WEST OF THE CENTER.  THIS
IS THE BASIS FOR DECREASING THE WIND SPEED TO 35 KNOTS.  THERE DOES
NOT APPEAR TO BE MUCH VERTICAL SHEAR NEARBY...EVEN THOUGH THE
EXPOSED CENTER SUGGESTS THE PRESENCE OF SHEAR.  THE FORECAST IS FOR
SOME STRENGTHENING AFTER 12 HOURS.

THE STORM IS RATHER CLOSE TO SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA...BUT THE
CURRENT WEAKENING TREND AND LOCATION OF THE DEEP CONVECTION
INDICATES THAT WARNINGS ARE NOT NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.

THE ONLY PERCEIVED MOVEMENT HAS BEEN A SLIGHT DRIFT TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...CLOSEST TO THE LIMITED
AREA BAROTROPIC MODEL LBAR...BUT NORTHEAST OF MOST OF THE
GUIDANCE...SHOWS A VERY MODEST INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED AND A
GRADUAL CURVE TO THE NORTHWEST.  ON THIS TRACK THE CENTER WILL PASS

CURRENTS HAVE COLLAPSED AND LITTLE OVERALL MOTION IS LIKELY DURING
THIS FORECAST PERIOD.  THE GFDL SHOWS ESSENTIALLY NO MOTION WHILE
MOST OTHER GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE MOTION TOWARD THE NORTHWEST OR

2 PM PDT THU OCT 01 1998
 
THE AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER LOCATED A FEW HUNDRED MILES SOUTH-
SOUTHEAST OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA HAS CONTINUED TO
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY.  VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS
THAT THE CENTER IS INVOLVED WITH A CLUSTER OF DEEP CONVECTION WHICH
HAS PERSISTED MOST OF THE DAY.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
BOTH TAFB AND SAB ARE NOW 2.0...30 KNOTS. THUS...ADVISORIES ARE
BEING INITIATED AND THE SYSTEM IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION
TWELVE-E.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 30 KNOTS.  SOME GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST ALONG THE LINES OF THE STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...BRINGING THE 
SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS BY 12 HOURS.
 
THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/5 KNOTS.  THE
DEPRESSION IS IN A WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT AND A SLOW WEST-
NORTHWEST MOTION IS EXPECTED WITH A MORE WESTERLY TRACK BY 72 
HOURS.  A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
WILL LIKELY BYPASS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.

THE DEPRESSION IS POORLY ORGANIZED AND DEEP CONVECTION IS DECREASING
AT THIS TIME.  BECAUSE T-NUMBERS REMAIN 2.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS KEPT AT 30 KNOTS.  SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST
MODEL DOES NOT INTENSIFY THE DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE GFDL
DISSIPATES IT BY 48 HOURS.  HOWEVER...THE OUTFLOW IS FAIR AND THE
OCEAN IS WARM...SO A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED AS SUGGESTED
IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 
 
THE DEPRESSION HAS BEEN MOVING LITTLE DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.
STEERING CURRENTS ARE WEAK AND ARE NOT FORECAST TO CHANGE.  MODELS
INDICATE TRACKS IN ALL DIRECTIONS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR
A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

ANALYSIS OF SATELLITE PICTURES PUTS THE CENTER CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY LOCATION...NEAR 21N109W.  SHIP REPORTS 50-75 NMI TO THE N

THIS IMPLIES THAT EITHER THE SURFACE CIRCULATION IS EXCEEDINGLY
SMALL...THERE IS NO SURFACE CIRCULATION CENTER...OR THE CENTER IS
LOCATED FARTHER TO THE NORTH THAN PREVIOUSLY ANALYZED AND WELL TO
THE NORTH OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY.  FOR THIS FORECAST
CYCLE...ADVISORIES WILL BE CONTINUED FOR A CENTER THAT IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE SHIP DATA.
 
WITH THE POOR ORGANIZATION CURRENTLY OBSERVED...NO INTENSIFICATION
WILL BE SHOWN FOR THE SHORT TERM.  THE GFDL AND UKMET DISSIPATE THE
TD NEARLY IN PLACE DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THE SHIPS SCHEME
SHOWS SLOW WEAKENING BY THREE DAYS.  THE OTHER TRACK GUIDANCE HAS

THE FIRST VISIBLE IMAGERY SUGGESTS A WEAK LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION NEAR
20.0 109.5.  THIS IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND
VIOLATES THE 06Z C6LF9 SHIP REPORT AT 21.4N 109.6W WITH A WIND OF
230/27.  IF THAT SHIP IS CORRECT...THEN THERE IS NO WELL DEFINED LOW
LEVEL CIRCULATION.  REALIZING THE LARGE UNCERTAINTY IN LOCATING THE
CENTER OF A WEAK SYSTEM...THE INITIAL POSITION IS PUT AT 20.O 109.5
AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AS STATIONARY.
 
THE GUIDANCE DIVERGES QUITE A BIT WITH THE NOGAPS SHOWING A SLOW
NORTHWEST TO NORTHWARD MOTION......THE LBAR SHOING A NORTHEASTWARD
MOTION...THE AVIATION MODEL SHOWING A MOSTLY SOUTHWARD MOTION...AND
THE GFDL AND UKMET SHOWING VERY LITTLE MOTION.  THE FORECAST
RESOLVES THIS DIVERGENCE BY HOLDING THE DEPRESSION STATIONARY.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE IS LITTLE
ORGANIZED DEEP CONVECTION AND HOLDS THE WIND SPEED AT 30 KNOTS UNTIL
36 HOURS WHEN THE WIND IS INCREASED TO 35 KNOTS FOLLOWING THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT MON OCT 12 1998
 
WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING A TROPICAL DISTURBANCE LOCATED SEVERAL HUNDRED
MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA FOR SEVERAL
DAYS. THIS DISTURBANCE WAS INITIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ITCZ AND
BEGAN LIFTING NORTHWARD ON THE 10TH BECOMING DETACHED FROM THE ITCZ
ON THE 11TH. WHILE THE SYSTEM HAS HAD A SMALL WELL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION CENTER FOR THE LAST 18-24 HOURS THE COVERAGE OF DEEP
CONVECTION HAS BEEN MEAGER.  HOWEVER...THE AREAL EXTENT OF DEEP
CONVECTION HAS EXPANDED SUFFICIENTLY DURING THE LAST 6-9 HOURS TO
WARRANT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION STATUS. 
FURTHERMORE...DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM BOTH KGWC AND SAB ARE 
NOW 2.0.  THUS...ADVISORIES ARE BEING INITIATED ON TD THIRTEEN-E
AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 30 KNOTS.
 
SATELLITE ANIMATION SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BECOME MORE SYMMETRIC
AND ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL
SATELLITE STUDIES...CIMSS...AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN INDICATES
LITTLE VERTICAL WIND SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING
IS FORECAST..IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE PREDICTION
SCHEME..SHIPS..WITH THE SYSTEM ATTAINING TROPICAL STORM STATUS BY 
12 HOURS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 320/05 KNOTS.  THE DEPRESSION IS ON
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL RIDGE WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE
TO STEER THE SYSTEM ON A SLOW NORTHWESTERLY COURSE.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO AND IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT
WITH LBAR AND BAMD.  THE GFDL IS THE RIGHT-MOST OF THE GUIDANCE
TAKING THE SYSTEM ON A SLOW EAST-NORTHEAST HEADING THROUGH 72 HOURS.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON IR IMAGES BUT INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 310/04 BASED ON PAST 24 HOURS OF MOTION.  THE AVIATION
MODEL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DEPRESSION WILL MOVE NORTHWESTWARD
FOLLOWING THE LARGE SCALE STEERING CURRENTS FROM A RIDGE TO THE
NORTHEAST AND THIS IS SUPPORTED BY LBAR AND THE BAM MODELS.  HOWEVER
THE GFDL MODEL DRIFTS THE SYSTEM SOUTHEASTWARD FOR 30 HOURS AND THEN
DISSIPATES IT.  THE UKMET DRIFTS THE SYSTEM SOUTHWESTWARD FOR 3 DAYS
AND THE AVATION MODEL SHOWS LITTLE MOTION FOR 3 DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND A LITTLE
SLOWER...OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE DIVERGENCE OF THE GUIDANCE.

SOME CONVECTION CONTINUES TO PERSIST.  THE SHIPS MODEL CALLS FOR
SLIGHT STRENGTHENING AND THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME
AS THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

MAINTAINS KAY AS A HURRICANE THROUGH 48 HOURS...CONSISTENT WITH THE

DEEP CONVECTION HAS ESSENTIALLY VANISHED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS AND
KAY COULD BE WEAKENING AS FAST AS IT STRENGTHENED YESTERDAY.  DVORAK
TECHNIQUE RULES CONSTRAIN SATELLITE ANALYSTS FROM LOWERING THEIR
INTENSITY ESTIMATES TO BELOW A CI OF 3.5...55 KT...AT 1200 UTC. 
THERE COULD STILL BE A CIRCULATION ALOFT OF THAT STRENGTH.  IT IS
UNLIKELY...HOWEVER...LACKING A MECHANISM TO GENERATE/SUSTAIN SUCH A
STRONG WIND AT THE SURFACE OR TO TRANSPORT IT THERE FROM ALOFT...
THAT SURFACE WINDS ARE AS HIGH AS 55 KT.  ERS-2 DATA IMPLY WINDS NO
HIGHER THAN 40 KT...AND THIS IS THE OFFICIAL ESTIMATE FOR 1500 UTC.
 
THE BEND IN TRACK TOWARD THE LEFT CONTINUES WITH INITIAL MOTION NOW
SW...230/7 KT.  A SLOW WEST TO SW MOTION IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE AND

KAY IS NOW MOVING TOWARD THE SSW...WITH THE 12Z AVN SHOWING WEAK
STEERING CURRENTS TO PERSIST.  WHILE TROPICAL CYCLONES ARE NOT KNOWN
FOR STRENGTHENING WHEN MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION...WARMER WATERS ARE
AHEAD IN THIS CASE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SOME REDEVELOPMENT COULD
EVENTUALLY OCCUR.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS AND THE NHC FORECAST
SHOW A TURN BACK TOWARD THE WEST.  THE UKMET...WHICH SEEMS TO BE
DOING QUITE WELL ON THIS SYSTEM...CONTINUES THE CYCLONIC LOOP.

KAY HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN THIS EVENING WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION
HAVING ALL BUT DISAPPEARED.  ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A FLARE-UP IN
A NARROW BAND OF SOUTH AND WEST OF THE CENTER IT IS INSUFFICIENT 
FOR DVORAK CLASSIFICATION PURPOSES.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
REDUCED TO 30 KNOTS AND KAY IS DOWNGRADED TO DEPRESSION STATUS.
THE FORECAST HAS THE SYSTEM DISSIPATING BY 36 HOURS.   

THE DEPRESSION HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE IN A SOUTH-SOUTHWEST DIRECTION

GUIDANCE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A GRADUAL TURN BACK TOWARD THE WEST
...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS THIS SCENARIO.  THE AVN AND

A LIMITED AMOUNT OF DEEP CONVECTION HAS BEEN RECURRING NEAR THE
CENTER OF THE CYCLONE...SO THE SYSTEM IS BEING MAINTAINED AS A 30-
KNOT DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME.  THE FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR
DISSIPATION IN THE 36 HOUR TIME FRAME.

MOTION CONTINUES TOWARD THE SOUTH-SOUTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AND STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL
GUIDANCE.  THE NOGAPS MODEL ALSO SHOWS A FAIRLY SIMILAR TRACK.  AS
NOTED EARLIER...OTHER MODELS SUCH AS THE UKMET AND GFDL SHOW THE
SYSTEM LOOPING TOWARD THE EAST AND EAST-NORTHEAST IN A DAY OR TWO. 
THIS IS APPARENTLY IN RESPONSE TO A MID-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFYING NEAR
THE U.S. WEST COAST.  HOWEVER IT IS PRESUMED THAT KAY WILL BE SO
WEAK THAT IT WILL BE STEERED PRIMARILY BY THE NEAR-SURFACE NORTHEAST

AN INCREASING THREAT TO THE COAST OF SOUTHERN MEXICO AND POSSIBLY

...CORRECTION FOR INITIAL WIND SPEED...
 
TD 14-E HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW SIGNS OF STRENGTHENING THIS EVENING
WITH PROMINENT BANDING FEATURES AND A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION
ONGOING OVER/NEAR THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  DVORAK OBJECTIVE-BASED
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE NOW 3.0 FROM TAFB AND 2.5+ FROM SAB.  ON
THIS BASIS TD 14-E IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS...LESTER.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS 45 KNOTS. THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW
OVER THE SYSTEM IS WELL-ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST WITH LESTER BECOMING A HURRICANE BY 24 HOURS.  THIS IS
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS. THE ONLY INHIBITING FACTOR WILL LIKELY
BE THE SYSTEMS/S PROXIMITY TO LAND.
 
SATELLITE FIXES OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 6 HOURS SUGGEST THAT
LESTER HAS TURNED SLIGHTLY TO THE WEST. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE
IS NOW 305/6 KNOTS.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF
OF MEXICO WILL MOVE EASTWARD DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS IN
RESPONSE TO THE APPROACHING TROUGH FROM THE U.S WEST COAST.  THIS
SHOULD RESULT IN A GENERAL NORTHWESTERLY STEERING ENVIRONMENT.  MOST
OF THE 00Z TRACK MODELS ARE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED AROUND THIS SCENARIO
WITH VARIATIONS IN SPEED.  THE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS SOLUTION
ARE THE UKMET AND NOGAPS WHICH TURN THE SYSTEM BACK TO THE SOUTH
AND SOUTHEAST AND WEAKEN IT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS A
GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72 HOURS AND IS SLIGHTLY TO THE
LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
WITH THE LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT IN THE TRACK THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO
HAS EXTENDED TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS WESTWARD TO PUNTA MALDONALDO
AND HAS ISSUED A HURRIANCE WATCH FROM PUNTA ARISTA TO PUNTA
MALDONALDO.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT LESTER CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER
ORGANIZED WITH VERY DEEP CONVECTION WRAPPING AROUND THE CENTER. THE
OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED TO THE SOUTHWEST BUT IS ENOUGH TO FAVOR
STRENGTHENING.  LESTER IS FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE BEFORE
REACHING THE COAST IN 24 HOURS OR SO. THEREFORE...A HURRICANE
WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED ACCORDINGLY.

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 315/07.  MOST OF THE
HURRICANE MODELS SUGGEST THAT THIS GENERAL TRACK SHOULD CONTINUE
THROUGH THE NEXT 3 DAYS SINCE THE RIDGE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO
SHOULD MOVE EASTWARD.  ON THIS TRACK THE CENTER OF LESTER SHOULD BE
NEAR THE COAST WITHIN THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 24 HOURS. GLOBAL
MODELS DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE STORM AND
MOVE LESTER VERY LITTLE OR ERRATICALLY.

AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHT HAS CONFIRMED THE ESTIMATES MADE
FROM SATELLITE PICTURES EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.  THE HURRICANE
HUNTERS INITIALLY FOUND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 993 MB AND THEN 992
MB.  WHILE PEAK FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 70 KT WERE FOUND ON THE ONLY

TODAY...BUT AN EYE HAS BECOME VISIBLE ON SATELLITE PICTURES AND
DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE NOW 4.0.  LESTER IS UPGRADED TO A HURRICANE
WITH 70 KT SURFACE WINDS.
 
THE NW HEADING HAS PERSISTED...ALTHOUGH THE PAST FEW HOURS SUGGEST A
MORE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD HEADING.  THE FORWARD MOTION APPEARS TO HAVE
DECREASED TO ABOUT 5 KT.  THE 12Z AVN KEEPS LESTER ON THE SW SIDE OF

LANDFALL WITHIN 24 HOURS.  IN CONTRAST...THE UKMET AND NOGAPS SHOW

NORTHWESTWARD ON THE WEST SIDE OF THESE OBSTACLES...ALONG THE COAST
IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF ACAPULCO.  A MORE DRASTIC CHANGE IN

THE U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT MADE ITS PASS
THROUGH LESTER A FEW HOURS AGO AND REPORTED 85 KNOT SURFACE WINDS
AND A 973 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE FROM A GPS DROPSONDE. ON ITS EXIT
LEG THROUGH THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT IT FOUND A FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND OF
98 KNOTS.  BASED ON THIS DATA...THE INITIAL INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS
INCREASED TO 90 KNOTS. VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES HAVE SHOWN A FAINT

THE OUTFLOW IS WELL-ESTABLISHED OVER THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN
PORTIONS OF THE HURRICANE WHILE IMPROVING OVER THE NORTHERN
QUADRANT.  SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS STILL FORECAST...
CONSISTENT WITH THE OUTPUT FROM SHIPS. 
 
THE RECON FIX ALONG WITH SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT
LESTER HAS BEEN MOVING JUST SOUTH OF WEST OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS. 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 265/07 KNOTS. THIS A GENERAL
WESTWARD HEADING IS EXPECTED TO BE MAINTAINED FOR THE NEXT 24-36
HOURS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE
HURRICANE. THEREAFTER...A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE IS FORECAST AS
THE SYSTEM NEARS THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH
THE STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE MODEL NHC P91E.  THE GFDL IS THE
RIGHT-MOST OF THE TRACK PREDICTION GUIDANCE WHICH MOVES LESTER ON
A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THEN BENDS TOWARD THE NORTHWEST BEYOND 24
HOURS APPARENTLY IN RESPONSE TO THE TROUGH APPROACHING THE LOWER
U.S. WEST COAST.  BESIDES BEING INCONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT MOTION
HISTORICALLY THE GFDL HAS NOT BEEN A VERY GOOD PERFORMER WITH EAST
PACIFIC TROPICAL CYCLONES. 
 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT FORECAST TRACK SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHES THE
THREAT TO SOUTHERN MEXICO.  THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO WILL LIKELY
DISCONTINUE THE WATCHES AND WARNINGS LATER TODAY.  HOWEVER...ALL
INTERESTS IN THE WATCH AND WARNING AREA SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF LESTER SINCE COASTAL SECTIONS COULD STILL
EXPERIENCE SOME EFFECTS OF THIS HURRICANE.

THE INTENSITY...COVERAGE...AND ORGANIZATION OF DEEP CONVECTION
ASSOCIATED WITH THE HURRICANE HAS DIMINISHED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
HOURS...AND THE INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 85 KNOTS ON THIS ADVISORY. 
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW IS BEING IMPEDED TO THE NORTHEAST AT THIS
TIME.  AS LESTER CONTINUES FARTHER TO THE WEST...THE UPPER-LEVEL
FLOW MAY AGAIN BECOME MORE FAVORABLE...BUT GIVEN THE
UNCERTAINTIES...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST.

MOTION IS SLIGHTLY FASTER TOWARD THE WEST...AROUND 8 OR 9 KNOTS. 
OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION GUIDANCE AND THE 500 FLOW FORECAST FROM
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SUPPORT A CONTINUED GENERALLY WESTWARD MOTION
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD...A MORE
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION IS LIKELY AS LESTER NEARS A WEAKNESS IN
THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO THE NOGAPS AND
BAROTROPIC MODEL GUIDANCE.

AS A PRECAUTION...A HURRICANE WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR A PORTION OF
THE SOUTHERN COAST OF MEXICO.

THE DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH LESTER HAS MADE A COMEBACK
THIS MORNING WITH -80 DEG C TOPS NEAR/OVER THE CENTER.  DVORAK
CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB IS 90 KNOTS WHILE SAB AND
AFGW ARE 77 KNOTS.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 85 KNOTS.
THE HURRICANE IS STILL EXPERIENCING EAST/NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR WHICH
IS INHIBITING THE OUTFLOW NORTH AND EAST OF THE CENTER.  AS
MENTIONED EARLIER THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW MAY BECOME MORE CONDUCIVE
FOR STRENGTHENING AS THE SYSTEM MOVES WESTWARD...BUT GIVEN THE
UNCERTAINTIES...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST...
CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
LESTER HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE ON A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING AND THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/9 KNOTS.  THE FIRST VISIBLE SATELLITE
IMAGES SUGGEST THE CENTER MAY BE SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE 12Z FIXES
HOWEVER...WE WILL WAIT FOR A FEW MORE PICTURES BEFORE MAKING ANY 
ADJUSTMENT. THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE SHOULD
KEEP IT ON A GENERAL WESTWARD COURSE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH A
MORE WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING THEREAFTER AS LESTER APPROACHES A
WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE. MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE REFLECTS
THIS AND IS MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED THAN 6 HOURS AGO.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS IN
CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH NOGAPS.
 
A HURRICANE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR A PORTION OF THE SOUTHERN
COAST OF MEXICO.  THE WATCH WILL LIKELY BE DISCONTINUED LATER TODAY
AS THE HURRICANE SHOULD REMAIN WELL OFFSHORE.  HOWEVER...PORTIONS
OF THE SOUTHERN COAST OF MEXICO COULD EXPERIENCE SOME FRINGE EFFECTS
OF LESTER...NAMELY LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL
TIDES.

2 AM PDT TUE OCT 20 1998

THE HURRICANE HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED WITH THE CENTER APPARENTLY
EMBEDDED WELL WITHIN AN AREA OF QUITE COLD CLOUD TOPS.  DVORAK
ANALYSES FROM TAFB AND SAB GIVE A CONSENSUS T5.0 WHICH IS EQUIVALENT
TO A CURRENT INTENSITY OF 90 KNOTS.  NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN
STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

AS NOTED EARLIER...THERE ARE 2 GENERAL TRACK FORECAST SCENARIOS. 
ONE IS A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH IN 2-3 DAYS AS SHOWN BY THE DEEP-
LAYER BAM...LBAR AND THE GFDL MODEL.  THE OTHER IS A CONTINUED WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION AS SHOWN BY THE SHALLOW- TO MEDIUM-LAYER BAM
AND THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL MODEL.  THE LATTER SCENARIO ASSUMES
THAT THE HURRICANE WILL BE ESSENTIALLY UNAFFECTED BY A MID- TO
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH CURRENTLY ALONG 115W-120W NORTH OF 20N.  THE NCEP
GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS THIS TROUGH GRADUALLY LIFTING OUT IN 48 TO 72
HOURS...WHICH WOULD ARGUE AGAINST A NORTHWARD TURN.  HOWEVER THE
NOGAPS MODEL DOES NOT LIFT THE TROUGH OUT QUITE AS MUCH.
REGARDLESS...THERE WILL PROBABLY BE ENOUGH OF A WEAKNESS IN THE
RIDGE NEAR 110W-115W SO THAT LESTER SHOULD TURN AT LEAST
NORTHWESTWARD IN THAT VICINITY.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST FOR
THIS PACKAGE IS SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS
ONE...AND IS ESSENTIALLY BETWEEN THE 2 AFOREMENTIONED SCENARIOS.

AN EYE HAS BEEN SEEN INTERMITTENTLY OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS TOWARD
THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF A NEARLY CIRCULAR AREA OF STRONG CONVECTION.
DVORAK T-NUMBERS REMAIN AT 5.0 FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND THE ESTIMATE
OF WIND SPEED IS AGAIN 90 KT.
 
LESTER IS STILL MOVING TOWARD THE WNW BUT HAS ACCELERATED TO ABOUT
10 KT.  THE 00Z AVN SHOWED THE CUTOFF LOW OVER THE U.S. SOUTHWEST
DEVELOPING SOUTHWARD A LITTLE MORE BEFORE LIFTING OUT...AND SO DOES
THE 06Z RUN.  IN ITS WAKE...A LIGHT SOUTHWESTERLY CURRENT REMAINS AT
500 MB AND THIS SHOULD HELP INDUCE A GREATER NORTHWARD COMPONENT
WITH TIME.  THE TRACK FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS REASONING AND IS SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS SEVERAL PREDICTIONS.  IT REMAINS BETWEEN THE TWO
FORECAST TRACK SCENARIOS DESCRIBED 6 HOURS AGO.

QUITE CLOSE TO THOSE GIVEN BY THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY

CAUSE THE WEAKENING TO BE MORE RAPID THAN SHOWN HERE.

THE MOTION HAS SLOWED SLIGHTLY BUT IS STILL TOWARD THE WEST-

TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...IN RESPONSE TO A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE... WITH A TURN BACK TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST NEAR THE END OF THE

THIS DECELERATION COULD BE EVIDENCE OF LESTER NEARING THE WESTERN
EDGE OF THE RIDGE TO THE NE.  SOME ADDITIONAL NORTHWARD COMPONENT

THE INTENSITY AND COVERAGE OF DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH
LESTER HAS DECREASED MARKEDLY DURING THE LAST 6-12 HOURS...MOST 
LIKELY IN RESPONSE TO UPWELLING. IN FACT...BASED ON THE DVORAK
INTENSITY SCHEME THE CURRENT COVERAGE OF DEEP CONVECTION IS
INSUFFICIENT TO CLASSIFY THE SYSTEM AS A HURRICANE. HOWEVER...
THE CIRCULATION REMAINS INTACT AND TYPICALLY TROPICAL CYCLONES 
TAKE TIME TO UNWIND...A PROPERTY INCORPORATED INTO THE DVORAK
TECHNIQUE.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE REDUCED TO 65 KNOTS.
GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST WITH LESTER BECOMING A TROPICAL 
STORM BY 12 HOURS.
 
LESTER HAS BEEN STATIONARY FOR THE LAST 36 HOURS BUT SATELLITE 
FIXES OVER THE LAST 3-6 HOURS SUGGEST THAT A SOUTH TO SOUTH-
SOUTHWEST DRIFT HAS BEGUN. THIS IS CONFIRMED BY U.S. AIR FORCE 
AND U.S. NAVY DMSP FIXES/IMAGERY. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
200/02 KNOTS.  A SOUTH-SOUTHWEST TO SOUTHWEST DRIFT SHOULD CONTINUE
TODAY WITH A MORE WESTERLY MOTION THEREAFTER AS HIGH DEVELOPS
NORTHWEST OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS
THIS SCENARIO AND IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE NORTHWEST OF THE CONVECTIVE CLUSTER.  INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS
AT 40 KNOTS WHICH IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN VARIOUS DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES.  SHIPS GUIDANCE INDICATES WEAKENING DUE TO INCREASED
SHEAR WHILE THE GFDL SHOWS A LITTLE STRENGTHENING.  THEREFORE...THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/09.  HOWEVER...THE DYNAMICAL MODELS
...GFDL...NOGAPS...AND UKMET...ALL INDICATE A SLOW DOWN AS STEERING
CURRENTS WEAKEN.  OUR CURRENT TRACK IS ADJUSTED CONSIDERABLY BASED
ON THIS AND IS A BLEND BETWEEN THE DYNAMICAL MODELS AND THE
SHALLOW/MID LAYER BAMS.  IF LESTER WERE TO BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY
STRONGER THAN FORECAST...A MORE RAPID RECURVATURE TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST COULD OCCUR...SIMILAR TO THE DEEP LAYER BAM.

2 AM PDT SUN OCT 18 1998

AN EYE HAS NOT BEEN APPARENT ALTHOUGH RECENT ENHANCED IR IMAGES SHOW
A BIT OF A WARM SPOT NEAR THE APPARENT CENTER.  THE DEEP CONVECTION
CONTINUES TO BE ASYMMETRIC WITH COLDEST TOPS PRIMARILY OVER THE
SOUTHWEST SEMICIRCLE.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS FAIRLY STRONG EXCEPT
TO THE EAST.  A LITTLE MORE STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST BEFORE
MADELINE REACHES THE COAST.

MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE NORTHWARD...010/5.  THE 06Z RUN OF THE
NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS MADELINE NEAR THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A
MID-LEVEL RIDGE WITH A TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. DURING THE
NEXT 2-3 DAYS.  TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS SOME SPREAD BUT...BASED
ON THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN...THE MOST REASONABLE SOLUTION SEEMS TO BE A
GENERALLY NORTHWARD MOTION WITH A GRADUAL NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD BEND
NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE AND THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE MODEL NHC91.

SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB...SAB AND AFGW SUGGEST THAT MADELINE
HAS SLOWED DOWN AND IS NOW DRIFTING NORTHWARD.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 010/2 KNOTS.  THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS CONTINUE TO
SHOW SOME SCATTER.  THE LEFT-MOST OF THE GUIDANCE IS THE AVIATION
WHICH BRINGS MADELINE WEST THEN NORTHWEST TOWARDS BAJA WHILE THE
GFDL AND CLIPER KEEP THE SYSTEM MOVING ON A SLOW GENERAL NORTHERLY
HEADING. AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THIS SEEM LIKE THE MOST PLAUSIBLE
SOLUTION GIVEN THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
GOES ALONG WITH SLOW NORTH TRACK WITH A BEND BACK TOWARD THE NORTH-
NORTHEAST AFTER 36 HOURS.  THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.
 
ALTHOUGH THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS BECOME MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED
AROUND MADELINE THE COLDEST TOPS...-80 DEG C...REMAIN PRIMARILY
OVER THE SOUTHERN SEMICIRCLE.  THE OUTFLOW IS WELL-ESTABLISHED
OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE WHILE RESTRICTED OVER THE EAST.
SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST BEFORE MADELINE REACHES

THE U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT JUST SENT
A VORTEX MESSAGE BACK FROM ITS PENETRATION OF MADELINE.  THE MAXIMUM
FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND WAS 76 KNOTS WITH A 73 KNOT SURFACE WIND AND A
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 982 MB RECORDED BY A GPS DROPSONDE.  
THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST SUBJECTIVE-BASED DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY
WILL BE INCREASED TO 75 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY. NO SIGNIFICANT 
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS.    

THE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE REPORTED A CLOSED 15 NMI EYE WHILE
SATELLITE DATA IS NOT AS CONCLUSIVE.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE
IS 360/04 KNOTS. THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST MOVES MADELINE ON 
A SLOW NORTHWARD COURSE THROUGH 48 HOURS WITH A BEND TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST THEREAFTER. THIS SEEMS LIKE THE MOST PLAUSIBLE
SOLUTION GIVEN THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN.  THE OFFICIAL NHC TRACK IS

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT MON OCT 19 1998

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE SO NO LARGE CHANGES ARE MADE TO
THE MOTION ESTIMATE...SLOWLY NORTHWARD.   THE STEERING OF MADELINE
DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE ROLES OF A MID- TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NEAR
THE BAJA PENINSULA AND THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WHICH EXTENDS WESTWARD
TO THE VICINITY OF THE HURRICANE.  IF THE FORMER FEATURE
DOMINATES...THEN MADELINE WOULD ACCELERATED NORTH TO NORTHEASTWARD. 
IF THE LATTER IS MORE INFLUENTIAL...THEN A SLOWER NORTH TO
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION COULD DEVELOP.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK
FORECAST IS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE.  THIS IS A
COMPROMISE BETWEEN A NORTH TO NORTHEASTWARD OPTION AS SHOWN BY SOME
OF THE MODELS SUCH AS THE MEDIUM BAM AND THE BAROTROPIC..AND A NORTH
TO NORTHWESTWARD TRACK AS SHOWN BY NOGAPS AND THE GFDL MODEL.  

THE SYSTEM DOES NOT LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE AT THE MOMENT WITH ONLY A
SMALL AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION AND EVIDENCE OF SOUTHERLY SHEARING. 
CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS KEPT AT 75 KNOTS. VISIBLE SATELLITE
PICTURES LATER TODAY SHOULD PROVIDE A BETTER INTENSITY ESTIMATE.  NO
CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED BEFORE LANDFALL.

8 AM PDT MON OCT 19 1998
 
LOCATING THE CIRCULATION CENTER OF MADELINE IS A DIFFICULT TASK
WITH INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED
WITH THE HURRICANE HAS DIMINISHED AND INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE
CENTER IS PARTIALLY EXPOSED AS A RESULT OF SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY
VERTICAL WIND SHEAR...PER IMAGERY AND CIMSS ANALYSES.  DVORAK
CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 4.0 FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB...
AND ARE THE BASIS FOR REDUCING THE WINDS TO 65 KNOTS.  THIS
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD UNTIL LANDFALL FOR NOW...FORECAST IN ABOUT
24 HOURS...UNTIL A DEFINITIVE TREND CAN BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH
VISIBLE IMAGERY.  

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 360/04 KNOTS. THE SATELLITE
FIXES SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER MAY BE SLIGHTLY WEST OF THE PREVIOUS
TRACK.  THUS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS BEEN ADJUSTED A BIT
TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAME
GENERAL DIRECTION AND SPEED OF MOTION.  THERE STILL IS UNCERTAINLY
SURROUNDING WHICH FEATURE WILL DOMINATE THE STEERING OF MADELINE...
I.E. THE MID- TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NEAR THE BAJA PENINSULA OR THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE EXTENDING WESTWARD TO THE VICINITY OF THE
HURRICANE.  THE WESTWARD POSITION ADJUSTMENT SEEMS TO SUPPORT THE 
LATTER FEATURE AS THE MORE INFLUENTIAL...WITH A SLOWER NORTH TO
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION.

MADELINE HAS COLLAPSED...NOW DEVOID OF DEEP CONVECTION AND HENCE
UNCLASSIFIABLE VIA THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE.  THE WEAKENING IS DUE 
IN LARGE PART TO SOUTHERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR.  THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION IS NOW COMPLETELY EXPOSED.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
REDUCED TO 35 KNOTS...A MINIMUM TROPICAL STORM.  THE CYCLONE WILL
LIKELY BE DOWNGRADED TO A DEPRESSION ON THE NEXT ADVISORY UNLESS
THERE IS A STRONG RESURGENCE OF CONVECTION. THIS TIME YESTERDAY WE
HAD A 980 MB HURRICANE WITH 73 KT SURFACE WINDS.  THIS SYSTEM SHOWS
ONCE AGAIN THE DIFFICULTY IN INTENSITY FORECASTING...IN THIS CASE
RAPID WEAKENING.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 310/8 KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST 
BRINGS THE SYSTEM ON A NORTHWEST THEN NORTH HEADING THROUGH 72
HOURS...IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SHALLOW BAMD.  THIS TRACK BRINGS
WHAT/S LEFT OF MADELINE INLAND BY 48 HOURS...IF IT SURVIVES THAT
LONG.
