TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE-E DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT FRI JUN 18 1999
 
THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE LOCATED SOUTH-SOUTHEAST OF ACAPULCO HAS
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE NIGHT...AS A CONVECTIVE BAND WITH
TOPS TO -85C FORMS NEAR AND WEST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER. LATEST
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 2.0. THUS...
ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE-E. 

SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES ARE SOUTH AND WEST OF THE PREVIOUS
FIXES...SO THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN. THE BEST ESTIMATE IS
270/07. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE CENTERED NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION OVER MEXICO. THE AVN
AND NOGAPS MODELS SUGGEST THIS WILL PERSIST...AND PERHAPS EVEN DRIFT
WEST...THROUGH THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THIS SHOULD KEEP THE SYSTEM ON A
WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE AGREES WITH
THIS...ALTHOUGH THE MODELS START A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK A LITTLE TOO
SOON IF THE CURRENT MOTION IS CORRECT. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE LBAR.

THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING MODERATE EASTERLY UPPER
LEVEL SHEAR. THE AVN AND NOGAPS INDICATE THIS SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH
THE NEXT THREE DAYS. SHIPS AND SHIFOR BOTH BRING THE CYCLONE TO
HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 48 TO 72 HOURS...SHIPS DOING SO DESPITE
PERSISTENT 20 TO 25 KT SHEAR VALUES. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR
STRENGTHENING...BUT NOT AS FAST AS SHIPS AND SHIFOR. IT IS NOTABLE
THAT THE 00Z GFDL RUN DISSIPATES THE DEPRESSION AT 36 HOURS.

THE CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO REMAIN FAR ENOUGH OFFSHORE SO THAT
TROPICAL STORM WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE NOT NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.
HOWEVER...BANDS OF HEAVY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COULD MOVE ONTO
THE MEXICAN COAST FROM ACAPULCO EASTWARD...POSSIBLY PRODUCING FLASH
FLOODING AND MUDSLIDES.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE-E DISCUSSION NUMBER   2
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT FRI JUN 18 1999
 
THE CENTER OF THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE
THIS MORNING.  SATELLITE ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE  60 MILES
APART...SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 13 AND 14 NORTH...WHILE SSMI IMAGERY FROM
NRL/MONTEREY SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER MAY BE CLOSER TO 12 DEGREES
NORTH.  UNTIL WE HAVE MORE VISIBLE IMAGERY TODAY WE ARE GUIDED BY
CONTINUITY FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
285/9.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  ALTHOUGH MODEL GUIDANCE DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT THE
DEPRESSION WILL MAKE LANDFALL...BANDS OF HEAVY RAIN AND SQUALLS MAY
AFFECT COASTAL SECTIONS OF SOUTHWEST MEXICO FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.

DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS ARE 2.5 FROM TAFB AND SAB...35 KT...WHILE AIR
FORCE WEATHER AGENCY HAS 1.5.  OFFICIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 30 KT
FOR THIS PACKAGE...HOWEVER...SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE
DEPRESSION IS BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND IS EXPECTED TO REACH
TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH LATER TODAY.  THERE IS SOME EASTERLY
SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM BUT IT APPEARS TO BE RELAXING SOMEWHAT OVER
THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL BRINGS THE TD TO
65 KT IN 72 HOURS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT FRI JUN 18 1999
 
EASTERLY SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE HAS RELAXED TODAY...WITH OUTFLOW
DEVELOPING IN ALL BUT THE EASTERN QUADRANT.  SATELLITE IMAGERY AND
SSM/I WINDS SPEED INFORMATION INDICATE THAT THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION
HAS STRENGTHENED AND IS NOW TROPICAL STORM ADRIAN.  

THE CENTER OF ADRIAN HAS BEEN OBSCURED BY DENSE OVERCAST ALL
DAY...BUT SSM/I IMAGERY AND A FIX FROM THE AIR FORCE WEATHER AGENCY
ARE SHOWING THAT THE CENTER HAS BEEN REORGANIZING NORTH OF OUR
PREVIOUS ESTIMATES.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS STILL SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN
BUT OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS 290/10.  THE AVN MODEL INITIAL ANALYSIS HAS
A CYCLONIC CIRCULATION TO THE WEST OF ADRIAN WHICH PROBABLY DOES NOT
EXIST.  THE GFDL MODEL...WHICH TAKES THE STORM VERY CLOSE TO THE
MEXICAN COAST...MAY BE REACTING TO THIS VORTEX.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE
IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD AND THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS A WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK THROUGH 48
HOURS.  ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT ADRIAN WILL MAKE
LANDFALL...BANDS OF HEAVY RAIN AND SQUALLS MAY AFFECT COASTAL
SECTIONS OF SOUTHWEST MEXICO FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.
 
THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST BRING ADRIAN TO HURRICANE STRENGTH
IN 48 HOURS...IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL.

TROPICAL STORM ADRIAN DISCUSSION NUMBER   4
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT FRI JUN 18 1999
 
THE CENTER IS NOT WELL DEFINED TONIGHT WITH SAB AND TAFB POSITION
ESTIMATES BEING ABOUT 50 NMI APART.  USING THE TAFB POSITION GIVES
AN INITIAL MOTION OF 290/11 WHILE THE SAB POSITION GIVES 290/15.
THE TAFB POSITION AND 290/11 IS THE OFFICIAL CHOICE ALTHOUGH THIS IS
ARBITRARY.  THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL CONTINUES TO SHOW A BOGUS LOW
JUST WEST OF THE STORM.  THIS APPEARS TO BE CAUSING THE GFDL MODEL
TO MOVE THE STORM NORTHWESTWARD WHILE ALL OF THE OTHER GUIDANCE
SHOWS A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD MOTION.  SINCE THE AVIATION MODEL
SHOWS A RIDGE PERSISTING TO THE NORTH OF THE STORM...THE GFDL
SOLUTION IS REJECTED AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY FOLLOWING THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE.  THIS
KEEPS THE TRACK OFFSHORE OF THE COAST OF MEXICO.
 
ALTHOUGH DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 3.0 FROM TAFB AND 3.5 FROM
SAB...THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS WARMED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE PAST
FEW HOURS AND WHAT WAS A LARGE CDO FEATURE HAS FRAGMENTED INTO
A RATHER CHAOTIC CONVECTIVE PATTERN.  HOWEVER A SMALL CDO FEATURE
APPEARS TO BE GROWING AGAIN DURING THE LAST HOUR OR SO.  THEREFORE
THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO ONLY 45 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE
FORECAST IS FOR INTENSIFICATION TO 75 KNOTS IN 36 HOURS FOLLOWED BY
SLIGHT WEAKENING AS ADRIAN APPROACHES COOLER WATER.
 
SOME OUTER BANDS ARE PRODUCING DEEP CONVECTION AND PRESUMABLY HEAVY
RAINFALL OVER PORTIONS OF MEXICO AND THIS COULD CONTINUE FOR THE
NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO.

INFRARED AND FIRST VISIBLE IMAGERY INDICATE THAT THE TRACK REMAINS
ON A 290 DEGREE HEADING AT THE SLIGHTLY FASTER SPEED OF 14 KNOTS. 
THERE ARE NO IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THE TRACK GUIDANCE.  ALL BUT THE
GFDL SHOW A MOTION BETWEEN NORTHWEST AND WEST THROUGH 72
HOURS...EXCEPT THE BAM MODELS WHICH ACQUIRE A SOUTHWARD COMPONENT
AFTER 36 TO 48 HOURS.  THE GFDL CONTINUES TO TURN THE STORM
NORTHWARD.  THE 06Z AVIATION MODEL AGAIN HAS A RIDGE PERSISTING TO
THE NORTH OF THE STORM AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS AN UPDATE
OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY SHOWING A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION THROUGH
72 HOURS.

THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DEEP CONVECTION ALTHOUGH IT IS A BIT SPREAD
OUT AND NOT TOO SYMMETRIC.  HOWEVER THE FIRST VISIBLE IMAGES SHOWS A
NICE CDO FEATURE AND A HINT OF AN EYE-TYPE FEATURE WHICH COULD BE MY
IMAGINATION.  IN ANY CASE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 3.5 T
NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB AND KGWC AND THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASE TO
55 KNOTS.  VERTICAL WIND SHEAR DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A LIMITING
FACTOR...BASED ON THE SHIPS MODEL AND ON CIMSS SATELLITE DERIVED
WINDS.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST TAKES THE WIND SPEED TO 80
KNOTS IN 36 HOURS...A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE SHIPS AND SHIFOR
MODELS.

AGAIN...THERE IS DEEP CONVECTION AND HEAVY RAINFALL ALONG THE COAST
OF MEXICO WHICH SHOULD MOVE OFFSHORE IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS THE
STORM CONTINUES MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/13.  THERE IS NOT MUCH CHANGE IN
THE TRACK GUIDANCE BASED ON THE 12Z GLOBAL MODEL RUNS AS COMPARED TO
THE PREVIOUS RUN...EXCEPT THAT THE GFDL MODEL HAS BACKED OFF
SLIGHTLY ON ITS NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.  THEREFORE THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO AND AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY SHOWING A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION WITH SLIGHT
DECELERATION.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE UKMET MODEL.

DVORAK ESTIMATES ARE 4.0 AND 3.5 T NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB
RESPECTIVELY.  THERE IS A SHIP FNCM LOCATED 35 NMI NORTHWEST OF THE
CENTER AT 18Z AND MOVING SOUTHWARD.  IT REPORTED ONLY 27 KNOTS AND 9
FT SEAS.  IT LOOKS LIKE THIS SHIP IS TRYING TO PENETRATE THE CENTER
OF THE STORM.  THIS SHIP IS A REASON FOR KEEPING ADRIAN JUST BELOW
HURRICANE INTENSITY WITH 60 KNOTS FOR THE INITIAL WIND SPEED.  THE
FORECAST IS FOR STRENGTHENING TO 80 KNOTS IN 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY
WEAKENING WHEN COLD SSTS ARE ENCOUNTERED.

THE WIND AND SEAS RADII IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT ARE REDUCED BASED
ON THE ABOVE MENTIONED SHIP REPORT.

THE DEEP CONVECTION IS STILL OVER PORTIONS OF THE COAST OF MEXICO
BUT SHOULD BE MOVING OFFSHORE IN THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT SAT JUN 19 1999

ADRIAN HAS BECOME THE FIRST HURRICANE OF THE 1999 EASTERN NORTH
PACIFIC HURRICANE SEASON...BASED ON SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM ALL AGENCIES.  ADRIAN HAS DEVELOPED AN IRREGULAR CENTRAL DENSE
OVERCAST AND A FEW BANDING FEATURES WHILE THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW
CONTINUES TO BE FAIR.  SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS POSSIBLE
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS BUT THEREAFTER...THE HURRICANE WILL BE
MOVING OVER COOLER THAN NORMAL WATERS AND WITHIN AN AREA OF LARGE
SCALE SUBSIDENCE AS INDICATED BY WATER VAPOR IMAGES.  A GRADUAL
WEAKENING SHOULD THEN BEGIN. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH SHIFOR AND
SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODELS.  

INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 290/13 AND THIS TRACK IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE
AS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE MOVES AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL
RIDGE CENTERED OVER MEXICO.  MOST OF THE MODELS AGREE ON A GENERAL
WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...MODELS
DIVERGE INDICATING SLOW...FAST...NORTHWEST... AND SOUTHWEST TRACKS.
THE MODELS WHICH DEPEND ON THE MEAN FLOW EXTRACTED FROM THE AVN ARE
LESS RELIABLE AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THE AVN IS INITIALIZING A STRONG-
NON EXISTENT VORTEX TO THE SOUTHWEST OF ADRIAN.  CONSEQUENTLY...A
NON-REALISTIC STEERING FLOW TOWARD THE WEST AND WEST-SOUTHWEST IS
PRODUCED.  HOWEVER...THIS LEFT BIAS IS LESS PRONOUNCED TONIGHT THAN
IN PREVIOUS RUNS.      

SHIP FNCM HAS CROSSED THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE ADRIAN DURING THE
DAY.  LATEST OBSERVATION INDICATED WEST WINDS OF 35 KNOTS AND RISING
PRESSURE. WE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE LOG FROM THAT SHIP TO DOCUMENT
ITS PATH NEAR ADRIAN.

AND THE CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED.  THE CYCLONE IS NOT AS SYMMETRICAL
AS IT WAS EARLIER WITH CURRENT GOES-10 SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTING
THAT ADRIAN IS EXPERIENCING SOUTHEASTERLY SHEAR...IN AGREEMENT WITH
ANALYSIS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES...CIMSS. SST DATA SHOWS THAT ADRIAN
IS VERY NEAR THE 25C ISOTHERM.  THUS...ADRIAN HAS LIKELY PEAKED AND
IS BEGINNING TO WEAKEN.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 80 KT
FOR THIS ADVISORY...IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH TAFB AND SAB DVORAK
ESTIMATES.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A GRADUAL WEAKENING
TREND THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIDO AS ADRIAN ENCOUNTERS
PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATERS...NEAR 21-22C BY 72 HOURS.

SATELLITE-BASED POSITION ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT ADRIAN HAS BEEN
MOVING ON A MORE WESTERLY COURSE AND HAS SLOWED SOMEWHAT OVER THE
LAST 6 HOURS.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 280/8 KT.  THE
MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
STEER IT ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL 
SEVERAL DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INITIAL MOTION...AND IS IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH P91E AND CLIPER.   

THE 00Z OBSERVATION FROM SOCORRO ISLAND...18.7N/110.9W...SHOW THAT
THE WINDS ARE NORTH AT 10 KT WITH THE CENTER ABOUT 50 NM TO THE
SOUTHEAST.  BASED ON THIS DATA...THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED
IN THE WESTERN QUADRANTS.

2 AM PDT TUE JUN 22 1999

ADRIAN HAS BEEN DEVOID OF DEEP CONVECTION FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS OR
MORE. IT IS BASICALLY A TIGHT SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS MOVING OVER COOL
WATERS AND TOWARD A LARGE SCALE DRY AND STABLE ENVIRONMENT AS SEEN
ON WATER VAPOR IMAGES.  DVORAK T-NUMBERS CONTINUE TO DECREASE AND
ARE NOT EVEN LOWER BECAUSE OF CONTINUITY CONSTRAINTS. IT IS KNOWN
THAT THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR EASTERN PACIFIC
SWIRLS.  LATEST HIGH RESOLUTION CLOUD MOTION VECTORS FROM THE
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN INDICATE THAT WINDS ARE ABOUT 20 KNOTS WITH
A FEW SPOTS OF 30 KNOTS. WINDS AT THE SURFACE ARE PROBABLY WEAKER
SINCE THE ENVIRONMENT IS STABLE.  ADRIAN HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A
TROPICAL DEPRESSION STATUS AT THIS TIME.

THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE MOVING SLOWLY WESTWARD
STEERED BY THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW...AS SUGGESTED BY BAM SHALLOW...UNTIL
DISSIPATION IN A DAY OR SO.  HOWEVER...THESE SWIRLS COULD LAST FOR
DAYS WITH NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER ASSOCIATED.

THE STORM EMBEDDED IN DEEP EASTERLIES FOR 72 HOURS AND ALL OF THE
GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A MOSTLY WESTWARD MOTION...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.

THERE IS MORE DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER THIS AFTERNOON AND THE
TAFB INTENSITY NUMBER INCREASED TO 3.5 WHILE SAB AND KGWC REMAINED
AT 3.0.  THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 50 KNOTS AND FURTHER
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST SIMILAR TO THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL.
  
LATEST U.S. NAVY FNMOC SCATTEROMETER DATA SHOW A 41 KNOT WIND SPEED
SOME 150 N MI NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER AND 33 KNOTS ABOUT 80 N MI
SOUTHWEST OF CENTER.  THE WIND SPEED RADII ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
BEATRIZ IS GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED.  THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE HAS DEVELOPED A CIRCULAR AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION WITH
BANDING FEATURES AND THE OUTFLOW REMAINS WELL ESTABLISHED. BEATRIZ
IS VERY NEAR HURRICANE STRENGTH AND IN FACT...THE LATEST DVORAK
T-NUMBER FROM TAFB INDICATES SO.  HOWEVER...SAB AND KGWC NUMBERS ARE
STILL 3.5 OR JUST BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH.  NO SURPRISE IF AN EYE
WILL BECOME VISIBLE AT ANY TIME.  BOTH SHIPS AND SHIFOR STRENGTHEN
BEATRIZ FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL WEAKENING
THEREAFTER...PROBABLY DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF COOLER SST AHEAD.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS BEATRIZ TO 75 KNOTS IN 24 TO 36 HOURS AND
THEN A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS INDICATED.     

BEATRIZ IS MOVING WESTWARD ABOUT 12 KNOTS EMBEDDED WITHIN A WELL
ESTABLISHED DEEP LAYER MEAN EASTERLY FLOW WHICH IS FORECAST TO
PERSIST.  THEREFORE...BEATRIZ SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE SAME GENERAL
TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS.  MOST OF THE MODELS AGREE ON THIS GENERAL
WESTWARD MOTION.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN THE CLOUD PATTERN OF BEATRIZ
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE CYCLONE APPEARS TO BE NEAR THE
THRESHOLD OF HURRICANE STRENGTH BUT THE CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST IS
RATHER RAGGED.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS SOMEWHAT INHIBITED OVER THE
NORTHEAST SEMICIRCLE...BUT OTHERWISE THE CLOUD FEATURES ARE WELL
ORGANIZED.  SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE ADEQUATE FOR STRENGTHENING
AS WELL.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ONE AND
SHOWS BEATRIZ BECOMING A HURRICANE LATER TODAY.  LATER IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD...MORE STABLE AIR AND DECREASING OCEAN TEMPERATURES
ARE LIKELY TO BRING ABOUT GRADUAL WEAKENING.

THE STORM CONTINUES WESTWARD AT AROUND 12 KNOTS AND THE LATEST NCEP
GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A CONTINUED WESTWARD STEERING DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  A MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE...SEEN IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY NEAR 25N 132W...COULD INDUCE A MORE NORTHWESTWARD TRACK BUT
THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW THIS FEATURE PROPAGATING SWIFTLY WESTWARD...
STAYING WELL AHEAD OF BEATRIZ.

EMBEDDED IN -60 TO -70C CLOUD TOPS.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW APPEARS
STRONG EVERYWHERE EXCEPT TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.  SOME
ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. THE CURRENT NHC
INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. 
LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...SLOW WEAKENING IS EXPECTED DUE TO

MOTION IS WESTWARD NEAR 10 KNOTS.  DEEP-LAYER MEAN STEERING FORECAST
BY THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL IS WESTWARD OR SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WESTWARD
FOR THE NEXT 2-3 DAYS.  THE GFDL MODEL SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHWEST IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...
PRESUMABLY DUE TO A WEAKNESS IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE ALONG
125W/130W.  HOWEVER THIS WEAKNESS MAY BE TOO FAR NORTH TO HAVE MUCH
IMPACT ON THE STEERING.

LATEST ERS-2 SCATTEROMETER DATA FROM NAVY FLEET NUMERICAL SHOW THAT

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SINCE 10Z INDICATES THAT THE EYE OF
BEATRIZ HAS BECOME A LITTLE LESS DISTINCT...AND THE SURROUNDING DEEP
CONVECTION HAS BECOME ASYMMETRIC. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS IS DUE
TO A CONCENTRIC EYEWALL CYCLE OR A PEAKING OF THE CYCLONE DUE TO
INTERACTION WITH COLDER WATER. DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE T5.5

SLIGHTLY CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH THROUGH 36 HOURS FOLLOWED BY GRADUAL WEAKENING DUE TO
COLDER WATER AND POSSIBLE SHEAR. ANY MOTION NORTH OF THE CURRENT
FORECAST TRACK WOULD LIKELY CAUSE A FASTER WEAKENING OVER COLDER
WATER.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/10. TRACK FORECAST GUIDANCE IS SCATTERED
AROUND A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...WITH THE BAMS...BAMM...AND
P91E MORE TO THE WEST AND THE NOGAPS AND GFDL OFF TO THE NORTHWEST.
THE 06Z GFDL IS TO THE RIGHT OF ALL OTHER GUIDANCE...CALLING FOR A

THE STRONG RIDGE SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND VARIOUS MODEL
HEIGHT FIELDS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR...BUT SLIGHTLY NORTH

A MOTION OF 290/10. THE REASON FOR THE TURN IS NOT OBVIOUS.
HOWEVER... AN UPPER LEVEL LOW APPARENT IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY NEAR
22N119W MAY BE WEAKENING THE RIDGE NORTH OF BEATRIZ. THE 06Z
AVIATION MODEL DEVELOPS A ELONGATED CYCLONIC VORTEX FROM BEATRIZ AND
THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE NEAR THE MEXICAN COAST. THIS CAUSES THE
MODEL TO MOVE THE STORM IN A HALF-LOOP...WHICH APPEARS UNLIKELY
GIVEN THE CURRENT TRENDS. THE BAM MODELS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE
VORTEX...TURNING BEATRIZ WEST-SOUTHWEST AFTER 36 HOURS. THE NOGAPS
AND GDFL KEEP CALLING FOR A NORTHWEST TRACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE
OTHER GUIDANCE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS BEATRIZ ALONG A

TROUGH NEAR THE U.S. WEST COAST WEAKENS THE RIDGE. THIS IS IN
REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE LBAR AND UKMET...AND IS SHIFTED TO THE

THE MORE NORTHERLY TRACK SHOULD BRING BEATRIZ TO COLDER WATER MORE
QUICKLY THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW A FASTER

BEATRIZ REMAINS WELL-ORGANIZED WITH A WELL-DEFINED 20 N MI DIAMETER
EYE. HOWEVER...THE TOPS ARE WARMING AND DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES SUGGEST WEAKENING IS BEGINNING. THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
SET TO 100 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/9. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN EITHER THE
SYNOPTIC PATTERN OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE SINCE THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
THE AVIATION MODEL IS STILL DEVELOPING A DUBIOUS LOOKING BROAD
VORTEX THAT ENVELOPES BOTH BEATRIZ AND THE DISTURBANCE NEAR THE
MEXICAN COAST. THIS MAKES THE AVN AND THE BAM MODEL TRACK SUSPECT.  
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS THE CURRENT WEST-NORTHWESTWARD
TRACK...WITH SOME SLOWING AFTER 36 HOURS AS A TROUGH NEAR THE U.S.
WEST COAST WEAKENS THE RIDGE. THIS IS AGAIN IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT
WITH THE LBAR AND UKMET...AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.
 
THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST...WHICH
CALLS FOR BEATRIZ TO WEAKEN BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH BETWEEN 48 AND
72 HOURS.

BEATRIZ HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN STRUCTURE OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS. 
DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS ARE A CONSENSUS 5.5...WITH LOWER DATA T
NUMBERS...BUT THE OBJECTIVE T NUMBERS HAVE COME UP A BIT THIS
EVENING.  AS A RESULT...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 100 KT. 
WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN SHORTLY AS SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES DROP IN
THE PATH OF THE HURRICANE.
 
BEATRIZ HAS TURNED A BIT MORE TO THE NORTH AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS
NOW 295/10.  HIGH-DENSITY WINDS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN
SHOW THAT THE HURRICANE IS MOVING ROUGHLY WITH THE SURROUNDING MID-
LEVEL FLOW...WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE SOME CONTRIBUTION FROM THE
OUTFLOW OF THE DISTURBANCE OFF THE MEXICAN COAST.  ALL MODEL
GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE MORE NORTHWARD TREND IS TEMPORARY...WITH
A RIDGE REMAINING TO THE NORTHWEST OF BEATRIZ.  AS THE HURRICANE
WEAKENS OVER COOLER WATER...STEERING WILL PRESUMABLY BE DETERMINED
BY A SHALLOWER LAYER FLOW.  THIS REASONING WOULD ALSO SUGGEST A
RETURN TO A MORE WESTERLY TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY
TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE OUT TO 36 HOURS...AND TO THE
LEFT AND FASTER BEYOND THAT.

THE EYE OF BEATRIZ IS BECOMING RAGGED AND THE SURROUNDING CLOUD TOPS
ARE WARMING.  AS THE HURRICANE NEARS THE 25 DEG C SST ISOTHERM...IT
APPEARS TO BE GRADUALLY WEAKENING.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES AT
06Z RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 5.5...I.E. 90 TO 102 KNOTS.  CURRENT
INTENSITY IS SET AT 95 KNOTS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS
CONTINUED WEAKENING WITH A MORE RAPID DECLINE NEAR THE END OF THE
PERIOD...BY WHICH TIME IT IS EXPECTED THAT BEATRIZ WILL BE OVER 23
DEG C WATERS.

MOTION CONTINUES 295/10.  THE SLIGHT RIGHTWARD TURN OVER THE PAST 12
HOURS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF BEATRIZ...AS SUGGESTED BY THE NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL AND HINTED AT IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST IS ESSENTIALLY AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND
VERY CLOSE TO THE STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE.  AS THE SYSTEM
WEAKENS...IT SHOULD BE STEERED MORE BY THE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC

BEATRIZ HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN ORGANIZATION OVER THE PAST SIX

FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA. THE CURRENT INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY
REMAINS AT 95 KT. BEATRIZ SHOULD BEGIN A FASTER WEAKENING IN THE

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/10. THE AVIATION MODEL IS STILL HAVING
PROBLEMS WITH BEATRIZ...TROPICAL DEPRESSION THREE-E...AND ONE OR TWO

FAIRLY DEEP CONVECTION...PRIMARILY OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN SEMICIRCLE
OF THE HURRICANE.  BEATRIZ HAS BEEN WEAKENING VERY SLOWLY UP TO THIS
POINT...BUT IT IS HEADED FOR SEA SURFACE TEMPS NEAR 23 DEG C IN A
DAY OR SO.  THEREFORE A MORE RAPID DEGENERATION OF THE SYSTEM IS
LIKELY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE
SAME AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/9.  THE CURRENT NHC TRACK FORECAST IS ONLY
SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE...NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.  A
GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE WEST IS LIKELY AS THE WEAKENING CYCLONE

BASED ON THE AVIATION MODEL SUGGESTS A WESTWARD TRACK. HOWEVER...
THIS GUIDANCE IS SOMEWHAT SUSPECT DUE TO THE MODEL DEVELOPING

THE NOGAPS SHOW AN UNUSUALLY STRONG TROUGH DIGGING ALONG THE U.S.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION THREE-E DISCUSSION NUMBER   3
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT WED JUL 14 1999

THE CENTER OF THE DEPRESSION IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE EVEN WITH
VISIBLE IMAGERY...AS SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB/SAB ARE 120 NM FROM
THOSE OF AFWA. THE INITIAL POSITION IS BASED ON THE TAFB FIX AND A
REPORT FROM SHIP VRUM4...WHICH CALL FOR SOME RE-LOCATION OF THE
CENTER AND AN ESTIMATED INITIAL MOTION OF 270/16. THE SYSTEM COULD
BE MOVING WEST-SOUTHWEST...BUT THE POSITION UNCERTAINTY MAKES IT
UNWISE TO CHANGE THE MOTION THAT MUCH IN THIS PACKAGE.

NHC HURRICANE TRACK GUIDANCE BASED ON THE AVIATION MODEL MOVES THE
CYCLONE WEST-SOUTHWEST. WHILE THIS MAY BE OCCURRING NOW...THIS
GUIDANCE APPEARS TO BE INFLUENCED BY A SPURIOUS LOOKING VORTEX THE
AVIATION DEVELOPS SOUTHEAST OF THREE-E. THE OFFICAL FORECAST CALLS
FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH THE PERIOD...IN BEST AGREEMENT
WITH THE LBAR. SOME GRADUAL DECREASE IN FORWARD MOTION SHOULD OCCUR
AS THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH WEAKENS.

A FORECAST OF STRENGTHENING HAS ITS PROS AND CONS. ON THE CON
SIDE...THE CONVECTION IS CURRENTLY VERY DISORGANIZED. ALSO...THE
UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE SEEN EARLIER NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION HAS
WEAKENED...ALLOWING SOME NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR. ON THE PRO SIDE... THE
AVIATION AND NOGAPS SUGGEST THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS WILL BECOME MORE
FAVORABLE...AND THE MORE WESTWARD TRACK WILL KEEP THE CYCLONE OVER
WARMER WATER FOR A LONGER TIME. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR SLOW
STRENGTHENING THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION HAS LOST ALL ITS DEEP CONVECTION...AND IT IS
QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THERE IS ANY DEFINITE SURFACE CIRCULATION
REMAINING.  SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA
ARE AMAZINGLY CLOSE...CONSIDERING THE WAY THE SYSTEM LOOKS.  INITIAL
MOTION IS 270/16...UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  BASED ON
25 KT WINDS FROM SOCORRO ISLAND EARLIER IN THE DAY THE INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 30 KT.
 
THE DEPRESSION IS EMBEDDED IN A LARGE SCALE CYCLONIC ENVIRONMENT...
FROM WHICH THE AVIATION MODEL DEVELOPS AN ADDITIONAL VORTEX THAT
TURNS THE DEPRESSION TO THE SOUTHWEST.  THE OFFICAL FORECAST CALLS
FOR WESTWARD MOTION AT A SOMEWHAT REDUCED SPEED THROUGH THE
PERIOD...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  GIVEN THE LACK OF
CONVECTION AND ORGANIZATION...DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEPRESSION TO A
TROPICAL STORM SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS TIME.

SATELLITE DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS RANGE FROM T1.5...25 KT FROM AFWA

OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  A SHIP...
ELWB8...LOCATED ABOUT 125 NM NORTHWEST OF THE CENTER REPORTED WINDS
OF ONLY 9 KT.

OUTFLOW IS APPARENT ONLY TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY MODEL STRENGTHENS THE DEPRESSION ONLY SLOWLY AND LEVELS
OFF AT ABOUT 40 KT.  GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE SYSTEM AND THE COMPETING
FLOW AROUND THE ITCZ...ONLY MODEST INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST... 
WITH THE DEPRESSION REACHING STORM STRENGTH IN 24 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/15.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND HIGH-DENSITY
CLOUD MOTION VECTORS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN/CIMSS SHOW A
LARGE MID-LATITUDE TROUGH TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST OF THE DEPRESSION. 
HOWEVER...ALL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS ENOUGH RIDGING TO THE

LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 35...35...AND 30 KT FROM

DEPRESSION FOUR-E IS AT OR NEAR TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH. HOWEVER...
THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION IS ELONGATED WEST-NORTHWEST TO EAST-
SOUTHEAST AND...UNLESS THERE IS A TIGHT CENTER HIDDEN UNDER THE
CONVECTION...LOOKS A LITTLE LESS IMPRESSIVE THAN YESTERDAY. IN VIEW
OF THE MIXED SIGNALS...THE CYCLONE WILL REMAIN A DEPRESSION FOR THIS
PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 275/14. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NORTHWEST
OF THE DEPRESSION IS WEAKENING AND LIFTING TO THE NORTHEAST. THIS IS
ALLOWING A DEEP LAYER RIDGE TO BUILD WESTWARD WITH THE SYSTEM. MOST
LARGE-SCALE AND NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE INDICATE A GENERAL WESTWARD
MOTION SOUTH OF THIS LARGE RIDGE. THE OUTLIERS ARE THE GFDL AND
UKMET...WHICH TURN THE CYCLONE WEST-SOUTHWEST UNDER THE LARGE RIDGE.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A WESTWARD MOTION AND IS AN UPDATE
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

THE DEPRESSION REMAINS IN A LIGHT SHEAR ENVIRONMENT...WITH FAIR
OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE. THE AVIATION AND SHIPS MODELS
FORECAST THE LIGHT SHEAR TO CONTINUE...WHICH COULD ALLOW THIS SLOW-
DEVELOPING SYSTEM TO REACH TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR SLIGHT STRENGTHENING AND IS THE SAME AS THE

THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION CONTINUES WITH A POORLY DEFINED LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION.  IN FACT...IT IS LESS DEFINED THAN 24 HOURS AGO AND IT
SEEMS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE ITCZ WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LARGE SCALE
SATELLITE IMAGERY.  THE CONVECTION CONTINUES TO FLUCTUATE IN
INTENSITY AND IS NOW WEAKENING.  DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE EITHER STEADY
OR DECREASING INDICATING THAT THE CYCLONE REMAINS AS A TROPICAL
DEPRESSION.

THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE DEPRESSION IN 6 HOURS AND SHIPS MODEL MAKES
IT A TROPICAL STORM SOON.  ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT TREND IS WEAKENING
...I AM NOT ABOUT TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES USING IR IMAGES TO
THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST WHICH BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO STORM
STATUS.   

I DO NOT THINK THERE IS MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THIS WEAK SYSTEM

TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIVE-E DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT SUN JUL 25 1999

THE FIRST VISIBLE IMAGES OF THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE REVEAL A LOW-
LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER...NEAR THE NORTHWEST EDGE OF A CLUSTER OF
STRONG CONVECTION.  THIS HAD ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE 2-CHANNEL IR
COMBINATION IMAGERY OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THEREFORE...ALTHOUGH
THE CLOUD PATTERN IS NOT WELL ORGANIZED...THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE
CLASSIFIED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME.  A SHEARING
ENVIRONMENT DUE TO WEST-NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW SHOULD
INHIBIT SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING...BUT ONLY SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION
WOULD BRING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS.  THIS IS SHOWN IN
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...WHICH IS IN ROUGH AGREEMENT WITH THE
STATISTICAL INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME.  NEAR THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD...COOLER WATERS ARE EXPECTED TO CAUSE WEAKENING.

PREVIOUS CENTER FIXES ARE RATHER UNCERTAIN BUT THE BEST GUESS AT
INITIAL MOTION IS 295/14.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS A WEST-
NORTHWEST MOTION WITH A GRADUAL REDUCTION IN FORWARD SPEED.  THIS IS
IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL TRACK PREDICTION
MODELS AND MEDIUM- TO SHALLOW-LAYER STEERING.

THE SYSTEM IS A LITTLE LESS-ORGANIZED LOOKING THAN BEFORE. 
LOW-CLOUD LINES DEFINING THE CENTER OF CIRCULATION ARE NOT AS
DISTINCT AS THEY WERE SEVERAL HOURS AGO.  WEST-NORTHWESTERLY
VERTICAL SHEAR IS STILL EVIDENT...WITH THE ESTIMATED CENTER NEAR THE
NORTHWEST EDGE OF A PERSISTENT MASS OF STRONG CONVECTION.  THE
LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL
FLOW WILL BECOME MORE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  THUS ONLY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN STRENGTH IS ALLOWED
FOR...AS IN THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION IS SLIGHTLY SLOWER AND JUST A SMIDGEON TO THE LEFT OF
THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED
ACCORDINGLY.  THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO THE STATISTICAL GUIDANCE. 
DYNAMICAL TRACK MODELS ARE MORE TO THE NORTHWEST...LIKELY DUE TO A
500 MB MID-LATITUDE TROUGH SHOWN BY THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL NEAR 130W.
HOWEVER IT IS THOUGHT THAT THIS WEAK TROPICAL CYCLONE SHOULD RESPOND
MORE TO THE SHALLOW LAYER TRADEWIND FLOW...AND CONTINUE WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/13.  THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS
ABOUT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE SHOWING A CONTINUED MOSTLY
WEST-NORTHWEST OR NORTHWESTWARD MOTION WITH SOME SLOWING OF FORWARD
SPEED.  THE SLOWING DOWN IS IN RESPONSE TO AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
NEAR 130
DEGREES WEST LONGITUDE AS SEEN ON THE AVIATION MODEL.  SO THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND
SHIFTED A TAD TO THE RIGHT BASED ON THE INITIAL DIRECTION OF MOTION.

THE LOW LEVEL CLOUD LINES CONTINUE TO LOOK A LITTLE RAGGED ON
VISIBLE IMAGERY.  AN AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION PERSISTS TO THE
SOUTHEAST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER BUT THERE IS NO BANDING.  THE
INTENSITY AND INTENSITY FORECAST ARE KEPT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS MODEL INTENSITY

TROPICAL STORM CALVIN DISCUSSION NUMBER   4
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL

...CORRECTION TO CHANGE TROPICAL DEPRESSION CALVIN TO TROPICAL 
STORM AND FOR INITIAL POSITION...
 
THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIVE-E HAS NOT
IMPROVED MARKELY OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS OR SO.  THE SYSTEM REMAINS
IN A SHEARED STATE WITH THE CENTER LOCATED 0.5 TO 0.75 DEG FROM
THE EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM
BOTH TAFB AND SAB ARE 35 KT...AND TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIVE IS
UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM CALVIN.  THE 00Z AVN MODEL SUGGEST
THAT THE WESTERLY SHEAR WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.
THIS COUPLED WITH THE PROGRESSIVELY COOLER SST/S...NEAR 23C BY
36 HOURS...SHOULD PRECLUDE ANY SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS CALVIN A MINIMUM TROPICAL STORM FOR 24
HOURS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/12.  MOST OF THE DYNAMICAL MODEL
GUIDANCE SHOWS A WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 24 HOURS WITH A TURN
TO THE NORTHWEST...THEN NORTH-NORTHWEST BY 48 HOURS IN RESPONSE TO
THE MID-LEVEL TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY NEAR 30N 130W
DIGGING SOUTHWARD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK CALLS FOR A CONTINUED
WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION WITH SOME DECELERATION BY THE END OF THE
PERIOD...AND REPRESENTS A SLIGHT RIGHTWARD ADJUSTED TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE. HOWEVER...THIS TRACK IS STILL LEFT OF MOST OF THE DYNAMICAL
GUIDANCE SINCE THE CYCLONE SHOULD REMAIN WEAK...AND THUS BE STEERED
BY THE LOW-LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL FLOW.

FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE 35 KT...30 KT...AND 25 KT
RESPECTIVELY. CALVIN IS THUS DOWNGRADED TO A DEPRESSION ON THIS

THE TRACK FORECAST IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN EARLIER...AS
CALVIN MAY INTERACT WITH A TROPICAL DISTURBANCE TO ITS SOUTHWEST.
FORTUNATELY...THE CYCLONE IS LIKELY TO DISSIPATE BEFORE THE
INTERACTION IS TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST

305/7. SOME RE-LOCATION OF THE CENTER MAY BE NECESSARY WHEN VISIBLE
IMAGERY BECOMES AVAILABLE.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NORTH
OF THE DEPRESSION...WHICH APPEARS WELL-ANALYZED IN THE LARGE SCALE
MODELS. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE RESPONDS TO THE TROUGH BY SUGGESTING
A MORE NORTHERLY MOTION AND A FASTER FORWARD SPEED. EVEN THE SHALLOW
BAM MODEL FORECASTS THE DEPRESSION TO BE NORTH OF 24N IN 72 HOURS...
WHICH IS SURPRISING SINCE THE AVIATION MODEL KEEPS A STRONG LOW

THAT THE NOGAPS SUGGESTS A WESTWARD MOTION FOR THE NEXT THREE

TROPICAL DEPRESSION SEVEN-E HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS... WITH A CONVECTIVE BAND OVER THE SOUTHWEST SEMICIRCLE AND
SOMEWHAT DISORGANIZED CONVECTIVE BURSTS NEAR THE CENTER. SATELLITE
ESTIMATES ARE 35 AND 30 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON
THE CENTRAL CONVECTION...THE SYSTEM REMAINS A DEPRESSION ON THIS
PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/15. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH COVERING THE PACIFIC NORTH OF 20N BETWEEN
110W-130W...WITH AN UPPER LOW NEAR 16N113W. THE COMBINATION OF THESE
FEATURES SUGGESTS A NORTHWEST TRACK FOR THE DEPRESSION...WHICH IS
THE NOGAPS MODEL FORECAST. HOWEVER...THE AVN MODEL BUILDS A MID
LEVEL RIDGE WESTWARD WITH THE CYCLONE...WITH AVN-BASED GUIDANCE
AND THE GFDL INDICATING A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION. AN ADDITIONAL FLY
IN THE OINTMENT IS THE SLOW-MOVING TROPICAL LOW NEAR 12N 120W WHICH
IS GETTING BETTER ORGANIZED. THIS SYSTEM...WHICH WAS INITIALIZED TOO
FAR EAST BY BOTH THE AVN AND NOGAPS...COULD COMPLICATE THE STEERING
OF SEVEN-E IN TWO TO THREE DAYS. WITH THE LARGER THAN NORMAL
UNCERTAINTY...THE ONLY CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK WILL
BE A FASTER MOTION DURING THE FIRST 36 HOURS TO REFLECT THE INITIAL
MOTION.
 
SINCE THE CENTRAL CONVECTION IS CURRENTLY DISORGANIZED...THE
INTENSIFICATION DURING THE FIRST 12-24 HOURS IS LIKELY TO BE A
LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. THE REMAINDER OF THE
INTENSITY FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND THE SHIPS
MODEL. THE NOGAPS FORECASTS LESS SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE AFTER 24
HOURS THAN THE AVN...AND IF THIS VERIFIES THE SYSTEM COULD INTENSIFY
MORE QUICKLY THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.

SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS ARE 35 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND 25 KT
FROM AFWA.  DEEP CONVECTION PEAKED EARLIER THIS MORNING AND IS NOW
DECREASING...SO DEPRESSION STATUS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THIS
ADVISORY.  THE DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO REACH STORM STRENGTH WITHIN
24 HOURS AND HURRICANE STRENGTH WITHIN 72 HOURS...A FORECAST THAT IS
SLIGHTLY LESS AGGRESSIVE THAN THE SHIPS GUIDANCE.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/15.  THE NOGAPS MODEL MOVES THE DEPRESSION
IMMEDIATELY ON A NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...BUT THIS FORECAST IS
QUESTIONABLE BASED ON A VERY POOR INITIALIZATION OF THE DISTURBANCE
CURRENTLY NEAR 12N120W.  THE GFDL ALSO SUGGESTS A NORTHWESTERLY
TRACK NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...IN RESPONSE TO A LARGE
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH COVERING THE PACIFIC NORTH OF 20N BETWEEN
110W-130W...AND AN UPPER LOW NEAR 16N113W.  HOWEVER...THE LBAR...
BAMS...AND UKMET...THE LAST OF WHICH IS THE ONLY MODEL TO PROPERLY
INITIALIZE THE DISTURBANCE TO THE WEST OF THE DEPRESSION...ALL
SUGGEST A MORE WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.  BASED ON THE SUPERIOR
UKMET INITIALIZATION THE NORTHWEST OPTION SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS
TIME AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ESSENTIALLY AN UPDATE OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT FRI AUG 06 1999
 
THE DEPRESSION HAS BEEN MAINTAINING ENOUGH DEEP CONVECTION AND
BANDING DURING THE DAY TO WARRANT ITS UPGRADE TO TROPICAL STORM
DORA.  SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS ARE 35 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND
25 KT FROM AFWA.  OUTFLOW IS DECENT ON THE WESTERN SIDE AND SSTS ARE
NEARLY 29C.  THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE NO REASON WHY DORA SHOULD NOT
STRENGTHEN...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REACHES HURRICANE STRENGTH
WITHIN 48 HOURS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS.

THE INITIAL MOTION HAS REMAINED STEADY AT 285/15.  THE NOGAPS MODEL
MOVES DORA INITIALLY ON A NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...BUT THIS FORECAST IS
QUESTIONABLE BASED ON A VERY POOR INITIALIZATION OF THE DISTURBANCE
THAT IS NOW TROPICAL STORM EUGENE.  ALL OTHER GUIDANCE INDICATES A
WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK FOR 48 HOURS.  AFTER THAT...THE GFDL TURNS
DORA MORE TO THE NORTHWEST WHILE THE REMAINING GUIDANCE HAS A TURN
TO THE WEST OR EVEN WEST-SOUTHWEST...IN RESPONSE TO A RIDGE BUILDING
AHEAD OF THE STORM.  THIS APPEARS TO BE THE MORE LIKELY ALTERNATIVE
AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  COMPLICATING THE FORECAST IS THE TRACK OF EUGENE...WHICH
IS NOT MOVING AS FAST AS DORA...AND MAY COME INTO PLAY NEAR THE END
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

DORA CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED WITH GOOD OUTFLOW AND IS
MAINTAINING THE DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  SATELLITE DERIVED
T-NUMBERS ARE 2.5/2.5/3.0 FROM AIR FORCE GLOBAL/SAB/MIAMI. COMMENTS
SUGGEST CONSTRAINTS ON HIGHER T-NUMBERS... SO AM INCREASING INITIAL
INTENSITY TO 45 KNOTS.  SHIFOR AND SHIPS INCREASE INTENSITY AT ABOUT
10 KNOTS PER 12 HOURS OUT TO 48 HOURS.  OFFICIAL FOLLOWS THIS TREND
AND MAKES THE STORM A HURRICANE IN 24-HOURS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION HAS REMAINED STEADY AT 285/15.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS
VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...EXCEPT GFDL IS NOW NEAR
PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK DIRECTION BUT MUCH SLOWER.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

2 AM PDT SAT AUG 07 1999
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/13.  THIS IS TWO KNOTS SLOWER
THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND THE MOTION COULD BE EVEN SLOWER IF
THE SURFACE CENTER IS DIRECTLY UNDER THE SMALL PERSISTENT CDO. 
HOWEVER I AM RELUCTANT TO CHANGE THE MOTION VERY MUCH ON THE BASIS
OF INFRARED TRACKING.  THE GFDL AND NOGAPS MODELS SHOW THE STORM
SLOWING TO UNDER 8 KNOTS DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THE UKMET MODEL
IS ALSO SLOW BUT NOT AS SLOW AS THE TWO MENTIONED ABOVE.  THIS
DECELERATION IS PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF A UPPER LOW
NEAR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS CAUSING A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE
TO ITS SOUTH WHICH SHOULD SLOW DOWN THE STORM.  THE 00Z AVIATION
MODEL SUGGESTS THE RIDGE WILL NOT TOTALLY ERODE AND DORA IS
THEREFORE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE MOSTLY WESTWARD.  THE LBAR...BAM
MODELS...AND STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL MODELS ARE ALL FASTER.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SLOWED DOWN JUST A LITTLE FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

DVORAK ESTIMATES REMAIN THE SAME AS SIX HOURS AGO AND THE INITIAL
WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 45 KNOTS.  IF THE CENTER IS RIGHT UNDER THE
CDO...THE INTENSITY COULD BE HIGHER.  THE SHIPS MODEL CALLS FOR 82
KNOTS IN 60 HOURS COMPARED TO 85 KNOTS IN 60 HOURS SIX HOURS AGO. 
THIS IS BECAUSE THE PAST SIX HOUR TREND WENT FROM PLUS 10 KNOTS AT
00Z TO PLUS ZERO KNOTS AT 06Z.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS
CHANGED LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND REACHES 85 KNOTS IN 72
HOURS.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON REGULAR IR IMAGES AND WE HAVE
NOT RECEIVED ANY NEW MICROWAVE DATA LATELY.  THE CENTER APPEARS TO
BE ON THE NORTHEAST EDGE OF THE CONVECTION.  DORA HAS SLOWED DOWN
AND IS NOW MOVING 280/10.  THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO DORA'S PROXIMITY
TO A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.   MOST OF THE MODELS
...PRIMARILY THE AVN DEPENDENT...CONTINUE TO SHOW A WEST OR
WEST-SOUTHWEST TRACK IN RESPONSE TO A STRONG REBUILD OF THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  ONLY NOGAPS AND GFDI INDICATE A MORE NORTHERLY
COMPONENT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONTINUES WITH A GENERAL WESTWARD
TRACK ASSUMING THAT BOTH AVN AND UK ARE CORRECT IN REBUILDING THE
RIDGE.       

DORA HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN ORGANIZATION AS INDICATED BY LATEST
DVORAK T-NUMBERS.  THE GDFL GRADUALLY WEAKENS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE  
BUT BECAUSE...SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL...MY FAVORITE...INSISTS
ON BRINGING DORA TO 81 KNOTS...STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK.  MOST OF THE INCREASE IN INTENSITY FORECAST
BY SHIPS IS ATTRIBUTED TO WARM SST AND A LITTLE TO LOW SHEAR.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES AND MICROWAVE DATA CONFIRM THAT THE CENTER
WAS LOCATED ON THE NORTHEASTERN EDGE OF THE CONVECTION AND THE
INITIAL POSITION HAS TO BE ADJUSTED SOMEWHAT TO THE NORTH FROM THE
PREVIOUS POSITION. IMPORTANT FOR ALL USERS PLOTTING POINT BY
POINT...IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT DORA MOVED NORTHWARD...IT IS MOVING
ABOUT 295/08. GLOBAL MODELS AVAILABLE AT NHC SUGGEST THAT THE
CURRENT WEAKENING IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL INDUCE A SLOW MOTION
IN DORA IN THE SHORT TERM AND BECAUSE THE RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
REBUILD...A TURN TOWARD THE WEST IS EXPECTED BEYOND 24 HOURS. THIS
IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS.    

DVORAK T-NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED A BIT BUT THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION
HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY.  WATER IS WARM AND SHEAR IS LOW AND
SHIPS MODEL CONTINUE TO SHOW INTENSIFICATION.  THEREFORE...
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

UNCERTAINTY IN THIS MEASUREMENT...DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN THE CENTER

90 AND 102 KT DEPENDING ON SHORT TERM CHANGES IN THE CONVECTION.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 100 KT ON THIS ADVISORY. UPPER LEVEL
OUTFLOW IS CURRENTLY ASYMMETRIC...WITH EXCELLENT OUTFLOW OVER THE
SOUTHEAST SEMICIRCLE AND POOR ELSEWHERE. SATELLITE DATA AND MODEL
FORECASTS SUGGESTS THAT UPPER LEVEL WINDS COULD BECOME EVEN MORE
FAVORABLE FOR INTENSIFICATION DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS...AND THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST REFLECTS THIS.

THE INITIAL MOTION FOR THE ADVISORY IS THE 12 HOUR MOTION OF
265/08...ALTHOUGH THE LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTS A 270
DEGREE MOTION. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE TRACK FORECAST
PHILOSOPHY OR THE TRACK FORECAST. DORA SHOULD CONTINUE WESTWARD
SOUTH OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...WITH
SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED POSSIBLE AS THE RIDGE SLOWLY
STRENGTHENS.

DORA HAS NOT CHANGED A GREAT DEAL OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS...
MAINTAINING A SMALL WELL-DEFINED EYE 5-10 N MI IN DIAMETER. 
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 102 KT...BUT THE OBJECTIVE
DVORAK ESTIMATES OF LATE HAVE BEEN RUNNING 105-110 KT.  BASED ON
THESE...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS BUMPED UP TO 105 KT.  OUTFLOW
PATTERN IS ONLY FAIR.  THIS AND THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL SUGGESTS
THAT DORA MAY BE NEAR ITS PEAK INTENSITY.  
 
THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 265/8 AND THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE
TRACK FORECAST FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THE AVIATION MODEL HAS A
PECULIAR VORTEX ANALYZED SOUTH OF DORA THAT SWINGS THE CYCLONE
SOUTHWEST... AND MAY BE AFFECTING THE BAM MODELS AS WELL.  THE MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE AHEAD OF DORA IS FORECAST TO SLIDE EASTWARD...AND
SHOULD NUDGE THE HURRICANE GRADUALLY TO A WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK
OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

THE HURRICANE IS PEAKING WITH MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS REMAINING AT

WEAKENING. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT DORA MAY WEAKEN EVEN LESS THAN
CURRENTLY FORECAST GIVEN THE GENERALLY FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.

BY WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST LEANS TOWARD THE
NORTHERN CLUSTER BASED ON THE EXPECTATION THAT DORA WILL AT LEAST
SOMEWHAT RESPOND TO THE TROUGH. HOWEVER...THE CURRENT FORECAST IS A
LITTLE SOUTH OF AND FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BASED ON THE
CURRENT MOTION.
 
SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANALYSES INDICATE DORA IS ABOUT TO MOVE INTO
GRADUALLY COOLER WATER. SINCE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO REMAIN LIGHT...
THERE SHOULD BE ONLY A GRADUAL WEAKENING AT FIRST. THE AVN FORECASTS
20-30 KT SOUTHERLY 200 MB FLOW DEVELOPING OVER DORA BY 72 HOURS...
SIMILAR TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE OCCURRING WITH EUGENE. SHOULD THIS
VERIFY...DORA COULD WEAKEN MORE RAPIDLY THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST

STRONG DEEP LAYER OF EASTERLY WINDS WHICH IS FORECAST TO PERSIST AND
IS CLEARLY VISIBLE ON THE WATER VAPOR LOOP.  HOWEVER...IN 24 TO 36
HOURS DORA SHOULD MOVE INTO A WEAKER EASTERLY DEEP LAYER FLOW AND
BEGIN TO SLOW DOWN. THIS IS REFLECTED IN MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE.

THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE WITH AN ADJUSTMENT FOR THE FASTER SPEED.  ON THIS TRACK...A

THE EYE OF DORA IS BEGINNING TO FILL WITH CLOUD AND THE SURROUNDING
CLOUD TOPS ARE WARMING SLOWLY.  MORE STABLE TRADE WIND CLOUD CAN BE
SEEN ON SATELLITE ADVECTING INTO THE SYSTEM FROM THE NORTH AND WEST.
WHILE OUTFLOW REMAINS GOOD IN ALL DIRECTIONS...WEAKENING IS
CONTINUING. DVORAK T-NUMBERS HAVE DECREASED AND MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
NOW DOWN TO 110 KT.  GRADUAL WEAKENING IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE SHIFOR AND AVN MODELS AS THE STORM MOVES ON A
GENERALLY WESTWARD COURSE ACROSS 140W OVER SLIGHTLY COOLER SST TO
THE SOUTH OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
 
DORA CONTINUES TO MOVE WEST AT 18 KT BUT WILL GRADUALLY DROP ITS
FORWARD SPEED AS IT MOVES WEST OF THE CENTER OF THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE.  THE TRACK HAS BEEN KEPT CLOSE TO THE GFDL FOR THE FIRST 24
HOURS BUT THEN MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BAM MEDIUM AS WEAKENING
REDUCES THE EFFECT OF THE UPPER LAYER STEERING CURRENTS.  THIS WILL
BRING THE CENTER JUST SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERNMOST POINT OF THE BIG
ISLAND OF HAWAII IF DORA REMAINS ON THE FORECAST TRACK THROUGH 72

DORA IS WEAKENING...WITH THE EYE DISAPPEARING DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS. THE LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE ALL 102 KT...SO
THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE SET TO 100 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE. ALTHOUGH
FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY AS DORA MOVES OVER GRADUALLY COOLER
WATER...UPPER LEVEL SHEAR IS FORECAST TO REMAIN LIGHT. THE SHIPS
MODEL KEEPS DORA A HURRICANE THROUGH 72 HOURS...AND SO DOES THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/19. THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN IS SIMILAR TO 24
HOURS AGO...WITH A STRONG LOW LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF DORA AND A BREAK
IN THE MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE NEAR AND WEST OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE IS AGAIN SPLIT BETWEEN TWO POSSIBILITIES. THE
FIRST...SUPPORTED BY THE GFDL...BAMD...BAMM...AND LBAR...IS FOR A
TURN TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST WITH A TRACK JUST SOUTH OF THE ISLAND OF
HAWAII. THE SECOND...SUPPORTED BY THE P91E...P91UK...UKMET...AND
BAMS...IS FOR A MORE WESTWARD TRACK WELL SOUTH OF HAWAII. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE NORTHERN CLUSTER OF MODELS AND IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. IF DORA WEAKENS FASTER THAN
CURRENTLY FORECAST...THERE WOULD BE A GREATER CHANCE OF A MORE
WESTWARD MOTION.

THE 50 KT WINDS RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON THE OBSERVED STORM
MOTION AND WEAKENING.

THIS WILL BE THE LAST ADVISORY ON DORA ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL
HURRICANE CENTER. SUBSEQUENT ADVISORIES WILL BE ISSUED BY THE
CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER IN HONOLULU HAWAII.

WERE MILD AS COMPARED TO HURRICANE JOHN OF 1994.  DORA REMAINS

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT FRI AUG 06 1999
 
THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION HAS REMAINED WELL ORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON
FOLLOWING ITS RAPID DEVELOPMENT THIS MORNING.  SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE AT 30 KT...BUT BOTH WOULD BE HIGHER
IF NOT CONSTRAINED BY CLASSIFICATION RULES.  ALTHOUGH SMALL AND
SOMEWHAT ELONGATED...THE SYSTEM IS DEVELOPING GOOD OUTER BANDS...AND
IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM EUGENE IN THIS PACKAGE.

INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE 285/5...BUT WITH MORE THAN THE
USUAL UNCERTAINTY.  MID-LEVEL WINDS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN/CIMSS SHOW A LARGE RIDGE AHEAD OF EUGENE THAT SHOULD KEEP
THE STORM ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WEST TRACK DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INCREASES THE SPEED TO MORE
CLIMATOLOGICAL VALUES TOWARDS THE END OF THE PERIOD.

THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL BRINGS EUGENE TO ABOUT 55 KT...
BUT THIS IS BASED ON THE LBAR TRACK WHICH IS OVER SIGNIFICANTLY
COOLER WATERS THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  EVEN SO...THE ENVIRONMENT
AHEAD OF THE STORM DOES NOT LOOK ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE...AND THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT EUGENE WILL BECOME A
HURRICANE.

THE CIRCULATION OF TROPICAL STORM EUGENE HAS CONTINUED TO GET BETTER
ORGANIZED THIS EVENING.  HOWEVER...THE CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED AND
THE T-NUMBERS SUGGEST THAT THE SYSTEM IS STILL A MINIMAL TROPICAL
STORM.  INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 35 KNOTS.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY
FORECAST MODEL...USING THE OFFICIAL TRACK AS INPUT...NOW BRINGS
EUGENE TO A 65 KNOT HURRICANE IN 72 HOURS.  AS NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE...THE ENVIRONMENT AHEAD OF THE STORM DOES NOT LOOK
ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DOES NOT ANTICIPATE
THAT EUGENE WILL BECOME A HURRICANE.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE 295/8...SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN
PREVIOUS.  MODEL GUIDANCE GENERALLY MOVES STORM WEST-NORTHWEST AND
SLOWLY TURNS TOWARD THE WEST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS
GENERAL SCENARIO.

THE IR CONVECTIVE PATTERN APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE DISTORTED TO THE
SOUTH.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN THE SAME AS SIX HOURS AGO.
THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 35 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST IS TO 60
KNOTS AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE SHIPS MODEL GOES A LITTLE
HIGHER BUT THE LACK OF APPARENT RECENT STRENGTHENING IS THE BASIS
FOR CONSERVATISM.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/08.  THE STORM IS NEARING THE
LONGITUDE OF MAXIMUM WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH AND ALL OF
THE GUIDANCE EXCEPT THE NOGAPS SHOWS A MOSTLY WESTWARD ACCELERATION
DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MOTION INCREASES TO
ABOUT 10 KNOTS IN 48 HOURS WHICH IS MORE OR LESS IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE GUIDANCE.

THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH EUGENE HAS NOT CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE PAST 12 HOURS AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
REMAINS AT 35 KNOTS.  AS IN THE CASE OF DORA...GFDL WEAKENS THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE WHILE SHIPS MODEL STRENGTHEN IT...BUT ONLY TO 64
KNOTS. INTENSIFICATION IS MAINLY DUE TO LOW SHEAR AND WARM
WATERS...ACCORDING TO THE SHIPS OUTPUT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
BRINGS EUGENE TO 60 KNOTS IN AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS AND THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/08.  ALL MODELS EXCEPT
NOGAPS...WHICH MAINTAINS EUGENE MEANDERING... SUGGEST A WEST AND
EVEN A WEST-SOUTHWEST TRACK.  THIS MOTION IS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE
A DEVELOPING SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE STORM
INDICATED BY GLOBAL MODELS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN BETWEEN THE
MODELS AND CALLS FOR A WESTWARD TRACK WITH A SMALL INCREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED AS INDICATED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW A CLOUD BAND WRAPPING AROUND THE
SYSTEM GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF THE FORMATION OF A BANDING TYPE EYE.
IF THE TREND CONTINUES...EUGENE MAY INTENSIFY FASTER THAN 
ANTICIPATED. INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 50 KNOTS AT THIS
TIME AND A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED.  THIS BASED ON SHIPS
MODEL...AND THE PREVAILING LOW SHEAR AND WARM SST. HOWEVER...
RELATIVELY STABLE AIR IS ALONG THE FUTURE PATH OF THE STORM.  THIS
IS NOT VERY FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING.  
 
INITIAL NOTION IS 285/09.  A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
BUILD NORTH AND NORTHWEST OF EUGENE...THEREFORE A TRACK MORE TO WEST
IS EXPECTED.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS.

MORE BANDING FEATURES ON INFRARED IMAGERY.  HOWEVER DVORAK T-NUMBERS
REMAIN AT 3.5 AT THIS TIME...SO CURRENT INTENSITY REMAINS AT 55
KNOTS.  EUGENE IS FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE SOON...WHICH IS IN
AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS MODEL GUIDANCE.  HOWEVER MARGINAL OCEAN
TEMPERATURES SHOULD PREVENT THE CYCLONE FROM STRENGTHENING
SUBSTANTIALLY.

MOTION IS ABOUT 285/10.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS A MID-LEVEL
RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE TROPICAL STORM.  THEREFORE A MAINLY
WESTWARD MOVEMENT IS INDICATED.  THIS IS ALSO SHOWN BY THE
STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL TRACK MODEL AND THE BAROTROPIC MODEL

HURRICANE EUGENE DISCUSSION NUMBER  19
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT TUE AUG 10 1999

EUGENE CONTINUES TO SHOW AN IRREGULAR CDO WITH CLOUD TOPS TO -80C.
THE LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 90 KT...77 KT...AND 90
KT FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA RESPECTIVELY. THE INITIAL INTENSITY
THUS REMAINS AT 85 KT.

ALL NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE...EXCEPT THE LBAR...IS CLUSTERED AROUND A
WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THE AVN AND
NOGAPS MODELS INDICATE AN MID/UPPER LEVEL BREAK IN THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE NORTH OF EUGENE NEAR THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD...WHILE THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS STRONG. THIS INTRODUCES
UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER THE STORM WILL TURN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST
OR CONTINUE GENERALLY WESTWARD NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE POSSIBILITIES
AND IS CLOSEST TO THE BAMD.
 
THE SOMEWHAT RAGGED CLOUD PATTERN SUGGESTS EUGENE IS CURRENTLY
SUFFERING SOME EASTERLY SHEAR. THE AVN AND NOGAPS BUILD AN UPPER
LEVEL RIDGE WESTWARD WITH THE HURRICANE...SUGGESTING THAT SHEAR
SHOULD STAY LIGHT TO MODERATE DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS.
ADDITIONALLY...SSTS COOL ONLY BY 1-2C ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK. THIS
COMBINATION SUGGESTS THAT FURTHER WEAKENING OF EUGENE WILL BE SLOW.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS THIS...WITH EUGENE REMAINING A
HURRICANE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES HAVE LOWERED ON EUGENE AND ARE NOW 77
AND 65 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...RESPECTIVELY.  MOST OF THE CONVECTION
IS NOW EAST OF THE PRESUMED CENTER...PROMPTING SAB TO USE THE SHEAR
PATTERN IN ITS CLASSIFICATION.  OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS LOWERED TO 75
KT.  WITH LOW SHEAR FORECAST AND SUFFICIENT SSTS...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR ONLY MODEST ADDITIONAL WEAKENING DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD...IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY
MODEL.

THE FORECAST TRACK PRESENTS SOMETHING OF A CHALLENGE.  ALL THE
GLOBAL MODELS BUILD A MID-LEVEL RIDGE AHEAD OF EUGENE...WITH THE
ECMWF AND UKMET SHOWING A BREAK IN THE RIDGE TO THE EAST OF HAWAII. 
THE AVN SHOWS A WEAKNESS NEAR THE ISLANDS...AND THE NOGAPS EXTENDS
THE RIDGE MUCH FARTHER TO THE WEST.  WHICH OF THESE VERIFIES GREATLY
DETERMINES THE THREAT OF EUGENE TO HAWAII.  ANOTHER FACTOR IS HOW
QUICKLY EUGENE SPINS DOWN.  A STRONGER STORM WILL LIKELY MOVE WITH
THE DEEP LAYER FLOW AND TRACK CLOSER TO THE ISLANDS...WHILE IF
EUGENE WEAKENS FASTER THAN FORECAST...IT SHOULD STAY WELL TO THE
SOUTH.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE FOR THIS PACKAGE IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF
THE PREVIOUS SET OF MODEL RUNS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NUDGED
SOUTH AS WELL...IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL AND THE BAM MODELS.
 
THE NOAA GULFSTREAM IV JET AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN TASKED TO FLY IN THE
ENVIRONMENT OF HURRICANE EUGENE ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON TO HELP
PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE SYNOPTIC STEERING CURRENTS.

WITH EUGENE CROSSING PAST 140 DEGREES LONGITUDE...RESPONSIBILITY FOR
FUTURE ADVISORIES NOW PASSES TO THE CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE
CENTER.

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THAT WAS LOCATED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES
SOUTHWEST OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA HAS GOTTEN BETTER
ORGANIZED DURING THE DAY.  A WELL DEFINE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION IS
EVIDENT IN THE VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY.  WIND SPEEDS COMPUTED FROM
SEVERAL OF THE LOW LEVEL CLOUD ELEMENTS GIVE VALUES THAT RANGE FROM
20 TO ALMOST 30 KNOTS.  ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE CIRCULATION IS EXPOSED
ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER DEEP CONVECTION
HAS BEEN PERSISTING ON THE WESTERN SIDE.  T-NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED
AND ARE NOW 2.0 FROM BOTH SAB AND MIAMI.  THEREFORE...THE
DISTURBANCE IS UP-GRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION NINE-E.

INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 285/12.  THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO
MOVE IN THIS GENERAL DIRECTION UNTIL IT COMES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
THE RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST...AT WHICH TIME IT SHOULD TAKE MORE OF A
WESTERLY DIRECTION SIMILAR TO ITS PREDECESSORS.  THE GUIDANCE MODELS
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO.

INTENSITY GUIDANCE MODELS DEVELOP THE SYSTEM RATHER SLOWLY.  PART OF
THIS MAY BE DUE TO SLIGHTLY COOLER SSTS CAUSED BY THE UP-WELLING
FROM THE PASSAGE OF EUGENE AND DORA AS WELL AS A MORE STABLE
ENVIRONMENT LEFT IN THEIR WAKE.

ALTHOUGH ASSOCIATED DEEP CONVECTION IS DISORGANIZED...TROPICAL
DEPRESSION NINE-E HAS A LARGE AND WELL-DEFINED LOW LEVEL
CIRCULATION. THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE SET TO 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY IN
AGREEMENT WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/12. MOST NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE TURNS THE
CYCLONE WESTWARD OVER THE NEXT 48 TO 72 HOURS UNDER A DEEP LAYER
RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST...WITH THE ONLY QUESTION THE LATITUDE AT
WHICH THE TURN WILL OCCUR. THE NOGAPS OFFERS A ALTERNATE
SCENARIO...WITH A TROUGH ALONG THE U.S. WEST COAST DIGGING FAR
ENOUGH SOUTHWARD TO BREAK THE RIDGE AND MOVE THE CYCLONE
NORTHEASTWARD. CURRENT WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUPPORTS THE WESTWARD
MOTION...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.

CIRRUS CLOUD MOTIONS INDICATE AN ANTICYCLONE OVER THE CONVECTION...
WHICH IS DISPLACED WEST AND NORTHWEST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER. THIS
SUGGESTS EASTERLY SHEAR. THE AVN AND NOGAPS SUGGEST THE SHEAR MAY
DECREASE AS THE DEPRESSION GAINS LATITUDE. HOWEVER...THE EXPECTED
GAINING WOULD BRING THE CYCLONE OVER COOLER WATER. THE SHEAR IS
LIKELY TO SLOW INTENSIFICATION EARLY IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND
THE COMBINATION OF A LARGE SYSTEM AND COOLER WATER IS LIKELY TO SLOW
INTENSIFICATION LATER IN THE PERIOD. THUS...THE FORECAST IS FOR SLOW
INTENSIFICATION SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

NO REASON TO CHANGE IT AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER...BOTH GFDL AND AVN
MODELS WEAKEN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.

CENTER. THE LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 35 KT FROM SAB
AND 30 KT FROM TAFB AND AFWA. GIVEN THE SHEARED APPEARANCE AND THE

DEPRESSION FOR THIS PACKAGE.

VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWS THE CYCLONE MOVING A LITTLE FASTER THAN

GUIDANCE CALLS FOR A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK WITH A TURN TO
THE WEST BETWEEN 48 AND 72 HOURS. AN ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS
SUPPORTED BY THE GFDL...UKMET...AND NOGAPS...WHICH TURN THE
DEPRESSION EAST TO NORTHEAST AFTER 24 HOURS. THIS APPEARS TO BE DUE

TROPICAL DEPRESSION TEN-E IS CURRENTLY IN A MODERATE EASTERLY SHEAR

NORTH-NORTHWEST OF TAFB AND THE AFWA FIX IS EVEN FARTHER NORTH.  THE
UNCERTAIN INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 295/11...NOT MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  MOST OF THE 18Z TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
MOVE THE SYSTEM GENERALLY WESTWARD AT 10 KNOTS OR MORE.  BUT THE 12Z
UKMET SHOWS AN EASTWARD MOTION AND THE 12Z NOGAPS SHOWS A SLOW NORTH
TO NORTHEASTWARD MOTION FOR 72 HOURS.  THE GFDL IS NOT AVAILABLE. 
GIVEN THIS SPREAD IN THE GUIDANCE...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
TURNS THE SYSTEM WESTWARD BUT SLOWS THE FORWARD SPEED TO 5 KT AFTER
48 HOURS.  THIS IS JUST A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

THE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 35 KNOTS FROM TAFB...SAB AND
AFWA.  THIS IS BASED ON AN IMPRESSIVE COLD CDO LOCATED WEST OF THE
CENTER.  HOWEVER THE DEPRESSION IS NOT UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM
ON THIS ADVISORY BECAUSE OF THE APPARENT POORLY DEFINED CENTER.  THE
FORECAST WIND SPEED IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...CALLING
FOR A TROPICAL STORM IN 12 HOURS AND A HURRICANE IN 72 HOURS.  THIS
IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS MODEL WHICH SHOWS A VERTICAL SHEAR OF
23 KT REDUCING TO 10 KT IN 48 HOURS.

THE TROPICAL CYCLONE REMAINS IN A SHEARED STATE WITH MULTI-CHANNEL
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATING THAT THE CIRCULATION CENTER IS JUST
ON THE NORTHEAST EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THIS IS CONFIRMED
BY 85GHZ DATA FROM THE LATEST TRMM SATELLITE PASS.  DVORAK CURRENT
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB AND AFGW ARE ALL 35 KT.
THEREFORE...TROPICAL DEPRESSION TEN-E IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM
FERNANDA.
 
USING THE TRMM POSITION ESTIMATE AND THE LATEST SATELLITE FIXES THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 295/15 KT.  THIS REPRESENTS A 4 KT
INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED FROM THE LAST ADVISORY. SOME OF THE
DYNAMIC-BASED GUIDANCE IS STILL DIVERSE WITH NOGAPS BRINGING THE
CYCLONE NORTH AND DISSIPATING IT BY 36 HRS WHILE THE UKMET MOVES THE
SYSTEM WEST-NORTHWEST THROUGH 24 HRS BEFORE MAKING A SHARP LEFT TURN
TOWARD THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST. IN BOTH INSTANCES EACH MODEL FAVORS THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM NEAR THE COAST OF MEXICO. THE REMAINDER OF
THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE AGREES ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION
THROUGH 24 HRS WITH A MORE WESTERLY HEADING THEREAFTER. THE PRIMARY
DIFFERENCES LIE IN THE FORWARD MOTION WITH THE GFDL BEING THE
SLOWEST OF WHILE LBAR AND P91E THE FASTEST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN CLIPER AND P91E ALTHOUGH CONSIDERABLY SLOWER
...IN LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
ANALYSES FROM THE CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN INDICATE THAT
15-20 KT EASTERLY/SOUTHEASTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR EXTENDS TO NEAR
125W N OF 12N. THE LATEST AVAILABLE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL OUTPUT DEPICTS
THIS FAIRLY WELL AND SUGGESTS THAT THE SHEAR WILL DIMINISH TO NEAR 
10 KT BY 36 HRS. HOWEVER...THE FORECAST TRACK BRINGS THE SYSTEM OVER
GRADUALLY COOLER WATER. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING WITH FERNANDA FORECAST TO REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH BY
72 HRS...IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS.

WHILE FERNANDA REMAINS IN A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT...THE CENTER HAS
DISAPPEARED UNDER THE DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. THE
LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 45 KT FROM SAB AND 35 KT
FROM TAFB AND AFWA. THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY IS SET TO 40 KT FOR THIS
ADVISORY.

SINCE CONVECTION HAS SPREAD OVER THE PREVIOUSLY EXPOSED CENTER...THE
INITIAL MOTION HAS AGAIN BECOME UNCERTAIN. THE BEST ESTIMATE IS
295/11...WHICH IS THE 12 HOUR MOTION. THE AVN BASED GUIDANCE AND THE
GFDL INDICATE A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST TO WEST MOTION...WHILE THE
UKMET AND THE NOGAPS DRASTICALLY SLOW THE SYSTEM OR TURN IT BACK TO
THE EAST IN RESPONSE TO THE DISTURBANCE SOUTHWEST OF ACAPULCO. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO POSSIBILITIES...
INDICATING A SLOWING OF THE WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD.

ANALYSES FROM THE CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CONTINUE TO
INDICATE 15-20 KT EASTERLY/SOUTHEASTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR NEAR
FERNANDA. THIS IS ABOUT A 15 KT DECREASE FROM YESTERDAY. THE AVN AND
SHIPS MODELS FORECAST A FURTHER DECREASE IN THE SHEAR...WHICH SHOULD
ALLOW A FASTER DEVELOPMENT. THE INTENSITY FORECAST REFLECTS THIS AND
BRINGS FERNANDA TO HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 36 HOURS. AFTER THAT...THE
CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO COOLER WATER WHICH IS LIKELY TO
STOP INTENSIFICATION.

NORTHWEST TO WEST MOTION. MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT
ON THIS TRACK THAN 6 HOURS AGO...AS THE NOGAPS AND UKMET MODELS ARE

ANALYSES FROM THE CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN NOW INDICATE
INDICATE 15 KT EASTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR NEAR FERNANDA. WITH THE
AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS FORECASTING A FURTHER DECREASE IN THE
SHEAR...FERNANDA SHOULD CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY UNTIL IT MOVES OVER

A STRONG CLUSTER TO THE WEST OF THE CENTER. SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB REMAIN ABOUT 3.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE SO
INITIAL INTENSITY IS UNCHANGED. FERNANDA HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME
STRENGTHENING BEFORE REACHING COOL WATER IN 36 HOURS OR SO. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 290/11.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS SUGGEST THAT A
GRADUAL TURN MORE TO WEST SHOULD BEGIN IN 36 HOURS AS A STRONG MID-
LEVEL RIDGE DEVELOPS TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. FERNANDA
SHOULD MOVE A LITTLE FASTER AS IT WEAKENS AND BECOME STEERED BY THE

8 PM PDT FRI AUG 20 1999
 
FERNANDA HAS BECOME A TIGHT SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS WITH A CLUSTER OF
DEEP CONVECTION SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER.  ALTHOUGH FERNANDA IS
BEING DOWNGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME...THERE MAY
STILL BE SOME WIND GUSTS TO TROPICAL STORM FORCE IN TRANSIENT
CONVECTION.
 
FERNANDA IS EXPECETD TO MOVE ON THE SAME GENERAL WEST-SOUTHWEST
TRACK ABOUT 7 KNOTS...STEERED BY THE LOW LEVEL FLOW AS INDICATED BY
BAM MODELS.
 
THE DEPRESSION IS NOT FORECAST TO REINTENSIFY BUT IF IT MOVES SOUTH
ENOUGH...IT WILL BE MOVING OVER WARMER WATERS AND REGENERATION MAY
OCCUR.

FERNANDA HAS LOST ALL BUT SPORADIC DEEP CONVECTION AND IS EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE TO SLOWLY WIND DOWN OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE AT 30 KNOTS. THE 30 KNOT
WINDS ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR NORTH OF THE CENTER. THE FORECAST
TRACK IS INITIALLY 255/9. THIS WEST SOUTHWEST MOTION INDUCED BY THE
PREVAILING TRADE WINDS BRINGS FERNANDA INTO SLIGHTLY WARMER WATERS
THAT MAY ENCOURAGE PERIODIC FLAREUPS OF CONVECTION. THE CHANCE OF
FERNANDA REGENERATING IS HOWEVER SLIGHT BUT ITS WELL-DEFINED LOW-
LEVEL CIRCULATION IS LIKELY TO PERSIST FOR SOME TIME.

8 KNOTS...INITIAL MOTION 255/8...AND IS BEING STEERED BY THE
PREVAILING TRADE WIND FLOW OVER RELATIVELY WARM 26 TO 27 DEGREE

ALTHOUGH SSTS ARE SUFFICIENT FOR DEVELOPMENT.  SHIPS FORECAST MODEL
WANTS TO TAKE SYSTEM BACK TO A TROPICAL STORM.  THE INITIAL AND

SATELLITE MICROWAVE IMAGERY AND SHIP REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE BROAD
TROPICAL DISTURBANCE NEAR THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA NOW
HAS A SUFFICIENTLY WELL-DEFINED SURFACE CIRCULATION TO BE CLASSIFIED
AS TROPICAL DEPRESSION ELEVEN-E.  THIS MORNING CONVECTION INCREASED
AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS BECAME MORE COHERENT.  THE DEPRESSION IS
CLOSE TO COLD WATER AND CONVECTION IS ALREADY DECREASING...SO I
EXPECT THE DEPRESSION TO BE SHORT-LIVED.

INITIAL LOCATION AND MOTION ARE QUITE UNCERTAIN AS THE CENTER IS
HARD TO FIND...BUT THE MOTION IS ESTIMATED AS 315/3.  MODEL GUIDANCE
TAKES THE DEPRESSION AWAY FROM THE COAST AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS SUIT...A COMPROMISE BETWEEN CLIPER AND THE SHALLOW BAM. 
GIVEN THE TRACK AND COLD SSTS...NO WARNINGS ARE DEEMED NECESSARY AT
THIS TIME.

THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION ELEVEN-E HAS BEEN RELOCATED
FURTHER NORTH AND IS NOW ABOUT 150 MILES WEST OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF
BAJA CALIFORNIA. THIS POSITION PLACES IT CLOSE TO THE 24 DEGREE
CELSIUS ISOTHERM AND ITS CURRENT NORTHWESTWARD TRACK WILL RAPIDLY
TAKE IT OVER COLDER WATERS. CONVECTION AROUND THE CENTER HAS
DECREASED DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS AND IS NOW MAINLY TO
THE SOUTH. THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE HELD AT 30 KNOTS FOR THE FIRST 12
HOURS WITH WEAKENING THEREAFTER AND DISSIPATION AFTER 48 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 315/8. THERE IS MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE CURRENT
LOCATION BASED ON CLOSER AGREEMENT OF SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB...
SAB AND GWC. THE MODEL FORECASTS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH A
NORTHWEST TRACK INTO COLDER WATER. THE NEW TRACK IS SLIGHTLY NORTH
AND FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WHICH MAY EQUATE TO AN EVEN
FASTER DEMISE OF THIS SYSTEM.

THE LARGE MONSOON-TYPE DISTURBANCE THAT HAS PERSISTED OFF THE
MEXICAN COAST FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED
ABOUT 50 MILES SOUTHWEST OF MANZANILLO. SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 30 KT...SO ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED
ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE-E.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN...WITH THE BEST ESTIMATE OF 340/06.
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES AN ANTICYCLONE OVER NORTHERN MEXICO
WITH LARGE UPPER LEVEL LOW DEVELOPING WEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
THIS SUGGESTS A NORTHWESTWARD MOTION...WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE NHC
HURRICANE GUIDANCE. THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST STARTS WITH A SLOW
NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION THAT TURNS MORE NORTHWEST IN TIME.

THE DEPRESSION HAS GOOD CONVECTIVE BANDING AND GOOD OUTFLOW...AND
THUS COULD BECOME A TROPICAL STORM THIS AFTERNOON. THE FORECAST
TRACK KEEPS THE SYSTEM OVER WARM WATER...SO GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST WITH THE CYCLONE REACHING HURRICANE STRENGTH IN ABOUT 48
HOURS.

DUE TO THE EXPECTED STRENGTHENING AND PROXIMITY TO THE MEXICAN
COAST...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE BEING ISSUED FOR THE AREA
BETWEEN MANZANILLO AND CABO CORRIENTES...AS WELL AS FOR THE ISLAS
MARIAS. THE CYCLONE COULD THREATEN OTHER PARTS OF THE MEXICAN

INDICATE A RIDGE OVER MEXICO TO THE NORTHEAST OF GREG AND AN
MID/UPPER LEVEL LOW WEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE STORM IS

AVIATION MODEL BASED GUIDANCE. HOWEVER...THE FORECAST TRACK IS ALONG
THE RIGHT EDGE OF THE GUIDANCE...AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW COULD

GREG CONTINUES TO HAVE STRONG CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND GOOD
OUTFLOW. STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY TO BE SLOW FOR THE FIRST 12 TO 24
HOURS DUE TO PROXIMITY TO LAND. AFTER THAT TIME...STEADY
STRENGTHENING TO HURRICANE STATUS IS EXPECTED. THE FORECAST TRACK

THE BURSTING PATTERN CONTINUES ON IR IMAGERY...BUT THERE IS LITTLE
EVIDENCE OF BANDING.  CURRENT DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN AT
45 KNOTS.  SINCE THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW LOOKS REASONABLY
FAVORABLE...SOME STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY UNTIL THE CENTER PASSES BY
CABO SAN LUCAS.

THE CENTER IS NOT WELL-DEFINED BUT THE HEADING NOW APPEARS TO BE
NORTHWESTWARD.  STEERING FLOW ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE OF A MID-LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. SHOULD CAUSE A TURN TO A MORE
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TRACK WITHIN 24 HOURS.  HOWEVER THIS MAY NOT COME
SOON ENOUGH TO AVERT LANDFALL NEAR SOUTHERN BAJA.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST HAS BEEN SHIFTED A LITTLE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE AND IS
ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NUMERICAL GUIDANCE.

GREG IS NEARING HURRCIANE STRENGTH. THE MEXICAN RADAR AT LOS CABOS
INDICATES AN EYE FORMING...AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB AND SAB ARE 55-60 KT AND 55 KT RESPECTIVELY. THE MAXIMUM
SUSTAINED WINDS ARE SET TO 60 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY...AND GREG WILL
LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO A HURRICANE LATER TODAY...IF IT IS NOT ONE
ALREADY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS SET TO THE 12 HOUR MOTION OF 300/9...ALTHOUGH
THE SHORT TERM MOTION MAY BE MORE WESTERLY. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES INDICATES A MID/UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER NORTHWEST
MEXICO AND A MID/UPPER LEVEL LOW NEAR 30N124W. THE MEXICAN RIDGE
FAVORS A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE NHC
GUIDANCE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHFITED SOMEWHAT SOUTH OF
THE PREVIOUS TRACK BASED ON THE INITIAL POSITION AND THE MORE
WESTERLY MOTION. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW COULD CAUSE A MORE NORTHERLY
TRACK LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. HOWEVER...GREG WILL BE WEAKENING
OVER COLD WATER BY THAT TIME...SO THE LOW MAY NOT HAVE MUCH OF AN
EFFECT.
 
GREG CONTINUES TO HAVE STRONG CONVECTION AND GOOD OUTFLOW...SO
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST UNTIL IT MOVES OVER COLDER WATER...WHICH
STARTS AT ABOUT 110W. STEADY WEAKENING SHOULD OCCUR THEREAFTER.

HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE BEING ISSUED FOR THE SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA
PENINSULA BASED ON THE CURRENT FORECAST TRACK...WIND RADII...AND THE
INHERENT UNCERTAINIES IN BOTH.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 65 KT...SO GREG
IS UPGRADED TO A MINIMAL HURRICANE. AT LEAST A PARTIAL EYE HAS BEEN
PRESENT ON THE LOS CABOS RADAR DURING THE DAY. THAT BEING SAID...THE
SYSTEM IS GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF BEING SHEARED. THERE IS NO
OUTFLOW TO THE NORTHEAST SIDE...AND SOME OF THE LOW CLOUD LINES
NORTHEAST OF THE EYE ARE EXPOSED. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND VERTICAL
SHEAR ANALYSES FROM CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SUGGEST
LESS THAN 20 KT OF SHEAR...SO THE RAGGED APPEARANCE IS A BIT
PUZZLING. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A LITTLE MORE
INTENSIFICATION BEFORE GREG HITS COOLER WATER...FOLLOWED BY STEADY
WEAKENING. 

THE MOTION HAS BEEN A LITTLE ERRATIC AT TIMES...BUT IS ESTIMATED TO
BE 305/6. THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED FROM SIX HOURS
AGO...WITH RIDGING OVER NORTHWEST MEXICO NORTH OF GREG AND AN UPPER
LEVEL LOW NEAR 29N125W. THIS WOULD SUGGEST A CONTINUED WEST-
NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION. HOWEVER...THE TRACK FORECAST GUIDANCE
IS QUITE DIVERSE...WITH FORECASTS RANGING FROM STRAIGHT NORTHWEST TO
A TURN TO THE WEST-SOUTHWEST. THE SPEEDS ARE ALSO DIVERSE...WITH THE
GFDL...NOGAPS...UKMET..AND AVN BEING VERY SLOW AND THE OTHER
GUIDANCE BEING FASTER. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/07.  THIS BRINGS THE CENTER OF
THE HURRICANE TO WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA
CALIFORNIA IN 12 HOURS.  THEREAFTER THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
INDICATE MOTIONS RANGING BETWEEN WEST AND NORTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST TURNS THE HURRICANE WESTWARD...FOLLOWING THE
GFDL...UKMET...NOGAPS AND BAM MODELS.

THE DEEP CONVECTION IS NOT LOOKING VERY IMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE
IMAGERY AND IS MOSTLY SOUTH OF THE CENTER.  BUT LOS CABOS RADAR
SHOWS A FAIRLY WELL DEFINED EYE...EXCEPT IT IS OPEN TO THE NORTH. 
GREG IS APPROACHING COLD SSTS AND THE WESTERN THIRD OF ITS
CIRCULATION IS ALREADY OVER COLD WATER.  SO THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE
OPPORTUNITY FOR STRENGTHENING...PERHAPS UP TO 70 KNOTS IN 12 HOURS
BUT EVEN THIS IS NOT LIKELY.

IF THE STRONG WINDS ARE CONFINED TO THE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION...IT
IS POSSIBLE THAT BAJA CALIFORNIA COULD MISS THE WORST OF THIS
HURRICANE.  SO FAR THE WINDS AT SAN JOSE DEL CABO HAVE ONLY BEEN UP
TO 12 KNOTS.  THIS WILL BE RESOLVED IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS.

THE FORWARD SPEED HAS SLOWED A BIT...AND LATEST RADAR IMAGES FROM
LOS CABOS INDICATE THAT THE CENTER HAS NOT YET PASSED THE LONGITUDE
OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA.  THE EYEWALL APPEARS OPEN ON
THE NORTHERN SIDE...SO STRONGEST WEATHER EFFECTS ARE ON THE SOUTH
SIDE OF THE EYE AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF
CONVECTIVE ELEMENTS ROTATING AROUND TO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
CYCLONE DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  IF THIS OCCURS...CONDITIONS IN
THE CABO SAN LUCAS AREA COULD WORSEN. 

GREG IS NOT AS WELL ORGANIZED ON SATELLITE IMAGES AS IT WAS ON
MONDAY..WITH LESS DEEP CONVECTION AS WELL.  BUT THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE
STILL GIVES A CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 65 KNOTS.  NOT FAR TO
THE WEST OF CABO SAN LUCAS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GRADIENT OF SEA
SURFACE TEMPERATURES.  THEREFORE ONCE THE CENTER MOVES A FEW DEGREES
FARTHER WESTWARD...GREG WILL ENCOUNTER SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER WATERS. 
WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN IN 24 HOURS OR SO.

THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE. A
LARGE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW NORTH OF 25N AND WEST OF 120W COULD
CAUSE A MORE NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION LATER IN THE PERIOD...BUT
THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECAST SHOWS THIS LOW LIFTING NORTHWARD WITH TIME
AND THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL LIKELY BE RESPONDING MORE TO LOWER-
TROPOSPHERIC STEERING IN 2-3 DAYS.

EARLY MORNING VISIBLE IMAGES INDICATE GREG IS...AT BEST...BARELY A
MINIMAL HURRICANE...WITH THE LOW LEVEL CENTER EXPOSED ON THE
NORTHEAST EDGE OF THE CONVECTION. CIRRUS CLOUDS FROM A CONVECTIVE
BAND NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER ARE BLOWING ACROSS THE CENTER...
INDICATING MODERATE TO STRONG SHEAR. IF CURRENT TRENDS CONTINUE...
GREG WILL BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM LATER TODAY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS THE 12 HOUR MOTION OF 315/4...ALTHOUGH RECENT
SATELLITE FIXES INDICATE A MORE NORTHERLY SHORT TERM MOTION. A WELL
DEFINED ANTICYCLONE IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER NORTHERN MEXICO
SHOULD PRODUCE A NORTHWEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION FOR THE NEXT DAY
OR TWO. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE REFLECTS THIS...ALTHOUGH AS SEEN
YESTERDAY...THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF SPREAD IN THE 72 HOUR FORECAST
POINTS BETWEEN A NORTHWEST MOTION AND A TURN TO THE WEST-SOUTHWEST.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...SHIFTED
A LITTLE TO THE NORTH EARLY ON DUE TO THE MORE NORTHERLY POSITION.

SHEAR IS TAKING ITS TOLL ON GREG...AND THE CENTER WILL PASS NEAR THE
SOUTH END OF BAJA CALIFORNIA DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS. AFTER
THAT... IT WILL ENCOUNTER COLDER WATER. THE COMBINATION OF THE THREE
EVENTS SHOULD PRODUCE WEAKENING...AND THE INTENSITY FORECAST
REFLECTS THIS.

CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH GREG HAS DECREASED AND BECOME VERY
DISORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON IN BOTH SATELLITE AND RADAR DATA.
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM SAN JOSE DEL CABO HAVE SHOWN WINDS OF LESS
THAN TROPICAL STORM FORCE AND A LOWEST PRESSURE OF ABOUT 1003 MB.
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB HAVE DECREASED TO 55
KT AND 45 KT RESPECTIVELY. GREG IS THUS DOWNGRADED TO A 50 KT
TROPICAL STORM.

GREG MOVED ALMOST DUE NORTH FOR A TIME TODAY...BUT HAS NOW TAKEN A
COURSE OF 330/4. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN EITHER THE FORECAST
PHILOSOPHY OR THE FORECAST GUIDANCE FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. GREG
IS EXPECTED TO MOVE GENERALLY NORTHWEST UNDER THE MEXICAN RIDGE...
FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST AS IT WEAKENS AND LOW LEVEL
STEERING BECOMES DOMINANT.

STRONG SHEAR HAS CAUSED GREG TO WEAKEN UP TO NOW...AND THE CYCLONE
WILL ENCOUNTER COLDER WATER AFTER CROSSING BAJA CALIFORNIA. THE TWO
NEGATIVE FACTORS SHOULD CAUSE FURTHER WEAKENING. THE INTENSITY
FORECAST CALLS FOR GREG TO BE DISSIPATING BY 72 HOURS. THERE IS A
CHANCE IT COULD WEAKEN MORE RAPIDLY THAN FORECAST HERE.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS
MUCH CLOSER TO THE DEEP CONVECTION AND BETTER DEFINED. IN
ADDITION...SHIPS IN THE AREA INDICATE THAT PRESSURES ARE LOW ENOUGH
TO CLASSIFY THIS SYSTEM AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  THE OCEAN IS WARM
BUT UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE FAVORABLE FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING. THE
DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO BECOME A TROPICAL STORM WITHIN THE NEXT 12
TO 24 HOURS.

WE DO NOT HAVE A GOOD ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION BUT BEST
ESTIMATE IS 295/10. THIS GENERAL TRACK SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD AS INDICATED BY THE UK MODEL AS WELL AS CLIMATOLOGY.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS THE SYSTEM FAR ENOUGH FROM THE MEXICAN
COAST THAT WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.

THE CYCLONE IS STILL TRYING TO BECOME ORGANIZED AND SATELLITE
CLASSIFICATIONS INDICATE THAT IT IS NEARING THE THRESHOLD OF STORM
STRENGTH.  A STRONG BURST OF CONVECTION IS OCCURRING NEAR THE
ESTIMATED CENTER...BUT BANDING FEATURES ARE NOT YET WELL-DEFINED.
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS BEING RESTRICTED OVER THE NORTHEAST PORTION
OF THE SYSTEM...AND THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE
RATHER SLOW RATE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN RATHER SLOW THUS FAR.  SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST...AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND SIMILAR
TO THE SHIPS OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE.

SINCE THE CENTER IS NOT EASY TO FIND...THE MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS
UNCERTAIN BUT IT APPEARS TO BE JUST SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT AND A BIT
FASTER THAN IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS NOT
CHANGED MUCH.  THE LATEST GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS A 500 MB TROUGH
SOUTHWEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  IF THIS TROUGH IS DEEP ENOUGH...IT COULD PULL THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE MY TRACK.  THIS REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

PROBLEMS PROBLEMS! 06Z SATELLITE LOCATION FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB
CAME IN SOUTH AND EAST OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY POSITION. A 0140Z
TRMM OVERPASS SUGGESTS A MORE NORTHERLY POSITION...BUT IS VERY
AMBIGUOUS ON THE LONGITUDE. THUS...THE INITIAL POSITION IS VERY
UNCERTAIN. WHILE IT IS A BAD IDEA TO RE-LOCATED A PARTLY EXPOSED
CENTER BASED ON INFRARED IMAGERY...AN EXTRAPOLATED POSITION FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY DOES NOT SEEM TO FIT THE CLOUD PATTERN THAT WELL.
THUS...SOME ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY. IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IF
SOME RE-LOCATION IS NECESSARY WHEN VISIBLE IMAGERY BECOMES
AVAILABLE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN...WITH THE BEST ESTIMATE
295/3. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A RIDGE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.
LARGE SCALE MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES THIS RIDGE MAY WEAKEN AS AN
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BUILDS SOUTHWEST FROM CALIFORNIA. INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH...NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE DOES NOT SHOW A SIGNIFICANT
NORTHWARD TURN IN RESPONSE TO THE DEVELOPING TROUGH. INSTEAD...IT
CALLS FOR A NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS. WITH ALL THE
UNCERTAINTIES...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS LITTLE CHANGED FROM THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE...WITH ONLY SOME SOUTHWARD SHIFT FOR THE CURRENT
LOCATION.

ONE POSSIBLE PROBLEM WITH LOCATING THE CENTER IS THAT IT MAY BE
TRYING TO MOVE UNDER THE CONVECTIVE OVERCAST. A STRONG AND
PERSISTENT AREA OF CONVECTION...WITH TOPS TO -80C...IS WEST OR
SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER. THIS SHEAR PATTERN INDICATES THE SYSTEM IS
NEAR TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH. THE SHEAR APPEARS TO BE DECREASING...
AND IF THIS TREND CONTINUES THE SYSTEM WILL LIKELY REACH TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH LATER TODAY. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALL FOR
STRENGTHENING SIMILAR TO THE SHIPS MODEL.

SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON INDICATES THAT THE AREA
OF DISTURBED WEATHER OFF THE MEXICAN COAST NEAR MANZANILLO HAS
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND IS NOW A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  SATELLITE
CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB AND SABA ARE T2.5 SO THE DEPRESSION IS
VERY CLOSE TO TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST
MODEL SUGGESTS THAT THE DEPRESSION WILL BECOME A TROPICAL STORM
WITHIN 12 HOURS WITH MODEST ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING BEFORE COOLER
WATERS ARE ENCOUNTERED...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE SHIPS
GUIDANCE CLOSELY.

WITH ANY NEWLY-FORMED CIRCULATION THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN...
BUT BASED ON SATELLITE FIXES AND MEXICAN RADAR DATA THE INITIAL
MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 360/3.  ALL MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS AN
IMMEDIATE LEFT TURN KEEPING THE CYCLONE OFF THE MEXICAN COAST.  THE
CURRENT MOTION REQUIRES A TROPICAL STORM WATCH FOR A PORTION OF THE
COAST...AND A WARNING MAY BE REQUIRED IF THE NORTHWESTWARD TURN DOES
NOT MATERIALIZE SOON.

RADAR DATA FROM CUYUTLAN MEXICO CLEARLY REVEAL A TIGHT CENTER WITH
BANDING FEATURES.  THERE IS A CLUSTER OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER AND T-NUMBERS ARE 3.0 AND 2.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE.  BASED ON
THIS INFORMATION...THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION IS BEING UPGRADED TO
TROPICAL STORM IRWIN AT THIS TIME.  THERE IS SOME EASTERLY SHEAR
OVER THE SYSTEM...SO ONLY SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED BEFORE
IRWIN REACHES COOL WATERS IN 48 HOURS OR SO.

IRWIN HAS BEEN MOVING NORTHWARD BETWEEN 5 AND 8 KNOTS TOWARD THE
COAST OF MEXICO DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.  HOWEVER...GLOBAL MODELS
DEVELOP A STRONG RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES AND
NORTHERN MEXICO.  THIS PATTERN WOULD FORCE THE TROPICAL STORM ON A
MORE NORTHWEST MOTION SHORTLY AND THEN A WESTERLY TRACK DURING THE

IRWIN HAS DETERIORATED RAPIDLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS...WITH
THE DISSIPATION OF ALL DEEP CONVECTION.  LOW-LEVEL CLOUD MOTIONS
SUGGEST THAT A FEW WINDS OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE MAY STILL
EXIST...PRIMARILY NORTH OF THE CENTER.  SOCORRO ISLAND REPORTED A
PRESSURE OF 1005 MB AT 18Z...WITH A NORTHWEST WIND OF 12 KT. AT THAT
TIME THE CENTER OF IRWIN WAS ABOUT 15 NM NORTHEAST OF THE ISLAND. 

IRWIN NOW APPEARS TO BE MOVING WITH A SHALLOWER LAYER FLOW AND THE
INITIAL MOTION IS 255/9.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED SOUTH OF
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND IS CLOSE TO THE SHALLOW BAM.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT IRWIN WILL SPIN
DOWN ONLY VERY GRADUALLY AS IT LOSES ITS REMAINING TROPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT SUN OCT 10 1999

THE CENTER OF IRWIN MOVED VERY NEAR SOCORRO ISLAND WHICH REPORTED
WINDS OF 10 KNOTS AT 2100 UTC.  LOW-LEVEL CLOUD MOTIONS INDICATE
THAT WINDS ARE ABOUT 25 KNOTS AND THAT THE CIRCULATION IS BECOMING
DISORGANIZED AND ELONGATED.  IN ADDITION...THE SYSTEM IS DEVOID OF
DEEP CONVECTION.  THEREFORE...IRWIN IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO TROPICAL
DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME. 

THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE MOVING WEST OR SOUTH OF DUE
WEST...PRODUCING SPORADIC PATCHES OF THUNDERSTORMS UNTIL DISSIPATION
IN ABOUT 12 TO 24 HOURS.  THIS WILL BE THE LAST ADVISORY ON THIS
SYSTEM UNLESS REGENERATION OCCURS UNEXPECTEDLY.
