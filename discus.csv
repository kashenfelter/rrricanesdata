NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON JUL 27 1998

SHIP REPORTS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY INCLUDING SCATTEROMETER WINDS
INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM JUST OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA HAS A WELL-
DEFINED SURFACE CIRCULATION AND WE ARE IDENTIFYING IT AS TROPICAL
DEPRESSION NUMBER ONE.

TRACKING OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS GIVES A MOTION OF 280/24.  THE 00Z
AVIATION MODEL RUN SHOWS STEERING CURRENTS MUCH WEAKER THAN 24 KNOTS
SO THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS REDUCED TO 280/20.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE LITTLE CHANGE IN MOTION OVER THE NEXT 72
HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES ALONG WITH THIS.

THERE WERE THREE SHIPS AT 06Z IN THIS SYSTEM SHOWING A CLOSED
CIRCULATION OF ABOUT 15 KNOTS.  HOWEVER THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF
DEEP CONVECTION AND THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS ESTIMATED AT 25 KNOTS.

THE SHIPS STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL SHOWS THAT
CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING...SSTS ARE PLENTY
WARM AND THERE IS LITTLE VERTICAL SHEAR TO INHIBIT DEVELOPMENT.

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS SHOWS THAT WHILE
THE LOW LEVEL CENTER REMAINS FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED...CONVECTION HAS
DIMINISHED AROUND THE CENTER.  THUS...THE INTENSITY WILL BE
MAINTAINED AT 25 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION
OF THE SYSTEM IS RATHER IMPRESSIVE WITH GOOD OUTFLOW ESTABLISHED
OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS...AND CALLS FOR SOME GRADUAL STRENGTHENING THROUGH THE
PERIOD.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SHIPS STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL
INTENSITY MODEL. 

RECENT SATELLITE FIXES PLACE THE CENTER A BIT FURTHER NORTHWARD... 
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/18 KNOTS.  A MID-LEVEL
RIDGE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD KEEP IT ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK THROUGH ABOUT 48 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE AVIATION MODEL
BRINGS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROF/LOW SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR 40W.    
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST SHOWS A GRADUAL DECELERATION DUE TO 
THIS FEATURE.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE DISCUSSION NUMBER   3
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON JUL 27 1998

THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION HAS A LARGE BUT ELONGATED ENVELOPE AND IT
LACKS OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  SINCE THE DEPRESSION IS
OVER WARM WATERS...THE OUTFLOW IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND HAS SUCH A
LARGE ENVELOPE...I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT...TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING.  
HOWEVER... SINCE THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM IN 12 HOURS AND
SHIPS MODEL BRINGS THE SYSTEM TO 49 KNOTS...ONLY A SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. 

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON IR IMAGES AND THE
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/18.  ALL OF THE MODELS
THAT DEPEND ON THE AVN FORECAST FIELDS TURN THE DEPRESSION TO THE
NORTHWEST BY 48 HOURS.  THIS TURN IS CAUSED BY A DEVELOPING
MID-LEVEL TROUGH AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WHICH IS FORECAST BY THE AVN. 
ON THE OTHER HAND...THE UK AND NOGAPS MODELS MAINTAIN MORE OF A 500
MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THAT PATTERN WOULD
SUGGEST A WEST TO WEST NORTHWEST TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS TO THE LEFT OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE BUT VERY CLOSE TO CLIPER.
THERE IS TIME TO ADJUST THE FORECAST TRACK MORE TO THE
NORTHWEST...IF NECESSARY.  

NOGAPS TRACKING ALGORITHM DROPS THE DEPRESSION IN 12 HOURS OR SO 
BUT AN INSPECTION OF LOW-LEVEL FIELDS FROM THE 12Z RUN...ONE CAN
OBSERVE A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOVING DISTURBANCE WHICH APPROACHES
THE LESSER ANTILLES IN 5 DAYS OR SO.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE DISCUSSION NUMBER   4
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT TUE JUL 28 1998

THE DEPRESSION HAS NOT BECOME ANY BETTER ORGANIZED...AND THE CLOUD
PATTERN REMAINS ELONGATED FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING FROM NEAR 30N 20W
SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR 20N 30W...WHICH MAY BE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DISTORTION OF THE CLOUD PATTERN.  MOREOVER THE CYCLONE IS STILL 
INVOLVED WITH THE LOW-LEVEL MONSOONAL FLOW FEEDING TOWARDS WESTERN
AFRICA.  THE ABOVE TWO FACTORS MAY BE PREVENTING THE DEPRESSION FROM
STRENGTHENING AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
RUN SHOWS THE UPPER TROUGH MIGRATING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AND A MORE
ANTICYCLONIC FLOW BUILDING OVER THE AREA OF THE DEPRESSION.  ALSO AS
THE DEPRESSION MOVES FARTHER WEST IT SHOULD ESCAPE FROM THE MONSOON
TROUGH AND PERHAPS ENCOUNTER BETTER LOW-LEVEL INFLOW.  ONLY TIME
WILL TELL OF COURSE.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND CALLS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING...BUT ONE SHOULD
BEAR IN MIND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EXCEEDINGLY LIMITED SKILL IN
INTENSITY PREDICTION.

IT IS NOT EASY TO FIX A CENTER FROM INFRARED IMAGERY...BUT THE BEST
ESTIMATE IS THAT THE FORWARD MOTION HAS SLOWED A LITTLE MORE.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THAT FROM THE LAST ADVISORY
BUT SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THIS IS CLOSEST TO THE SHALLOW-LAYER STEERING.

IF THE SYSTEM WERE TO STRENGTHEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN
FORECAST...IT WOULD LIKELY TURN MORE NORTHWESTWARD IN RESPONSE TO
THE HIGHER-LEVEL TROUGH TO ITS NORTH.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/17...SAME AS LAST ADVISORY.  THE
00Z RUN OF THE AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE DEPRESSION TURNING TOWARD
THE NORTH-NORTHWEST IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS...APPARENTLY FINDING A
WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE.  THE UKMET SHOWS
MORE OF A WEST-NORTHEWESTWARD TRACK WHILE THE NOGAPS AND GFDL MODELS
LOSE THE CIRCULATION BY 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND
OF ALL OF THE GUIDANCE AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...
CALLING FOR A SLIGHT TURN TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND SOME
DECELERATION.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A FAIRLY-WELL ORGANIZED LOW LEVEL
CIRCULATION BUT THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED THIS MORNING. 
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE FROM T NUMBERS 2.0 TO 2.5.  THE
WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 30 KNOTS AND GRADUAL STRENGHENING IS
FORECAST AS THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF STRONG VERTICAL WIND SHEAR DURING

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/21 AND THIS IS SOMEWHAT FASTER
THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE
DEPRESSION TURNING TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHWEST INTO A WEAKNESS IN THE
SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE...THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME SCENARIO
AS THE 00Z MODEL RUN AND ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE
SIMILAR TO THE LAST PACKAGE.  SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY EXCEPT A LITTLE FASTER DURING THE
FIRST 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY CONSIDERABLE DECELERATION.  AS
BEFORE...THE GFDL AND NOGAPS MODELS LOSE THE CIRCULATION IN 24
HOURS.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A WELL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CLOUD STRUCTURE AND
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE AT MINIMAL TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH WHILE KGWC GAVE A 2.0 T NUMBER.   HOWEVER I PREFER TO
WAIT FOR THE APPEARANCE OF SOME MORE DEEP CONVECTION BEFORE
UPGRADING TO A TROPICAL STORM.  THE FORECAST...AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...IS FOR GRADUAL STRENGTHENING FOLLOWING THE SHIPS
STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL.  

THIS SYSTEM IS FAIRLY LARGE AND THE WIND SPEED RADII IN THE
FORECAST/ADVISORY ARE INCREASED A LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS BLOSSOMED A LITTLE THIS EVENING NEAR THE
CIRCULATION CENTER AND IN A BAND IN THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THIS
DEVELOPMENT...ALONG WITH TAFB AND SAB GIVING DVORAK TECHNIQUE
T-NUMBERS OF 2.5...SUPPORT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM
ALEX WITH 35 KT WINDS.  THE SPURT IN FORWARD SPEED NOTED EARLIER
TODAY SEEMS TO HAVE ENDED AND INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT
280/18 KT.
 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION WITH MULTIPLE
VORTICES TO THE NORTH TO NE OF THE TROPICAL STORM.  THE 12Z AVN
HAS THIS FEATURE PRIMARILY IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE...PERHAPS MOST
DISTINCT NEAR 300 MB.  AT 500 MB...IT SHOWS A WESTWARD RETROGRESSION
OF AN ANTICYCLONE FROM 35-40W TO 55-60W OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS...BUT
INDICATES THAT THE HIGH WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT ALEX
FROM GRADUALLY ACQUIRING A GREATER NORTHWARD COMPONENT.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT IDEA...AS IS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
WHICH IS A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.  FURTHER
DECELERATION IS ALSO PREDICTED.  ALTERNATELY...THE 12Z NOGAPS SHOWS
THE RETROGRADING HIGH TO BE STRONGER...AND KEEPS THE STORM AT FAIRLY
LOW LATITUDE...LOCATED ABOUT 200 NM SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST POINT AT
72 HOURS.
 
ALTHOUGH SOME MID-LEVEL MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE HEADING NORTHEASTWARD
AWAY FROM THE CENTER...MOST FACTORS INFLUENCING INTENSITY...AS
INDICATED BY THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST GUIDANCE...POINT TOWARD
STRENGTHENING.
 
A SHIP REPORT OF 10 KT 150 NM TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE SYSTEM AT 18Z
SUGGESTS THAT THE WIND RADII ARE NOT TOO LARGE AS YET...AT LEAST IN
THAT PART OF THE CIRCULATION.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT WED JUL 29 1998

DEEP CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED NEAR THE ESTIMATED CENTER...BUT THERE
ARE NO BANDING FEATURES EVIDENT AT THIS TIME.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 35 KNOTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM THE
TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THAT ALEX IS
MOVING INTO A COL IN THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW...SUGGESTING A WEAK SHEAR
ENVIRONMENT.  SO...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  THIS IS ALSO IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...GUIDANCE.  

ALTHOUGH THE CYCLONE APPEARS TO HAVE A LARGE CIRCULATION ENVELOPE...
CURRENTLY THE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION IS RELATIVELY SMALL.  THUS THE
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII ARE NOT ESTIMATED TO BE VERY LARGE
AT THIS TIME.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THERE IS QUITE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN THE
OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS.  DEEP LAYER STEERING FROM THE
AVIATION MODEL SHOWS A MORE NORTHWESTWARD COURSE DEVELOPING SOON. 
THIS APPEARS TO BE DUE TO MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL VORTICITY BEING DRAWN
SOUTHWESTWARD AHEAD OF ALEX...FROM A TROUGH THAT IS NOW NORTH OF THE
STORM.  HOWEVER THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS ALSO SHOW A STRONG MID-
TROPOSPHERIC HIGH NORTH OF 20N AND WEST OF 50W IN DAY OR TWO.  IF
THE ABOVEMENTIONED VORTICITY FEATURE IS NOT SO PROMINENT...THEN ALEX
MAY BE FORCED ON A MORE WESTWARD TRACK.  INDEED...THIS IS WHAT IS
SUGGESTED BY THE LATEST GFDL GUIDANCE.  FOR NOW...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SHIFTED ONLY SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES THIS MORNING SHOWS THAT THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER OF ALEX IS WEST OF THE LIMITED DEEP CONVECTION...AND THIS

ALEX IS MOVING INTO A COL IN THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW SUGGESTING A
WEAKER SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT ANALYSES
FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES.

THUS...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST WITH THE INTENSIFICATION TREND FROM
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY PRESERVED.    
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 280/17 KNOTS.  THE 12Z TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A BIT LESS SCATTER THAN EARLIER WITH MOST
INDICATING A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE AND A SLOWING IN FORWARD
SPEED BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE PRIMARY QUESTION REGARDING THE
TRACK FORECAST REMAINS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW NEAR
25N55W WHICH WOULD IMPART A MORE NORTHERLY COMPONENT OF MOTION.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS MADE A BIT OF A COMEBACK DURING THE DAY ALTHOUGH
IT IS NOT TERRIBLY WELL-ORGANIZED.  THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT IS
THAT THE CONVECTION IS FORMING CLOSER TO THE CENTER SUGGESTING THAT
ALEX IS MOVING INTO A LIGHTER VERTICAL SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  HOWEVER
...THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF OUTFLOW AND THE DRIER AIR NOTED IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WEST OF ALEX IS NOT CONDUCIVE FOR STRENGTHENING.
OVERALL...THE SYSTEM DOES NOT LOOK VERY HEALTHY AND THE CURRENT
INTENSITY IS HELD AT 35 KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL FORECAST TO
GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN WITH PROGRESSIVELY WARMER SST/S AHEAD AND
IMPROVING UPPER ENVIRONMENT. 

A NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHIC OFFICE DRIFTING BUOY LOCATED ABOUT 100 NM
WEST-NORTHWEST OF THE CENTER REPORTED A 10 METER/6 MINUTE WIND OF 
31 KNOTS AND A PRESSURE OF 1013 MB AT 18Z.  THIS IS CONSISTENT 
WITH OUR CURRENT TROPICAL STORM RADII.
  
THE CENTER HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO LOCATE DURING THE DAY. 
CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE SATELLITE FIXES SUGGEST THE CENTER IS A 
TAD SOUTH AND IS MOVING SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 275/14 KNOTS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A COMPLEX
UPPER AIR PATTERN OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  THE AVIATION MODEL
DEVELOPS A MID-TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
AS A RESULT...THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS SHOW A GENERAL
WESTERLY TRACK THROUGH 36 HOURS...FOLLOWED BY A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST
COURSE.  THE GFDL AND NOGAPS ARE THE SOUTHERN-MOST TRACKS.  WHILE
THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER FEATURES

SATELLITE PICTURES OF ALEX SHOW A LESS COHERENT PATTERN THAN 24
HOURS AGO.  DEEP CONVECTION IS LIMITED AND NOT WELL ORGANIZED AND
THE OVERALL CONFIGURATION...PARTICULARLY AT MID LEVELS...HAS BEEN
ELONGATED FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST BY AN INTERACTION WITH A
COMPLEX CYCLONIC CIRCULATION SEEN NEARBY IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.
THE INITIAL WIND SPEED FOR THIS ADVISORY IS AGAIN 35 KT.
 
ALEX IS MOVING JUST NORTH OF DUE WEST AT ABOUT 13 KT.  WHETHER ALEX
HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE LESSER ANTILLES DEPENDS ON HOW SOON AND
HOW MUCH THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH IS ERODED
WHEN THE LONGWAVE TROUGH ALONG THE EAST COAST IS REINFORCED.
YESTERDAY...THE 12Z NOGAPS SEEMED TO PROVIDE THE BEST GUIDANCE...
KEEPING A STRONGER HIGH TO THE NORTH AND A MORE WESTERLY TRACK THAN
SHOWN BY THE OTHER MODELS.  THERE IS A SIMILAR DIFFERENCE TODAY WITH
THE NEW 18Z AVN NOW ALSO SHOWING A PROLONGED WESTWARD HEADING...
THROUGH 36-48 HOURS.  IN DEFERENCE TO YESTERDAYS PARTIAL
VERIFICATION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
CLUSTER OF 12Z AVN-BASED TRACKS...BUT NOT AS FAR SOUTH AS THE
NOGAPS.
  
INTENSIFICATION IS STILL POSSIBLE AND THE GFDL AND SHIPS SCHEMES
BRING ALEX TO THE THRESHOLD OF HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 72 HOURS.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST ALSO SHOWS STRENGTHENING...BUT THIS IS POSTPONED
ABOUT A DAY...UNTIL THE PERIOD WHEN THE AVN SHOWS A SOMEWHAT MORE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

THE STORM CONTINUES TO LOOK LESS-ORGANIZED THAN IT DID 24 HOURS
AGO...AND MAXIMUM WIND ESTIMATE IS UNCHANGED FOR THIS ADVISORY. 
INFRARED IMAGERY SHOWS SOUTHERLY SHEARING OVER ALEX...ALTHOUGH WATER
VAPOR ANIMATION SUGGESTS FAIRLY WEAK SHEAR JUST AHEAD.  SINCE THE
SYSTEM HAS FAILED TO STRENGTHEN SIGNIFICANTLY THUS FAR...NO CHANGE
IS FORECAST FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS WITH ONLY A MODEST INCREASE
THEREAFTER.  THE SHIPS MODEL GIVES A SIMILAR INTENSITY FORECAST.

MOTION CONTINUES SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WEST AROUND 13 KT.  ACCORDING TO
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...A MID/UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE/VORTMAX IS
PREDICTED TO BE BETWEEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND ALEX IN 2-3 DAYS. 
THIS FEATURE...IF IT VERIFIES...WOULD INDUCE A MORE NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE LATEST NOGAPS RUN PAINTS A
SIMILAR PICTURE.  HOWEVER...THE 00Z GFDL MODEL RUN SHOWS A MORE
SOUTHERN TRACK.  IN DEFERENCE TO THE LATTER MODEL...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST ONLY BENDS THE TRACK TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST DURING THE
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS NHC
FORECAST.

11 AM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

THERE IS AN AREA OF CONCENTRATED CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND
CONSEQUENTLY THE DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE 3.0 FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.
THEREFORE...THE WINDS ARE ADJUSTED TO 45 KNOTS.  THE OUTFLOW IS
PARTIALLY RESTRICTED BUT IS ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM. THERE ARE
HOSTILE UPPER LEVEL WINDS AHEAD OF THE STORM...HOWEVER ...GLOBAL
MODELS SUGGEST THAT THESE WESTERLIES WILL WEAKEN OR RETROGRADE AND
THEN SOME SOUTHERLY SHEAR MAY DEVELOP. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS
FOR SOME STRENGTHENING SINCE THE GFDL AND SHIPS MODELS BRING THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE TO 65 TO 65 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.  ON THE LONGER
RANGE...4-5 DAYS... THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS BECOME A LITTLE MORE
FAVORABLE IN THE AREA BETWEEN PUERTO RICO AND BERMUDA.

ALEX IS CURRENTLY MOVING AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A WELL ESTABLISHED
DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE AT ABOUT 280/13.  THIS RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
HAVE A WEAKNESS ALONG 60-65 WEST. THIS WOULD INDUCE A TRACK MORE TO
THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
ON THIS TRACK...ALEX WOULD SKIRT THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS BUT
THEY STILL NEED TO MONITOR THIS STORM. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY
CLOSE TO THE GFDL BUT TO THE SOUTH OF MOST OF THE OTHER GUIDANCE.  

THE HIGH ALTITUDE NOOA JET IS SCHEDULED TO SAMPLE THE ENVIRONMENT
SURROUNDING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE LATE FRIDAY.

5 PM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

ALEX HAS MAINTAINED ITS DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER DURING THE
PAST SEVERAL HOURS WHILE THE OUTFLOW IS BECOMING A LITTLE BETTER
ORGANIZED.  HOWEVER...T-NUMBERS REMAIN ABOUT 3.0 SO THE WINDS ARE
KEPT AT 45 KNOTS AT THIS TIME. ALEX IS DEFINITIVELY BETTER ORGANIZED
THAN YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME. A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AHEAD OF THE STORM BUT IT WILL BE WEAK ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME
SLOW STRENGTHENING OF THE STORM.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS ALEX
TO A 65-KNOT HURRICANE BY 48 HOURS AS SUGGESTED BY THE GFDL AND
SHIPS MODELS.  ON THE LONGER RANGE...4-5 DAYS... THE UPPER LEVEL
WINDS BECOME A LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE IN THE AREA BETWEEN PUERTO RICO
AND BERMUDA.

MOST OF THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE SAME SCENARIO. A WELL
ESTABLISHED DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE WHICH IS FORECAST TO HAVE A
WEAKNESS ALONG 60-65 WEST.  THIS PATTERN WOULD INDUCE A TRACK MORE
TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  ON THIS TRACK...THE CORE OF ALEX WOULD SKIRT THE NORTHERN
LEEWARD ISLANDS AS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH IN FACT
IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL.

LONG RANGE MODELS ARE DEVELOPING A LARGE TROUGH ALONG EAST COAST OF
THE UNITED STATES.  IF THIS VERFIES...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL TAKE
A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC.

11 PM EDT THU JUL 30 1998
 
ALEX IS GENERATING A CENTRAL AREA OF INTENSE CONVECTION WITH A
FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL HIGH-LEVEL OUTFLOW.  AT AN INTERMEDIATE
LEVEL...HOWEVER...THERE REMAINS A DISTINCT SSW CURRENT ACROSS THE
STORM ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AHEAD OF THE STORM.  THIS IS
JUST ONE PART OF A COMPLICATED CIRCULATION ALOFT THAT INCLUDES A
WELL-DEFINED VORTEX SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO
THE NORTHWEST OF ALEX.  THE AVN MODEL SHOWS THAT VORTEX AT 300-500
MB.  

THE INTENSE OUTFLOW AT CIRRUS LEVEL HAS OBSCURED THE CENTRAL
FEATURES...MAKING POSITIONING SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULT.  ANALYSES
FROM TAFB...SAB..AND AFWA...HOWEVER...INDICATE THAT A HEADING TOWARD
THE WNW HAS BEGUN...PERHAPS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOW DEEP ENOUGH TO
RESPOND MORE TO THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW IN ITS ENVIRONMENT.  THE MOTION
IS ESTIMATED AT 290/11 KT.  WIND SPEED IS NEAR 45 KT.
 
THE PATTERN ALOFT IS FORECAST TO REMAIN COMPLEX...WITH THE AVN
KEEPING A VORTEX TO THE NW-N OF ALEX THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS
IS INTERPRETED AS A GENERAL WEAKNESS IN THE HEIGHT PATTERN THAT
SHOULD ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN THE NORTHWARD COMPONENT.  THE
RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE FEATURES WILL PROBABLY INFLUENCE HOW
SMOOTH THE TRANSITION IN TRACK WILL BE.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS
LITTLE DIVERSITY.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NEAR THE CENTER OF THE
CLUSTER OF MODEL TRACKS AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE 18 AVN AND 12Z
NOGAPS FORECASTS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS 6 HOURS AGO.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON INFRARED IMAGERY AS A LARGE
CDO TYPE FEATURE IS OBSCURING THE LOWER CLOUDS.  TAFB AND SAB ARE
OVER 60 NMI APART IN THEIR 0545Z POSITION ESTIMATES.  THE OFFICIAL
INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION...290/11...MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE POSITION IS NEAR THE SOUTHWEST EDGE OF THE
DEEP CONVECTION SUGGESTING SOME SOUTHERLY VERTICAL SHEAR.  IF THE
CENTER IS ACTUALLY EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION...ALEX COULD
BE STRONGER THAN WE ARE ESTIMATING AND ALSO MOVING WITH MORE OF A
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.

THE TRACK MODELS ARE ALL CLOSELY CLUSTERED AND SHOW A MOSTLY
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS...MOVING INTO A WEAKNESS
IN THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE AND IS SIMILAR AND AN UPDATE TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.

THE INITIAL AND FORECAST INTENSITY ARE THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS

RELOCATED TO THE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS POSITION.  GLOBAL MODELS ARE

PERSIST FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME...AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RELAX
UNTIL 72 HOURS.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS 45 KNOTS AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR NO CHANGE AT THIS TIME. MOREOVER... WEAKENING MAY
BE INDICATED IN THE NEXT ADVISORY IF THIS TREND CONTINUES.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 270/10.  THE STEERING PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED AND
IF ALEX SURVIVES...IT IS EXPECTED TO TURN MORE TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST AS INDICATED BY MOST OF THE MODELS.  IF ALEX
BECOMES COMPLETELY EXPOSED AND WEAKENS FURTHER... THE SYSTEM COULD
MOVE MORE TO THE WEST.  HOWEVER...UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES HAVE BECOME

YESTERDAY...WE FORECAST THAT ALEX WAS GOING TO REACH HURRICANE
STATUS IN ABOUT 48 HOURS.  INSTEAD...STRONG SOUTHERLY UPPER-LEVEL
WINDS HIT THE STORM REMOVING MOST OF THE CONVECTION FROM THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER AND CONSEQUENTLY...WEAKENING HAS OCCURRED.  THIS
WEAKENING WAS NOT INDICATED BY ANY OF THE AVAILABLE TOOLS AND
REFLECTS HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT FORECASTING INTENSITY CHANGES.
AFTER THE FACT....IT IS SOMETIMES EASY TO FIND AN EXPLANATION.

IT APPEARS THAT THE WIND SHEAR WILL PERSIST SO WEAKENING SHOULD
CONTINUE AND ALEX COULD BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION
TONIGHT OR SATURDAY.   INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 35
KNOTS AND WINDS ARE KEPT AT 30 KNOTS THROUGH 72 HOURS.  

NOW THAT WE CAN SEE THE LOW LEVEL CENTER...WE HAVE A BETTER ESTIMATE
OF THE INITIAL MOTION WHICH IS 280/10.  A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED OF WHATEVER IS LEFT OF ALEX.
HOWEVER...IF IT BECOMES AN OPEN WAVE THE SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY
PROPAGATE WESTWARD SPREADING SHOWERS AND SQUALLS.

ALEX IS STILL GENERATING A FEW CLUSTERS OF DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE
NORTHERN PART OF ITS CIRCULATION AND...AS SUGGESTED BY DVORAK
TECHNIQUE ANALYSES...THE SYSTEM IS PROBABLY STILL A TROPICAL STORM.
ESTIMATED WINDS ARE 35 KT.  DATA FROM THE NOAA HIGH-ALTITUDE JET
SEEMS TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL SHEARING
PATTERN MAINLY BELOW ALEX/S CIRRUS CANOPY LEVEL.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/11 KT.  TRACK FORECASTING BECOMES MORE
DIFFICULT THAN USUAL WHEN...LIKE NOW...IT IS ALSO TIED TO A HIGHLY
UNCERTAIN INTENSITY FORECAST.  THERE APPEAR TO BE THREE PRIMARY
POSSIBILITIES.  FIRST...IF THE SHEAR SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTEDLY DECREASES
THEN ALEX COULD STRENGTHEN AND TURN MORE TOWARD THE WNW OR NW...
DIMINISHING ANY THREAT TO THE CARIBBEAN.  SECOND...ALEX COULD WEAKEN
FURTHER OR DISSIPATE WITH ITS REMNANTS MOVING NEARLY WESTWARD...
AGAIN HAVING MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE CARIBBEAN.  THIRD...THE SYSTEM
COULD REMAIN MUCH AS IT IS...UNIMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE PICTURES...
BUT A POTENTIAL PRODUCER OF SOME HEAVY RAIN AND THE POSSIBILITY OF
LOCAL FLOODING AND HIGH WIND GUSTS FOR THE LEEWARD ISLANDS HAVING
HIGH TERRAIN.
 
WITH SHEAR EXPECTED TO PERSIST...THE SECOND SCENARIO MIGHT BE THE
MOST LIKELY.  HOWEVER...PARTLY TO BE CAUTIONS...THE CURRENT FORECAST
HAS A LITTLE MORE OF AN INKLING OF THE THIRD POSSIBILITY THAN WE
HAVE INDICATED PREVIOUSLY.  THE TRACK IS SHIFTED TO THE LEFT A
LITTLE AND IF THIS TREND IS OBSERVED OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS
...SOME CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO ISSUING A TROPICAL
STORM WATCH OR WARNING FOR A PORTION OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS ON
SATURDAY.  THE NHC TRACK IS BETWEEN BAMS AND CLIPER...WHICH FORM THE

MAINTAINED AS A MINIMUM TROPICAL STORM...35 KNOTS... FOR THIS

IN ITS WEAKEN STATE ALEX/S MOTION IS BEING CONTROLLED BY LOW-LEVEL
TROPOSPHERIC STEERING...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 275/12
KNOTS.  AS STATED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY THE TRACK AND INTENSITY
FORECASTS FOR ALEX ARE INTERTWINED. DATA FROM THE G-IV HIGH-ALTITUDE
JET AIRCRAFT MISSION FRIDAY AFTERNOON REVEALED 30-40 KNOT SOUTH/
SOUTHWEST WINDS BETWEEN 200 AND 250 MB IN THE VICINITY OF THE
SYSTEM.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW ABOUT
11 DEG NW OF ALEX HELPING TO BACK THE FLOW OVER THE EASTERN
CARIBBEAN.  SO...THE SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST.  IF THE SHEAR DID RELAX ALEX COULD STRENGTHEN
AND TURN MORE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST... AND MOST OF THE TRACK
MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS THIS SCENARIO.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A LESS
PLAUSIBLE POSSIBILITY.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING THROUGH
24 HOURS WITH A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST THEN NORTHWEST TRACK THEREAFTER.

THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS IN CLOSE
AGREEMENT WITH BAM SHALLOW.  WITH THE VERTICAL WIND SHEAR EXPECTED

STORM FORCE WINDS WERE OBSERVED BY THE FLIGHT CREW...BUT ONLY IN THE
THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS NORTH OF THE NOW ALMOST ENTIRELY EXPOSED
LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  THE SUSTAINED WINDS ARE LIKELY NOW AT MOST 45 KT. 
INITIAL MOTION IS NEAR 300/13 KT.
 
THE FUTURE TRACK AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALEX ARE COMPLICATED BY A
FRACTURED CIRCULATION PATTERN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WITH
ANOTHER LOW-LEVEL VORTEX TO THE WNW OF ALEX AND WITH SOME MODELS
INDICATING THAT YET ANOTHER LOW WILL DEVELOP FROM THE BAROCLINIC
ZONE ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST.  ALOFT...A LARGE AND PERSISTENT
CYCLONIC CIRCULATION IS NOTED.  REMARKABLY...THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS
RELATIVELY UNIFORM...SUGGESTING A WNW TO NW TRACK THROUGH 48 HOURS. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THOSE TRACKS AND
SIMILAR TO THE GFDL.
  
ALEX/S INTENSITY WILL BE PARTLY A FUNCTION OF HOW IT NEGOTIATES A
TRACK AROUND...OR THROUGH...THE UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATION. 
WITHOUT HAVING A GOOD HANDLE ON HOW THAT INTERACTION WILL PLAY
OUT...THE CURRENT FORECAST WILL SHOW NO CHANGE IN WIND SPEED.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
STORM.  ALEX REMAINS IN A SHEARED STATE WITH THE CENTER LOCATED TO
THE SOUTH OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN
UPPER LEVEL LOW NEAR 25N64W WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SOUTH-
SOUTHWESTERLY SHEARING.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THE
SYSTEM HAS DROPPED BELOW STORM STRENGTH...BUT WE WILL WAIT FOR THE
AIR FORCE RECON LATER TODAY TO CONFIRM THIS.  SINCE THERE IS STILL A
SLIM POSSIBILITY THAT UPPER-LEVEL CONDITIONS COULD BECOME LESS
HOSTILE FOR STRENGTHENING...AS INDICATED BY MODELS SUCH AS THE
STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS THE WINDS AT 35 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

ALEX HAS TURNED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT AND IS NOW MOVING AT AN
ESTIMATED 310/11.  THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST IS TO THE RIGHT OF
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND NEAR THE CONSENSUS OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACKS. 
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB LOW NEAR THE SOUTH CAROLINA
COAST WITH A HIGH CENTERED JUST EAST OF BERMUDA IN 2-3 DAYS.  THIS
SUPPORTS A CONTINUED NORTHWESTWARD...PERHAPS MORE NORTH-
NORTHWESTWARD... MOVEMENT OF ALEX.

THE STRONG TROPICAL WAVE TO THE EAST OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS HAS
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY...AS THE CLOUD PATTERN BECAME MORE
CONSOLIDATED OVER THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE SYSTEM.  LOW CLOUD
MOTIONS AND SHIP REPORTS SHOW A CLOSED SURFACE CIRCULATION WHICH IS
SOMEWHAT ELONGATED ALONG A NORTHWEST-SOUTHEAST AXIS.   UPPER-LEVEL
WINDS...SUCH AS THOSE ANALYZED BY THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES ON THE INTERNET...APPEAR MOSTLY
FAVORABLE OVER THE AREA...ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION OF
SLIGHT SOUTHERLY SHEAR OVER THE DEPRESSION.  THE STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...INDICATES STEADY
STRENGTHENING...BUT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT MORE
CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE OF THE CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN INTENSITY
FORECASTING. 

THE CURRENT POSITION...WHICH SUGGESTS A MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION
COMPARED TO THE EARLIER CENTER FIXES...PARTIALLY REPRESENTS A
REFORMATION OF THE CENTER AS THE CYCLONE ORGANIZES.  OUR BEST
INITIAL MOVEMENT ESTIMATE IS 295/17 AND OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE IS IN
REASONABLE AGREEMENT ON A CONTINUATION OF THIS MOTION FOR THE NEXT
FEW DAYS.  THIS LOOKS REASONABLE SINCE THE NUMERICAL MODELS ALSO
SHOW A MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.

LAST LIGHT VISIBLE PICTURES SUGGESTED THAT THE CENTER REMAINS BROAD

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER POSITION IS JUST SOUTHEAST OF A CURRENT BURST
OF DEEP CONVECTION.  THE CENTER MAY BE TRYING TO RE-DEVELOP CLOSER

AGREEMENT...ALTHOUGH THE USUAL UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH INFRARED

GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS
BEEN ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND

DEEP CONVECTION IS GRADUALLY BECOMING MORE CONCENTRATED NEAR THE
ESTIMATED CIRCULATION CENTER AND DIMINISHING ALONG THE PREVIOUSLY
NOTED AXIS EXTENDING TOWARD THE SE.  WHILE THIS IMPLIES AN IMPROVING
ORGANIZATION...DVORAK T-NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN AT
2.0...JUST BELOW TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR IS
OFTEN THE NEMESIS OF ATLANTIC TROPICAL CYCLONES.  IN THIS CASE...THE
SYSTEM HAS A REMARKABLY PROMINENT OUTFLOW ALOFT WITH...IF ANYTHING
...SOUTHEASTERLY SHEAR.  THE FORECAST ENVIRONMENT AHEAD IS FAVORABLE
FOR STRENGTHENING AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE NHC FORECAST WHICH
SHOWS AN INTENSIFICATION RATE APPROXIMATING THAT OF THE SHIP/S
SCHEME.
 
THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH IS EXPECTED TO KEEP THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE ON A WNW HEADING FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS WITH THE STRONG
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH NOW ALONG THE EAST COAST SWINGING OFFSHORE AND
LIKELY BYPASSING THE SYSTEM.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE AND OFFICIAL
FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY ARE BASED ON THIS SEQUENCE.
 
BEGINNING AROUND 48 HOURS...THE LARGE-SCALE MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE
MARKEDLY.  WHEN A SECOND SHORT-WAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE
COAST...THE 00Z AVN AND NOGAPS TURN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE NORTHWARD
AROUND THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE HIGH...BETWEEN 66-70W.  THIS IS
SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS RUNS FROM THOSE MODELS.  THE GFDL...ON THE OTHER
HAND...MAINTAINS A MID-LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDING WESTWARD FROM THE HIGH
TO THE GULF OF MEXICO BETWEEN 25-30N.  THIS KEEPS THE SYSTEM ON A
WNW TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS...ENDING UP SOME 500 NM SOUTHWEST OF THE
OTHER GUIDANCE.  THIS GFDL TRACK IS A LITTLE NORTH OF ITS TRACK 6
HOURS AGO.  THE NHC TRACK IS NORTH OF THE GFDL...ON THE SOUTHERN
EDGE OF THE REMAINING GUIDANCE...AND CLOSE TO OUR PREVIOUS TRACKS.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE DEPRESSION IS FAIRLY WELL
ORGANIZED...AND MAY BE A TROPICAL STORM.  WE WILL AWAIT THE AIR
FORCE RECON OBSERVATIONS LATER TODAY TO SEE IF WE SHOULD NAME THE
SYSTEM.  THE ANTICYLONIC OUTFLOW IS VERY IMPRESSIVE OVER THE
NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE AND RAWINSONDE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE
NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN SHOW NO HIGH LEVEL WESTERLIES TO IMPEDE
DEVELOPMENT.  SO...STRENGTHENING IS PREDICTED AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.
 
THE CYCLONE WAS APPARENTLY MOVING FASTER OVERNIGHT THAN EARLIER
REPORTED AND HAS BEEN RELOCATED FARTHER TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST.
MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 290/20.  THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A BROAD
TROUGH AT 500 MB MOVING OFF THE NORTHEAST U.S. COAST IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS AND THIS SHOULD PARTIALLY BREAK DOWN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OVER
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  CONSEQUENTLY MOST OF THE TRACK PREDICTION
MODELS TURN THE CYCLONE TO THE NORTHWEST AND SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED
LATER IN THE PERIOD...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  HOWEVER WE ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORE WESTWARD TRACK SINCE THE
STATE-OF-THE-ART  GFDL MODEL DOES NOT SHOW MUCH OF A NORTHWARD
TREND.
 
THE NOAA G-4 JET AND BOTH NOAA P-3 PLANES WILL FLY A SYNOPTIC

THE HURRICANE HUNTERS FOUND FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS TO 61 KNOTS TO THE

UPGRADING T.D. TWO TO TROPICAL STORM BONNIE. ALTHOUGH THE STORM HAS
A WELL-ORGANIZED APPEARANCE IN SATELLITE IMAGERY...ITS RAPID FORWARD
TRANSLATIONAL SPEED IS APPARENTLY DISTORTING THE WIND FIELD NEAR THE
CENTER.  THE ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT REMAINS FAVORABLE FOR CONTINUED
STRENGTHENING AND INTENSIFICATION IS EVEN MORE LIKELY IF THE FORWARD
SPEED SLOWS SOMEWHAT...AS FORECAST.
 
BONNIE HAS BEEN TRACKING SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST TODAY...BUT
PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS EXCEPT THE GFDL SHOW
A SIGNIFICANT TURN TO THE RIGHT.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH A
BREAKDOWN OF THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AS
SHOWN BY THE GLOBAL MODELS.  NOTWITHSTANDING...OUT OF RESPECT FOR
WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE OUR MOST RELIABLE GUIDANCE...THE GFDL...WE
ARE KEEPING THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE
ENSEMBLE.
 
SINCE THE FORECAST TRACK IS RATHER CLOSE TO THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND
PUERTO RICO...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS AND WATCHES HAVE BEEN ISSUED
FOR THESE AREAS.  HOWEVER AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT THE STRONG
WINDS ARE RESTRICTED MAINLY TO THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE OF BONNIE.

WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE RECON IN THE AREA UNTIL OOZ TONIGHT.
EARLIER FIXES INDICATE THAT BONNIE HAS BEEN MOVING ABOUT 290/15.
MINIMUM PRESSURE IS ESTIMATED AT 999 MB.  SATELLITE SUGGESTS THAT
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED WITH
DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND EXCELLENT OUTFLOW. BOTH SHIPS
AND THE GFDL SUGGEST THAT BONNIE COULD REACH 100 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS
AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.
 
THE BIG DILEMMA IS WHETHER OR NOT THE TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO
DEVELOP ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL
STEER BONNIE NORTHWARD.  IN ANY CASE THE STEERING FLOW IS FORECAST
TO WEAKEN WHICH WOULD SLOW BONNIE DOWN. NOGAPS BRINGS BONNIE CLOSER
TO THE COAST THAN IN PREVIOUS RUNS IN THE MEDIUM RANGE AND THE
LATEST GFDL MAINTAINS A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...AS IN PREVIOUS FORECAST...CONTINUES VERY CLOSE TO THE

BONNIE CONTINUES TO LOOK STRONGER ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...WITH A VERY
COLD TOPPED CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST AND INCREASED BANDING FEATURES
OVER THE NORTH AND WEST QUADRANTS.  RECON RECENTLY FOUND A 991 MB
CENTRAL PRESSURE AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 60 KNOTS.
THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW STILL LOOKS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  BONNIE COULD BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE
WITHIN THIS FORECAST PERIOD.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/15.  THE DYNAMICAL MODELS INDICATE
THAT THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF BONNIE WILL BREAK DOWN
LATER IN THIS FORECAST PERIOD WHICH SHOULD SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED
AND EVENTUALLY RESULT IN A MORE NORTHWARD TRACK.  THE TIMING OF THIS
NORTHWARD MOTION...OF COURSE...IS CRITICAL.  OUR CURRENT TRACK LEANS
TOWARD THE LEFT OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE AND IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH
THE GFDL.  IT IS NOTED THAT THE UKMET...NAVY NOGAPS...AND AVN ARE
CONSISTENTLY TO THE RIGHT OF OUR TRACK.
 
BONNIE COULD STILL BE A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE EAST U.S. COAST
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  WE ARE INSERTING A STATEMENT TO THE
EFFECT ...RESIDENTS WITHIN THIS AREA SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
BONNIE AT THIS TIME.
 
THE NOAA HIGH ALTITUDE JET AND BOTH NOAA P3 AIRCRAFT ARE FLYING A

ON THEIR LAST PASS THROUGH BONNIE NEAR 0530Z...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS
FOUND THAT A NEARLY COMPLETE EYEWALL HAD FORMED.  THEY ALSO REPORTED
A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 987 MB WITH FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 76 KT.
SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT 65 KT.  THE
MOTION HAS EDGED OVER TO 300 DEGREES...STILL AT 15 KNOTS.
 
NOAA AIRCRAFT HAVE ONCE AGAIN PROVIDED THE NUMERICAL MODELS NUMEROUS
VERTICAL SOUNDINGS OF BONNIE/S ENVIRONMENT TO IMPROVE FORECASTS OF
TRACK AND INTENSITY.  THE RESULTING GUIDANCE AND OUR CONCERNS ARE
LITTLE CHANGED.  THE LARGE-SCALE MODELS SHOW A WEAKENING OF STEERING
CURRENTS DURING THE NEXT TWO DAYS...FOLLOWED BY THE APPROACH OF A
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES WHICH COULD INDUCE A GREATER
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS SIMILAR TO 6
HOURS AGO SHOWING A GRADUAL TURN FROM WNW TO NW AND DECELERATION
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  THE GFDL TRACK AGAIN FORMS THE LEFT EDGE OF
THE ENSEMBLE...BUT ALL THE GFDL 72-HOUR FORECAST POSITIONS FOR
BONNIE HAVE ENDED UP LEFT OF THE ACTUAL TRACK.  THE NHC FORECAST IS
TO THE RIGHT OF GFDL...NEAR LBAR WHICH HAS HAD LITTLE LATERAL
BIAS...AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS TRACK.
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BAHAMAS HAS ISSUED A HURRICANE WARNING FOR THE

FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT BONNIE
IS RIGHT ON TRACK...300/14.  THERE IS NO APPARENT CHANGE IN THE BOTH
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING BONNIE.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE LOCATED
TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE HURRICANE WILL DRIVE THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE THAT THE RIDGE WILL WEAKEN...
ALLOWING BONNIE TO TURN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH. THE GFDL
MAKES A MORE GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST WITH A DECREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONTINUES VERY CLOSE TO THE
GFDL BUT REFLECTING THE CONSENSUS FOR A MORE NORTHWARD TURN BEYOND
36 HOURS.
 
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DROPPED TO 980 MB SUGGESTING THAT
STRENGTHENING IS OCCURRING. SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD

ALL CURRENT AVAILABLE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT BONNIE SHOULD TURN MORE
TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.
THIS TURN IS ALSO FORECAST BY OUR STATE OF THE ART GFDL MODEL. THIS
LESSENS ANY POSSIBLE THREAT OF LANDFALL IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA.
HOWEVER...ONE SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
BONNIE UNTIL THE EXPECTED TURN MATERIALIZES.  ON THE OTHER
HAND...THE POTENTIAL THREAT FROM CENTRAL FLORIDA NORTHWARD ALONG THE
EAST COAST REMAINS. 

BONNIE HAS SLOWED DOWN...AS FORECAST BY THE GFDL...AND THE INITIAL
MOTION IS 300/11.  THERE IS ENOUGH RIDGING TO THE NORTH TO MAINTAIN
THIS GENERAL TRACK THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A SLOW
TURN TO THE NORTHWEST IS FORECAST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AGAIN
VERY CLOSE TO THE GFDL AND BIT TO THE LEFT OF THE OTHER MODELS. 

NOTE: LATEST NOGAPS KEEPS THE HURRICANE ON A GENERAL NORTHWEST TO
NORTH-NORTHWEST TRACK AND BRINGS THE CENTER OF BONNIE NEAR THE SOUTH
CAROLINA COAST BY EARLY WEDNESDAY. THIS IS ALSO INDICATED BY THE
MEDIUM RANGE VERSION OF THE GFDL.  

LATEST RECON DATA SHOWS THAT THE WINDS ARE 80 KNOTS AND MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE REMAINS AT 977 MB. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAKES
BONNIE A CATEGORY 3 ON THE SAFFIR SIMPSON-SCALE AS INDICATED IN THE

THE LAST AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 959 MB...A 3 MB DECREASE SINCE 03Z AND AN 18 MB FALL IN
THE LAST 10 HOURS...AND A 25 NMI CIRCULAR EYE.  THE FLIGHT-LEVEL
WINDS HAVE NOW INCREASED WITH A MAXIMUM WIND OF 102 KNOTS RECORDED
IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 
90 KNOTS.  THE SATELLITE PRESENTATION REMAINS IMPRESSIVE WITH A
SYMMETRIC RING OF -75C TOPS SURROUNDING THE EYE AND EXCELLENT
OUTFLOW.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR FURTHER STRENGTHENING
ALONG THE LINES OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

RECONNAISSANCE POSITION FIXES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS INDICATE
THAT THE MOTION OF BONNIE HAS BEEN SLOW AND ERRATIC.  THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE BASED ON THE LAST 6 HOURS IS 310/06 KNOTS.  AS HAS
BEEN THE CASE IN THE LAST SEVERAL ADVISORIES...THE FUTURE TRACK OF
BONNIE IS HINGED ON THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RIDGE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM. 
THE SYSTEM SHOULD TURN MORE TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST AND NORTH DURING
THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS...STEERED...IN PART...AROUND THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE TO THE EAST.  A TROUGH
CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL U.S. IS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE
NORTHEAST U.S. IN THE NEXT 36 TO 48 HOURS WHICH MAY HELP TURN BONNIE
MORE NORTHWARD.  THE AVIATION SHOWS THIS TROUGH MOVING FAR ENOUGH
SOUTH TO PULL BONNIE NORTH WHILE THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL INDICATES
THAT THE TROUGH STAYS SUFFICIENTLY NORTH TO ALLOW A MORE NORTHWEST
MOTION.  

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
AND IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL...AND SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE
UKMET.   NOGAPS MODEL IS THE LEFT-MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.   ALTHOUGH
THIS TRACK LESSENS THE THREAT OF LANDFALL IN FLORIDA...INTERESTS IN

11 AM EDT SUN AUG 23 1998

EVEN THOUGH THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW TO THE WEST IS CURRENTLY BEING
IMPEDED A BIT...BONNIE HAS CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN.  A HURRICANE
HUNTER PLANE IS FINDING WINDS OF AT LEAST 100 KNOTS AT THE 700 MB
LEVEL...AND WINDS AT 850 MB ARE PROBABLY HIGHER.  ON SATELLITE...
BONNIE HAS A CLASSICAL APPEARENCE.  THE COLD-TOPPED DENSE OVERCAST
SURROUNDING THE EYE HAS GROWN IN SIZE.  CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE
IS 100 KNOTS...MAKING BONNIE A MAJOR HURRICANE.  SOME FURTHER
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR.  

RECON AND SATELLITE FIXES YIELD LITTLE MOTION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
HOURS...SO THE GUIDANCE MODELS WERE INITIALIZED WITH A FORWARD
MOTION OF ZERO.  THE RESULTING OBJECTIVE TRACK FORECASTS ARE HIGHLY
DIVERGENT...WITH 72 HOUR PREDICTIONS RANGING FROM NEAR THE CAROLINA
COAST TO WELL OFFSHORE OF THE U.S. EAST COAST.  THE STEERING PATTERN
IS BY NO MEANS STRAIGHTFORWARD.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THAT A
WEAK MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS CURRENTLY IN THE VICINITY OF
BONNIE... AND HAS PROBABLY CAUSED THE STALLING OF THE HURRICANE.  IT
APPEARS THAT THIS TROUGH WILL BYPASS BONNIE...THEREFORE A SLOW
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION IS FORECAST TO RESUME.   WATER VAPOR WINDS FROM
THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS SUGGESTS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE
EXTENDING EASTWARD FROM NEAR THE FLORIDA-GEORGIA BORDER INTO THE
ATLANTIC FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES...AND THIS COULD PREVENT A TURN
AWAY FROM THE COAST IF IT PERSISTS.  THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER
ANOTHER UPSTREAM TROUGH...CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTH-CENTRAL U.S.
...WILL EVENTUALLY PULL BONNIE AWAY FROM THE COAST.  ALL INTERESTS
ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. SHOULD MAINTAIN THEIR VIGILANCE AND
MONITOR FUTURE ADVISORIES. 

ANOTHER MULTI-AIRCRAFT MISSION INVOLVING AIRCRAFT FROM BOTH NOAA AND
NASA WILL PROVIDE EXTENSIVE SAMPLING OF THE STEERING ENVIRONMENT
TODAY.  THEIR DATA SHOULD HELP IMPROVE THE INITIALIZATION AND BRING

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SUN AUG 23 1998

AFTER DRIFTING TO THE NORTH EARLIER TODAY...BONNIE APPEARS TO NOW BE
MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWESTWARD.  THE INFLUENCE OF THE MID- TO UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH...THAT LIKELY INDUCED THE NORTHWARD NUDGE OF THE
HURRICANE...NOW APPEARS TO BE LESSENING AS IT BY PASSES BONNIE.  WE
ARE NOW FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF THE FUTURE COURSE OF THIS
HURRICANE.  THE PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT SOME OF OUR
BEST TRACK PREDICTION MODELS HAVE SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE LEFT
AS COMPARED TO THIS MORNING.  LOOKING AT SOME OF THE MODEL
FIELDS...THERE IS NOW A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT BONNIE COULD BE
TRAPPED BENEATH A NARROW RIDGE ALONG ABOUT 36N LATITUDE OR SO.  IF
THIS IS THE CASE...BONNIE COULD REACH THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST NEAR
THE END OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.

THE EYE HAS BECOME INDISTINCT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.  SINCE BONNIE
HAS BEEN DWELLING OVER THE SAME GENERAL AREA MOST OF TODAY...IT MAY
HAVE COOLED THE SURFACE WATERS UNDERNEATH IT AND THIS MAY HAVE
TEMPORARILY BRAKED THE STRENGTHENING TREND.  ANOTHER INHIBITING
FACTOR MAY HAVE THE ABOVEMENTIONED TROUGH.  HOWEVER THE HURRICANE
HAS A MASSIVE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW OVER ALL BUT THE
NORTHWEST QUADRANT.  ALSO...THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DIURNAL
FLUCTUATIONS WHEREIN THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN STRENGTHENING MORE DURING
THE NIGHTTIME HOURS THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...AND BECOMING A LITTLE
LESS ORGANIZED AROUND MIDDAY.  SOME FURTHER INCREASE IN INTENSITY IS
CERTAINLY POSSIBLE DURING THE PERIOD.

ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. SHOULD MAINTAIN THEIR
VIGILANCE AND MONITOR FUTURE ADVISORIES.  WE HAVE INSERTED A
STATEMENT INTO THE ADVISORY THAT A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE REQUIRED
FOR A PORTION OF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST ON MONDAY
 
ANOTHER MULTI-AIRCRAFT MISSION INVOLVING AIRCRAFT FROM BOTH NOAA AND

AIR FORCE RESERVE AIRCRAFT FIXES SHOW THAT THE MOTION IS STILL SLOW
AND ERRATIC.  THE PAST 12 HOUR MOTION IS 320/04 AND THIS WILL BE
USED AS THE INITIAL MOTION.
 
THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS FASCINATING.  THE GFDL MODEL HAS CHANGED
DRAMATICALLY FROM THE PREVIOUS RUN.  INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SOUTH
CAROLINA IN 72 HOURS...THE LATEST RUN...BASED ON EXCELLENT DATA FROM
A MULTI AIRCRAFT MISSION TO INITIALIZE THE 00Z ANALYSIS...SHOWS
THE NARROW RIDGE TO THE NORTH BREAKING DOWN AND BONNIE ACCELERATING
NORTH NORTHWESTWARD AND THEN RECURVING NORTHEASTWARD AND STAYING
OFFSHORE OF THE OUTER BANKS BY 100 MILES.  IN CONTRAST THE NOGAPS
AND UKMET MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A SLOW NORTHWEST MOTION TOWARD
GEORGIA OR SOUTH CAROLINA.  MY FORECAST TRACK IS A COMPROMISE WHICH
PUTS THE CENTER ON THE SOUTHERN COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA IN 72 HOURS.
THIS IS A STRATEGY OF LEAST REGRET...SO THAT INTERESTS ALONG THE

REPORTED USING GPS SONDS DURING THE LATEST MISSION WAS 94 KNOTS IN

HURRICANE BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  20
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON AUG 24 1998

LATEST RECON FIX SHOWS LITTLE MOVEMENT...AGAIN.  WE STILL EXPECT A
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION TO RESUME BUT THE STEERING CURRENTS ARE STILL
VERY WEAK IN THE AREA.  LAST NIGHT...THE 00Z GFDL MODEL RUN MADE A
DRASTIC CHANGE...SHIFTING THE FORECAST TRACK TO THE EAST...AND THE
06Z RUN OF THIS MODEL TELLS ABOUT THE SAME STORY.  THE 06Z AVN RUN
OF THE NCEP GLOBAL SPECTRAL MODEL SHOWS THAT THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE HAS ENOUGH OF A BREAK IN THE VICINITY OF EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA TO ALLOW BONNIE TO SLIP THROUGH AND INDEED MANY OF THE
TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS NOW SHOW RECURVATURE AWAY FROM THE COAST. 
HOWEVER THE 00Z NAVY NOGAPS MODEL REFUSES TO RECURVE BONNY...AND
BRINGS THE CYCLONE CLOSE TO THE GEORGIA/FLORIDA BORDER BY THE END OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  INTERESTINGLY...IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT 80 PER
CENT OF THE DROPWINDSONDES FROM YESTERDAYS MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL
SAMPLING MISSION ENTERED INTO THAT MODEL SO IT CANNOT BE
DISREGARDED.  ANOTHER COMPLICATING FACTOR IS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH THAT WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS DROPPING INTO THE NORTH-
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.  THIS FEATURE COULD EXERT SOME INFLUENCE ON
THE FUTURE TRACK OF BONNIE AS WELL.

INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS NEAR 100 KNOTS.  EVEN THOUGH THE EYE HAS
DISAPPEARED...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS REPORTED 109 KNOT WINDS NEAR THE
700 MB LEVEL.  IF BONNIE MOVES A BIT MORE...IT WOULD LIKELY
ENCOUNTER WARMER WATERS AND THIS COULD ALLOW STRENGTHENING.  HOWEVER
THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION OF SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR....PARTICULARLY IN
THE AVN MODEL OUTPUT...SO THIS COULD NEGATE STRENGTHENING.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST HOLDS THE WINDS AT 100 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON AUG 24 1998
 
A SLOW MOTION TOWARD THE NORTHWEST IS EVIDENT...ESTIMATED TO BE
325/05.  OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE IS...SHALL I SAY...DIVERGENT.  AT 72
HOURS THERE IS NEARLY A 1200 N MI SPREAD BETWEEN THE MEDIUM
BAM...NEAR THE GEORGIA COAST...AND THE GFDL WHICH RECURVES BONNIE
OUT TO SEA.  THE 12Z AVN SHOWS A 500 MB SHORTWAVE NEARING THE
NORTHEASTERN U.S. IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...BREAKING DOWN THE RIDGE NEAR
MID-ATLANTIC COAST AND ALLOWING BONNIE TO RECURVE OFFSHORE OF THE
NORTH CAROLINA OUTER BANKS.  HOWEVER THE NOGAPS AND U.K. MET. OFFICE
GLOBAL MODELS COMPLICATE THE FORECAST SINCE THEY DO NOT RECURVE THE
HURRICANE AND TAKE IT NEAR TO..OR ACROSS...THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST.
SINCE THE LATTER TWO MODELS ARE RESPECTABLE ONES...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS STILL NOT COMMITTED TO A RECURVATURE.  WITH SUCH DIVERSE
GUIDANCE...OBVIOUSLY OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE 72 HOUR POINT IS NOT THAT
HIGH.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK COUPLED WITH THE LARGE SIZE OF BONNIE...TROPICAL
STORM FORCE WINDS EXTENDING 200 NM OVER THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT...
DICTATE THE ISSUANCE OF A HURRICANE WATCH FOR A PORTION OF THE U.S.
SOUTHEAST COAST.  STRONG WINDS ARE POSSIBLE ON THE COAST IN 36 HOURS
OR LESS.
 
INTENSITY REMAINS UNCHANGED...NEAR 100 KNOTS.  EVEN THOUGH BONNIE
APPEARS TO BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF MODEST WESTERLY SHEAR...THE
HURRICANE HAS SUCH A LARGE AND POWERFUL CIRCULATION SO AS TO BE
RESILIENT TO THE SHEARING.  ALSO...THE HURRICANE WILL LIKELY MOVE
OVER SLIGHTLY WARMER WATERS DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  LITTLE
CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS PREDICTED UNTIL THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD
WHEN CONDITIONS WILL PROBABLY BECOME A LITTLE MORE HOSTILE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON AUG 24 1998
 
BONNIE LOOKS A LITTLE RAGGED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...BUT LATEST RECON
REPORTED 962 MB WHICH IS ABOUT THE SAME AS 18 HOURS AGO.  117 KNOTS
WAS REPORTED FROM ONE OF THE GPS DROPS NEAR THE 900 MB LEVEL IN THE
NORTHWEST EYEWALL.  THEREFORE...INITIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN AT 100
KNOTS.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS WILL LIKELY OCCUR...BUT WITH BONNIE YET TO
CROSS THE WARM GULF STREAM WE WILL MAINTAIN CAT THREE INTENSITY FOR
MOST OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/07.  THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE REMAINS
DIVERGENT AND THEREFORE THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS DIFFICULT.  THE
NAVY NOGAPS HAS BONNIE CENTERED NEAR THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST WHILE
THE GFDL RECURVES THE HURRICANE AND HAS IT MOVING SOUTH OF NOVA
SCOTIA BY THE END OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.  OUR CURRENT TRACK IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH
THE DEEP LAYER BAM AND THE GFDL THROUGH 36 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...
THERE IS A DECENT CHANCE THAT IT WILL BE CAUGHT UP IN THE WESTERLIES
AND RECURVE.  HOWEVER...IF THE PREDICTED INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED
DOES NOT OCCUR...THERE IS STILL A CHANCE THAT BONNIE COULD MOVE TO
THE LEFT OF OUR OFFICIAL TRACK.

5 AM EDT TUE AUG 25 1998
 
LATEST RECON FIXES SHOW A MOTION OF 330/08 OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS
COMPARED TO 325/05 12 HOURS AGO...SO THE FORWARD MOTION APPEARS TO
BE INCREASING. THE PAST 6 HOUR MOTION IS 10 KNOTS.   USING THE
MULTI-AIRCRAFT MISSION DATA AND THE 00Z AVIATION RUN...THE GFDL
MODEL SHOWS ABOUT THE SAME TRACK AS BEFORE...PASSING ABOUT 75 N.MI.
EAST OF THE OUTER BANKS IN 36 HOURS AND THEN ACCELERATING TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST.  THE UKMET SHOWS A LANDFALL IN SOUTHERN N.C. IN ABOUT 60
HOURS AND THE NOGAPS SHOWS A LANDFALL NEAR CHARLESTON IN 48
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE UKMET AND GFDL AND PUTS THE
CENTER ACROSS THE OUTER BANKS IN 36 TO 48 HOURS.
 
THE 34 KNOT WIND RADII IS ABOUT 165 N.M. IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT
BASED ON A GPS DROPSONDE.  ON THE FORECAST TRACK...GALES WILL REACH
THE N.C. COAST IN ABOUT 24 TO 30 HOURS FROM 09Z...SO IT IS TIME TO
PUT UP A HURRICANE WARNING.
 
IF THE NOGAPS TURNS OUT TO BE CORRECT...THE MOVEMENT SHOULD BE
SLOWER AND THERE WILL BE MORE TIME BEFORE WARNINGS ARE NEEDED
FURTHER SOUTH.
 
THE LAST RECON CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 963 MB AND THE 117 KNOT
FLIGHT LEVEL WIND STILL STANDS AS THE HIGHEST WIND SPEED DURING THE
LAST RECON MISSION.  LATER PASSES FAILED TO FIND A WIND NEAR THAT
VALUE...BUT SINCE THE PRESSURE REMAINS THE SAME...THE WIND SPEED
WILL BE KEPT AT 100 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST WIND SPEED IS THE SAME AS
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT TUE AUG 25 1998
 
MODEST CHANGES TO TRACK THIS MORNING CAN BE INTERPRETED IN TWO WAYS.
WHILE BONNIE HAS ACCELERATED FROM 10 KT TO ABOUT 14 KT...SUGGESTING
THAT IT WILL GET CAUGHT UP IN THE APPROACHING SHORT-WAVE TROUGH OVER
THE GREAT LAKES STATES...THE HEADING HAS STAYED ABOUT THE SAME OR
EVEN EDGED 5 DEGREES TO THE LEFT...ARGUING FOR A DELAY IN ANY TURN.
ALTERNATELY...THESE VARIATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARY. IN ANY
CASE...BONNIE IS QUICKLY APPROACHING THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA AND
ALL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE MADE NOW FOR A POWERFUL HURRICANE THERE.
 
THE TRACK GUIDANCE HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS WITH
MOST FORECASTS SUPPORTING THE CURRENT NHC TRACK WHICH IS A LITTLE
FASTER AND A BIT TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THIS
FORECAST IMPLIES THAT TROPICAL STORM WINDS WILL ARRIVE ON THE NORTH
CAROLINA AND THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST NEAR MIDNIGHT AND HURRICANE
FORCE WINDS NEAR DAWN TOMORROW.
 
WESTERLY SHEAR AND AN INFLUX OF SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR INTO THE
SOUTHWEST SECTOR HAS LED TO A MORE RAGGED APPEARANCE TO BONNIE ON
SATELLITE PICTURES.  WHILE THERE IS NO EYE APPARENT ON
SATELLITE...OR TO THE HURRICANE HUNTERS...THE RECON RECENTLY
REPORTED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 964 MB.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT...DESPITE
THE APPEARANCE...BONNIE HAS PROBABLY NOT CHANGED MUCH IN INTENSITY.
INDEED...AN EXPERIMENTAL RUN OF THE GFDL...COUPLED WITH AN OCEAN
MODEL...INDICATES THAT SOME STRENGTHENING REMAINS POSSIBLE DURING
THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

WHILE THE OVERALL MOTION REMAINS TOWARD ABOUT 325/330 DEGREES AT 14
KT...SATELLITE PICTURES CLEARLY SHOW SOME POTENTIALLY DECEPTIVE
NORTHWESTWARD WOBBLING OF THE EYE ALONG THAT TRACK.  SOME EVIDENCE
OF AN EYEWALL IS NOW SEEN IN THE IMAGERY AND THE HURRICANE HUNTERS
REPORTED AN OPEN...ELLIPTICAL SHAPE EYE BEFORE THEY DEPARTED A FEW
HOURS AGO.  THEY MEASURED FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS A LITTLE IN EXCESS OF
100 KT TWICE TODAY IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE CENTRAL PRESSURE
AT 1738Z...THE LAST FIX BEFORE ABOUT 00Z...WAS ONCE AGAIN 963 MB. 
BASED ON RECENT SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS...THE NEXT MEASURED PRESSURE
COULD BE LOWER.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 100 KT.
 
THE 12Z GUIDANCE SHOWS MUCH MORE CONSISTENCY THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
ALL DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE NOW SHOWS THE CENTER MAKING LANDFALL IN
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA OR PASSING JUST OFFSHORE. THIS IS GENERALLY
FOLLOWED BY A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST WITH ACCELERATION.  WHILE
THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE FORWARD SPEED...THE
CONSENSUS IS QUITE SIMILAR TO OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH IS CLOSELY
FOLLOWED FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS.  OUR TRACK FROM 36 TO 72 HOURS IS
OFFSET ABOUT 45 NMI TO THE RIGHT OF 6 HOURS AGO.  ALL DYNAMICAL
GUIDANCE EXCEPT NOGAPS IS EVEN FARTHER OFFSHORE...TO THE RIGHT.
THESE MODEST CHANGES ARE BASED ON THE EXPECTATION THAT THE
APPROACHING SHORT-WAVE TROUGHS WILL TURN BONNIE TO THE NORTH LATER
TONIGHT AND THEN ACCELERATE IT NORTHEASTWARD BY THURSDAY.

THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING FROM CAPE ROMAIN TO MURRELLS INLET IS
CHANGED TO A HURRICANE WARNING ON THIS ADVISORY.

HURRICANE BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  28
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT TUE AUG 25 1998
 
FORWARD SPEED APPEARS TO HAVE SLOWED JUST A BIT...TO NEAR 12 KNOTS.
OTHERWISE THE TRACK IS ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE...AND ALL OF OUR
GUIDANCE...ASIDE FROM SHALLOW LAYER STEERING WHICH IS NOT VALID FOR
A HURRICANE...SHOW A TURN TO THE NORTH BY MORNING.  SO...VERY LITTLE
CHANGE IS MADE FROM THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST.  IN FACT...THE
SLIGHT SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED MAY BE PRESAGING A CHANGE IN
DIRECTION.  A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS APPROACHING
THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND THIS FEATURE SHOULD BRING ABOUT THE
EXPECTED TURN TO THE RIGHT.  IN 24 TO 36 HOURS BONNIE IS EXPECTED TO
BE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD WITH AN ACCELERATING FORWARD SPEED.
 
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE NORTHWARD TURN HAS NOT TAKEN
PLACE YET.  HOWEVER...WE EMPHASIZE THAT ONE SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON THE
PRECISE TRACK...ESPECIALLY SINCE BONNIE HAS SUCH A LARGE ENVELOPE OF
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS.  EVEN IF THE CURRENT NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION
CONTINUES LONGER THAN FORECAST...BONNIE WOULD STILL MAKE LANDFALL
WITHIN THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA.
 
INTENSITY IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED.  HURRICANE HUNTERS COULD NOT
FIND AN EYE...YET THEY FOUND WINDS TO 114 KNOTS AT THE 700 MB FLIGHT
LEVEL OVER THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT A FEW HOURS AGO.  CLOUD TOPS ON
SATELLITE IMAGERY ARE NOT VERY COLD AND DVORAK ESTIMATES OF
INTENSITY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE PROVIDED BY THE
AIRCRAFT.  THIS UNDERSCORES THE GREAT VALUE OF AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE
IN HURRICANES THAT ARE THREATENING POPULATED COASTAL AREAS.
 
EVEN THOUGH SOME FLUCTUATIONS ARE POSSIBLE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
IN INTENSITY IS FORECAST UNTIL BONNIE PASSES THE OUTER BANKS.
WEAKENING IS FORECAST LATER ON AS IT ENCOUNTERS WESTERLY SHEAR AND
COOLER WATERS.

LATEST RECON FIX GIVES A MOTION OF 320/12 OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS BUT
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS MOTION SUGGESTS MORE OF A NORTHWARD DIRECTION.
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/12.  ALL GUIDANCE SHOWS AN
IMMEDIATE TURN TOWARD THE NORTH EXCEPT THE UKMET WHICH CONTINUES A

FORECAST DISREGARDS THE UKMET AND MAKES A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST

PERHAPS THE EXTENSION OF THE WARNING TO EDISTO BEACH WILL TURN OUT
TO HAVE BEEN UNNECESSARY...BUT THERE IS NO POINT IN AGONIZING ABOUT
IT.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWS RAPID ACCELERATION AFTER 24 HOURS
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK SHOWS THE CENTER CROSSING THE COAST JUST SOUTH OF

RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT...AND SATELLITE NOW HINT AT THE EXPECTED
TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE INITIAL MOTION...AVERAGED OVER THE PAST
6 HOURS...IS 340 DEGREES WHILE A VERY SHORT-TERM MOTION IS DUE
NORTH.  WE WILL USE 350/10 KT.  THE REDUCED SPEED IS ALSO CONSISTENT
WITH THE FIRST STAGES OF A TURN IN THE TRACK.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
AGAIN ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 100 KT.
 
THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH FEATURES TO THE NNW OF BONNIE APPEAR MORE
PROMINENTLY ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THAN 24 HOUR AGO.  THE SOUTHERN
EXTENT OF THE APPROACHING TROUGH IS FARTHER SOUTH THAN YESTERDAY AS
WELL...AND THIS LENDS ADDITIONAL CONFIDENCE TO THE EXPECTATION THAT
THE HURRICANE WILL SOON BE CAUGHT UP IN THE MIDDLE LATITUDE FLOW AND
EVENTUALLY ACCELERATE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.  THE 06Z AVN AND GFDL
RUNS SHOW THAT EVOLUTION...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL TRACK.
 
IN THE SHORT-TERM...THE GREATER NORTHWARD COMPONENT SUGGESTS A TRACK
A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF 6 HOURS AGO.  THE RATHER SLOW MOTION LIKELY
MEANS A PROLONGED...12-18 HOUR...BATTERING BY STRONG WINDS FOR SOME
PORTIONS OF EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA.  IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE STORM
SURGE WILL PERSIST LONG ENOUGH TO BE INFLUENCED BY AT LEAST TWO
DIFFERENT HIGH TIDES BEFORE BONNIE LEAVES THE AREA.
 
WITH THE CENTER NOW OFFSHORE FROM THE NORTHERN PART OF SOUTH
CAROLINA AND WITH A NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OBSERVED...THE WARNINGS AND
WATCHES SOUTH OF CAPE ROMAIN SOUTH CAROLINA ARE DISCONTINUED.

HURRICANE BONNIE DISCUSSION NUMBER  32
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT WED AUG 26 1998
 
A NEW AND POTENTIALLY SERIOUS FORECAST PROBLEM HAS ARISEN.
AT THE MOMENT...BONNIE IS MOVING NORTHWARD AT 5 TO 10 KT...AND ITS
CENTER IS COMING ASHORE.  HOWEVER...SEVERAL OF TODAY/S COMPUTER
SIMULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE NEARBY SHORT-WAVE COULD BYPASS THE
HURRICANE...LEAVING IT TO MOVE VERY SLOWLY FOR A DAY OR TWO.  IF
THIS OCCURS...IT COULD CREATE AN ENORMOUS FLOOD PROBLEM.
 
SUPPORTING THIS CONSIDERATION IS WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WHICH SHOWS THE
NEARBY SHORT-WAVE TROUGH AXIS NOW APPROACHING THE LONGITUDE OF
BONNIE.  THE NE-SW STRETCHING OF THE UPPER LEVEL CLOUD PATTERN ALSO
SUGGESTS THAT THE TROUGH MIGHT BE EXERTING ITS MAXIMUM INFLUENCE ON
THE MOTION OF BONNIE AT THIS TIME.

FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE...THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS SLOWED CONSIDERABLY
THROUGH 36 HOURS...AND NOW KEEPS THE CENTER OVER EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA THROUGH THAT PERIOD.  THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO THE GFDL
FORECAST.
 
A NOAA RESEARCH AIRCRAFT REPORTED 116 KT AT THE 8000 FT FLIGHT
LEVEL.  A DROPWINDSONDE RELEASED EARLY THIS AFTERNOON BY THE AIR
FORCE MEASURED 110 KT IN THE EASTERN EYEWALL NOT FAR ABOVE THE
SURFACE.  ESTIMATED MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS ARE 100 KT.  WEAKENING
WILL OCCUR AFTER LANDFALL.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS FROM VIRGINIA NORTHWARD HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO
ACCOMMODATE THE CHANGE IN FORECAST TRACK.
 
THE HURRICANE HUNTERS RECENTLY EXTRAPOLATED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF
959 MB.  DROPSONDE PRESSURES...NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS FIX...HAVE
BEEN CONSISTENTLY 3 OR 4 MB HIGHER.

RADAR...SURFACE DATA...AND RECON INDICATE LITTLE MOVEMENT...PERHAPS
A SLIGHT NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD DRIFT...OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. 
THE CENTER HAS BEEN HUGGING THE COASTLINE BUT IT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE
SLOWLY ACROSS EXTREME EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA DURING THE NEXT 24
HOURS IN AGREEMENT WITH MOST OF OUR OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTIONS. 
THE NHC FORECAST ALSO SHOWS A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST AND EAST-
NORTHEAST LATER IN THE PERIOD...WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE GFDL TRACK.

THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF BONNIE WILL LIKELY PRODUCE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF
RAINFALL.  TOTALS UP TO 20 INCHES OR SO ARE SHOWN BY THE LATEST GFDL
RUN.  THIS WOULD CREATE A SERIOUS FLOOD PROBLEM.  

THE CIRCULATION IS GRADUALLY WEAKENING AS IT INTERACTS WITH LAND. 
MAXIMUM DOPPLER RADAR VELOCITIES FROM THE WSR-88D ARE BARELY 90
KNOTS AT 4000 TO 5000 FT TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  CURRENT
INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 85 KNOTS AND GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD

...CORRECTION FOR FORCAST POSITIONS AND INLAND DESIGNATIONS...
 
RADAR AND AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE FIXES OVER THE LAST

A SLOW PACE.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 020/04 KNOTS.
LATEST RECON WINDS ARE SHOWING A MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND OF

HURRICANE FORCE WINDS WITH ONLY TROPICAL STORM REPORTS.  THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 75 KNOTS.  FURTHER SLOW
WEAKENING IS FORECAST AS THE SYSTEM TRAVERSES LAND OVER THE

NWS DOPPLER RADAR DISPLAYS SUGGEST THAT MAXIMUM SUSTAINED SURFACE
WINDS IN BONNIE HAVE DROPPED BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH.  THE CENTER
PASSED NEAR NEW BERN AND CHERRY PT MCAS AROUND 13Z...WITH PRESSURES
DROPPING TO ABOUT 983 MB.  THESE DATA SUPPORT DOWNGRADING BONNIE TO
A TROPICAL STORM...WITH 55 KT WINDS AND SOME GUSTS STILL TO
HURRICANE FORCE...MAINLY OVER THE WATERS TO THE EAST.
 
THE MOTION ESTIMATE IS 035 DEGREES AT 5 KT AND THE FORECAST TRACK IS
LITTLE CHANGED.  THIS KEEPS THE POTENTIAL HIGH FOR FLOODING RAINS
OVER EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA THROUGH TONIGHT.  SOME INCREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED IS PREDICTED...IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT GFDL OUTPUT.
THE SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO REMAIN AT TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH AFTER
EXITING THE COAST AND COULD PASS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE NORTHEASTERN
STATES TO CAUSE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS ALONG/NEAR THE COAST.

DOPPLER RADAR DATA AND OBSERVATIONS FROM OCRACOKE ISLAND AND DIAMOND

BIT AT THE SURFACE AS THE CIRCULATION BEGINS TO MOVE BACK OVER
WATER.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE NOW ESTIMATED AT 60 KT WITH GUSTS TO

DOPPLER RADAR DATA ALSO SHOWS AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED TO ABOUT
8 KT ALONG A HEADING OF 45 DEGREES.  MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE
SHOWS AN ACCELERATION OFFSHORE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND THEN THE

PICKED UP BY THE WESTERLIES.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS TRACK.
 
THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED TO 50 KNOTS BASED ON DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES AND SURFACE WIND OBSERVATIONS.  A BAND OF DEEP CONVECTION
IS LOCATED TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER...AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS
VERY LITTLE CLOUDINESS REMAINING ON THE WEST HALF OF THE STORM...THE
SYSTEM STILL HAS MORE TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS THAN EXTRATROPICAL. 
THE FORECAST WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS THROUGH 24 HOURS WHEN
THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO BE EXTRATROPICAL.

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT HAS CLOSED OFF A WEAK
LOW LEVEL CENTER IN THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND WE ARE UPGRADING
THE DISTURBED AREA TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/11.  THIS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AS
WE HAVE NOT BEEN TRACKING A WELL-DEFINED CENTE FOR VERY LONG.  THE
GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR THE NEXT 72
HOURS AND THE CENTER SHOULD REACH THE TEXAS COAST IN ABOUT 18 HOURS.
 
ALTHOUGH THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS ONLY ABOUT 20 KNOTS...
SATELLITE IMAGERY IS FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE AND THERE IS NO KNOWN REASON
TO PREVENT INTENSIFICATION.  TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE ISSUED FOR
MOST OF THE TEXAS COAST ON THIS BASIS.

MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL (5 KFT) WIND OF 57 KNOTS IN THE NORTHEAST
QUADRANT.  WIND ESTIMATES FROM THE NWS CORPUS CHRISTI (KCRP)
WSR-88D HAVE BEEN RUNNING BETWEEN 60 AND 65 KNOTS AT 3500 TO
4500 FT.  THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED BY RECONNAISSANCE
IS 1003 MB.  THE ROCKPORT ASOS SITE AT 08Z REPORTED 36 KNOTS
SUSTAINED WINDS WITH A GUST TO 42 KNOTS.  BASED ON THIS DATA...
THE INITIAL INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY WILL BE ADJUSTED UP TO 50
KNOTS.  LITTLE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS EXPECTED BEFORE
LANDFALL.
 
AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE NWS OFFICES ALONG THE COASTS OF LOUISIANA
AND TEXAS...THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING WILL REDUCED ON THE EAST
SIDE...AND NOW EXTENDS FROM SABINE PASS TO BROWNSVILLE TEXAS.  THE
SMALL CRAFT REMAIN IN PORT STATEMENT WILL EXTEND FROM THE MOUTH OF
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER TO SABINE PASS.  FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS WILL
LIKELY ME MADE LATER THIS MORNING.
 
THE PRIMARY THREAT POSED BY CHARLEY WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.
RADAR 3-HOURLY PRECIPITATION ESTIMATES FROM KCRP ARE AVERAGING
AROUND 3.5 INCHES BETWEEN CORPUS CHRISTI AND VICTORIA TEXAS.
RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 4 TO 8 INCHES ARE POSSIBLE AS CHARLEY MOVES
INLAND.
 
THE LATEST RADAR POSITIONS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LAST
AIRCRAFT CENTER FIX.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/09 KNOTS.
THIS MOTION SHOULD BRING THE CENTER OF CHARLEY ON THE COAST IN
THE VICINITY OF PORT ARANSAS TEXAS WITHIN THE NEXT 4 TO 5 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE TURNS THE SYSTEM
TO A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD HEADING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO...AND IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH LBAR.
THIS TRACK REPRESENTS A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO THE RIGHT FROM THE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST TUE AUG 25 1998

DANIELLE HAS A SYMMETRIC APPEARANCE IN SATELLITE IMAGERY WITH 
GOOD OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THERE HAS BEEN A 
RATHER PERSISTENT AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER OF
DANIELLE OVER THE LAST 4-6 HOURS.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 3.5 AND 2.5...RESPECTIVELY.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 45 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  

MODEST SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR SEEN IN SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND 
IN ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL
SATELLITE STUDIES...IS ASSOCIATE WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW SEEN IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY BETWEEN DANIELLE AND THE LESSER ANTILLES. THIS
LOW IS FORECAST TO MOVE WESTWARD DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST ALTHOUGH DANIELLE MAY
EXPERIENCE SOME VERTICAL SHEAR DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS. BY
48 HOURS DANIELLE IS BROUGHT TO HURRICANE STRENGTH AS THE SHEAR
IS FORECAST TO DIMINISH.   
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/18 KNOTS.  THE 00Z AVIATION
MODEL CONTINUES TO SUGGEST THAT A RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC NORTH OF THE LESSER ANTILLES.  THIS WOULD RESULT
IN A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
POSSIBLE A MORE WESTWARD HEADING BEYOND 72 HOURS.  THE GFDL SHOWS
THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO AND IS THE LEFT-MOST OF THE 06Z TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A LITTLE RIGHT OF THE

FORECAST MODEL WHICH BRINGS THE HURRICANE TO 100 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/18. MODELS IN GENERAL SUGGEST THAT THE
HURRICANE SHOULD TURN A LITTLE MORE TO THE WEST AS THE RIDGE BUILDS
TO THE NORTH. THIS IS EMPHASIZED BY GFDL WHICH TURNS THE DANIELLE
WESTWARD IN ABOUT 24 HOURS OR SO.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN
BETWEEN THE GFDL AND LBAR. 

A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE NECESSARY FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN
LEEWARD ISLANDS AS EARLY AS TONIGHT OR WEDNESDAY.

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER   6
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 PM EST TUE AUG 25 1998
 
DANIELLE IS A SMALL HURRICANE IN TERMS OF ITS AREA OF DEEP
CONVECTION BUT IT HAS A LARGE ENVELOPE. T-NUMBERS CONTINUE TO
INCREASE AND TAFB ESTIMATED THAT WINDS ARE ABOUT 75 KNOTS. DANIELLE
HAS A WELL ESTABLISHED OUTFLOW AND THE ANTICYCLONE ALOFT IS FORECAST
TO MOVE WITH THE SYSTEM.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE HURRICANE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THIS IS ALSO
INDICATED BY SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL WHICH BRINGS DANIELLE TO
ABOUT 107 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 290/18.  A STRONG 500 MB RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
DEVELOP OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  THIS PATTERN WILL PROBABLY
KEEP DANIELLE ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK OR EVEN A LITTLE
MORE TO THE WEST THAN THE PRESENT COURSE AND THIS IS REFLECTED BY
MOST OF THE MODELS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
ENSEMBLE BUT CLOSER TO THE GDFL SOLUTION.  ON THIS TRACK THE CENTER
OF DANIELLE WILL PASS TO THE NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS...AS
SUGGESTED BY THE LATEST 12Z GDFL RUN.  HOWEVER...ANY DEVIATION TO
THE LEFT OF THE TRACK WOULD BRING DANIELLE CLOSER THE LEEWARD
ISLANDS.  THEREFORE...A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THIS
AREA TONIGHT OR WEDNESDAY.

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER   8
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST WED AUG 26 1998
 
AN EYE IS NO LONGER APPARENT IN SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE CENTER OF
DANIELLE IS EMBEDDED WITHIN -70 DEG C CLOUD TOPS.  DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB ARE NOW 90 KNOTS...AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS INCREASED TO 90 KNOTS.  THE OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED OVER
THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE DUE TO SOUTHEASTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR.  
THIS IS CONFIRMED BY ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES...CIMSS.  THE UPPER LOW SEEN IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY JUST NORTHWEST OF PUERTO RICO IS EXPECTED 
TO SHIFT WEST AS THE ANTICYCLONE OVER DANIELLE BUILDS IN.  THE
INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR CONTINUED STRENGTHENING. THIS IS 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY
PREDICTION SCHEME..SHIPS. 
 
DANIELLE HAS CONTINUED ON A WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE THIS MORNING...
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/19 KNOTS.  A STRONG 500 MB
RIDGE IS FORECAST TO BUILD OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC DURING
THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS.  THIS SHOULD KEEP DANIELLE ON A GENERAL WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND ALL OF THE 06Z
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS CLUSTERED ON THIS HEADING.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK MAINTAINS A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 
THE PERIOD WITH A SLIGHT DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED BETWEEN 48 AND
72 HOURS.  THIS IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL SOLUTION.  

BASED ON THIS TRACK A HURRICANE WATCH IS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE
NORTHERN PORTION OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...
ANY SOUTHWARD DEVIATION IN THE TRACK WOULD BRING DANIELLE CLOSER 
TO THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.  THEREFORE...ALL INTERESTS IN THE LEEWARD  
ISLANDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
HURRICANE.

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER   9
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT WED AUG 26 1998
 
THE COMBINATION OF AN UPPER-LOW AHEAD OF DANIELLE AND THE FAST
FORWARD MOTION OF THE HURRICANE IS CAUSING SOME SHEARING. THE
EARLIER RAPID DEVELOPMENT TREND IS NOT LONGER OCCURRING AT THIS
TIME. THE EYE IS NOT LONGER VISIBLE BUT IS PROBABLY EMBEDDED WITH AN
AREA OF ASYMMETRIC DEEP CONVECTION. INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 90
KNOTS AND IT HAS BEEN HELD FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND THEN
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  THE REASONINGS ARE THAT GLOBAL MODELS
ARE MOVING THE UPPER-LOW TOWARD THE WEST-SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF
DANIELLE...CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT OF LOW SHEAR. IN ADDITION...SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL BRINGS DANIELLE TO ABOUT 105 KNOTS BY 72
HOURS.
 
DANIELLE CONTINUES MOVING AT 290/18. MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS ARE
DEVELOPING A STRONG MID-LEVEL RIDE OVER THE CENTRAL NORTH ATLANTIC.
THIS PATTERN WOULD FAVOR A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS.
TRACK MODELS ARE ALSO IN AGREEMENT WITH A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK
ALTHOUGH GFDL...BAMD AND NOGAPS MOVE THE HURRICANE ON A MORE
WESTWARD TRACK.  WE HAVE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE UPPER LOW AHEAD OF
DANIELLE BECAUSE IF THE HURRICANE GETS INVOLVED WITHIN THE FLOW
AROUND THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE UPPER-LOW...A MORE WESTWARD COULD
OCCUR. THIS APPEARS NOT TO BE THE CASE AT THIS TIME.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT WED AUG 26 1998

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT STRONG SOUTHERLY SHEAR IS BEGINNING
TO DISRUPT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH DANIELLE.  DVORAK 
INTENSITY ESTIMATES SUGGESTS THAT THE HURRICANE HAS WEAKENED TO 75
KNOTS OR LESS. A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE AREA
TONIGHT AND WILL GIVE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE INTENSITY.

DANIELLE IS A SMALL SYSTEM WHICH IN GENERAL IS VERY SENSITIVE TO
SHEAR.  THE UPPER TROUGH/LOW AHEAD OF DANIELLE IS RETROGRADING AS
FORECAST BY MODELS BUT IT IS STILL CLOSE ENOUGH TO RESTRICT THE
WESTERN OUTFLOW. WE ARE FORECASTING SOME WEAKENING DURING THE NEXT
12 TO 24 HOURS BUT ASSUMING THAT THE SHEAR WILL RELAX...A GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED THEREAFTER.  IN FACT...SHIPS INTENSITY
FORECAST MODEL INSISTS ON INTENSIFYING DANIELLE.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 290/18. A STRONG MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH IS FORECAST
TO BUILD OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC. IN RESPONSE TO THAT
FEATURE...THE GFDL..BAM-DEEP... NOGAPS AND LBAR MODELS MAINTAIN THE
SAME WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
GOES ALONG WITH THESE MODELS...INDICATING SOME DECREASE IN FORWARD

AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT HAS FOUND A 70-KNOT DANIELLE WHICH
IS VERY ASYMMETRIC IN ITS WIND FIELD WITH MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS
OF 37 KNOTS OVER THE SOUTHWEST QUAD...77 KNOTS OVER THE NORTHEAST
QUAD AND 73 KNOTS OVER THE NORTHEAST QUAD.  THE LARGE ASYMMETRY IS
UNDOUBTABLY DUE TO THE LARGE...18 KNOTS...TRANSLATION SPEED AND THE
LARGE PRESSURE GRADIENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH. 
THEREFORE THE WIND RADII WILL CHANGE SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THIS
PACKAGE.  THE LOWEST ESTIMATED SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 992MB LOCATED
NEAR THE WIND MINIMUM.

SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW STRONG SOUTHERLY SHEAR DISRUPTING
THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH DANIELLE.  DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES REMAIN AT 4.5 OR ABOUT 75 KNOTS.
 
WE NOW ESTIMATE THE SURFACE WINDS TO BE 70 KNOTS AT THE SURFACE AND
HOLD THAT INTENSITY THROUGH 24 HOURS...INCREASING THE FORECAST
INTENSITY TO 95 KNOTS AT 72 HOURS.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE
REDUCTION IN FORECAST VERTICAL SHEAR FOR THE LATTER PERIODS.  THIS
IS IN KEEPING WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST.   
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 285/18.  A STRONG MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH CONTINUES
TO BE FORECAST TO BUILD OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  IN
RESPONSE TO THAT FEATURE...THE GFDL..BAM-DEEP...NOGAPS AND LBAR
MODELS MAINTAIN THE SAME WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 48 HOURS AND
THEN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES ALONG WITH

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT THU AUG 27 1998

THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH CHANGE TO THE INITIAL MOTION OR TO THE TRACK
FORECAST.  THERE IS A WEAKNESS IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN ATLANTIC NEAR THE U.S. EAST COAST
PARTIALLY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF BONNIE.  AS BONNIE SLOWLY EXITS THE
SCENE...SOME RIDGING WILL PROBABLY BUILD BACK IN OVER THAT AREA. 
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...THE 18Z NCEP AVN MODEL RUN
SHOWS A RATHER LARGE 500 MB TROUGH CARVING OUT OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
WHICH SHOULD CREATE A MORE NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF STEERING.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS REASONING AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WITH THE GFDL AND BAM GUIDANCE AS WELL.

AIR FORCE RECON FOUND A 992 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE AND A TIGHT WIND
CENTER THAT IS IN THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE MAIN CONVECTIVE CLOUD
MASS.  DANIELLE IS A SMALL HURRICANE IN SIZE.  SHIP REPORTS INDICATE
THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII ARE NO MORE THAN 100 N MI.  
CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 80 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  DANIELLE
HAS A FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN AND THE
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS VERTICAL SHEAR MAPS SHOW REASONABLY
WEAK VERTICAL SHEAR IN THE NEAR ENVIRONMENT.  THE LATEST SHIPS MODEL
OUTPUT ALSO SHOWS LIGHT SHEAR.  STRENGTHENING IS PREDICTED...SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORIES AND TO THE SHIPS GUIDANCE.  DANIELLE
COULD BECOME A CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

GUIDANCE...AND IS THE SAME AS IN PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/15.  THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF
A RIDGE WILL BUILD IN AFTER HURRICANE BONNIE MOVES OUT.  MOST OF THE
TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN INDICATING THAT A
GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH SHOULD OCCUR AFTER 36 HOURS OR SO.
HOWEVER...MANY OF THESE GUIDANCE MODELS USE THE AVIATION MODEL FOR
THE BACKGROUND FIELD AND THE AVIATION MODEL SEEMS CONTAMINATED BY A
BOGUS VORTEX NEAR THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF
THIS NORTHWARD MOTION.  OUR CURRENT FORECAST TRACK STILL SEEMS
REASONABLE GIVEN THAT THE UKMET MODEL IS TO THE RIGHT OF OUR TRACK
AND THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL IS TO THE LEFT OF OUR TRACK.

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER  17
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT FRI AUG 28 1998

DANIELLE IS A SMALL AND TIGHT HURRICANE.  LATEST RECON  FOUND A 20 N
MI DIAMETER EYE WITH EXCELLENT PRESENTATION ON RADAR. AND MEASURED
79 KNOT-WINDS FROM THE SOUTHWEST ABOUT 9 N MI FROM THE EYE.  MINIMUM
PRESSURE WAS 988 MB. THE UPPER-LOW OVER THE EASTERN BAHAMAS IS
MOVING WESTWARD AHEAD OF DANIELLE AND WILL LIKELY PROVIDE A
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT ALOFT FOR SOME STRENGTHENING. THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST AND THE GFDL COUPLED
MODELS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS DANIELLE TO 100 KNOTS BY 48
HOURS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14.  THE RIDGE NORTH OF DANIELLE IS EXPECTED
TO WEAKEN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WHILE A STRONG MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. IN
RESPONSE TO THAT PATTERN...TRACK MODELS...WHICH ARE IN REMARKABLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT... CONSISTENTLY TURN DANIELLE NORTHWESTWARD AND
NORTHWARD BEYOND 48 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE MODEL
ENSEMBLE TURNING DANIELLE NORTHWARD BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. IN THIS CASE THE HURRICANE WILL STAY AWAY FROM THE U.S.
SOUTHEAST COAST.  THE NOAA HIGH ALTITUDE JET WILL SAMPLE THE
ENVIRONMENT NORTH OF DANIELLE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND
WILL PROVIDE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE.

AN AIR FORCE PLANE HAS BEEN OBSERVING DANIELLE DURING THE MORNING
AND MEASURED FLIGHT-LEVEL PEAK WINDS OF 88 KNOTS ABOUT 12 NM FROM
THE EYE. THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED SO FAR IS 986 MB AND
SATELLITE ESTIMATES ARE BETWEEN 77 AND 90 KNOTS. INITIAL INTENSITY
IS SET AT 80 KNOTS. THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER THIRTY-
DEGREE CELSIUS WATERS AND THE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO RELAX. THE
HURRICANE HAS NO WESTERLIES AHEAD AT ALL AND IN FACT...ONE CAN
OBSERVE THE HIGH CLOUDS STREAMING WESTWARD FROM THE HURRICANE. WE DO
NOT SEE THAT VERY OFTEN IN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WHERE WESTERLIES ARE
MORE THAN OFTEN DISRUPTING THE TROPICAL CYCLONES.  THE ENVIRONMENT
LOOKS FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH SHIPS

11 PM EDT FRI AUG 28 1998
 
AIR FORCE RECONN OBSERVED DANIELLE DURING THE DAY AND MEASURED
FLIGHT-LEVEL PEAK WINDS OF 88 KNOTS ABOUT 12 NM FROM THE EYE.  THIS
EVENING THE HIGHEST RECONN WIND SPEED AT FLIGHT LEVEL WAS 67 KNOTS
OVER THE NORTHWEST QUAD WITH A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 989 MB. 
DVORAK SATELLITE ESTIMATES REMAIN BETWEEN 77 AND 90 KNOTS.

THEREFORE DANIELLE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN AT 80 KNOTS.  THE
HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER THIRTY DEGREE CELSIUS WATERS AND
THE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO RELAX.  THE ENVIRONMENT LOOKS FAVORABLE FOR
STRENGTHENING AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST AND THE GFDL COUPLED MODELS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST BRINGS DANIELLE TO 100 KNOTS BY 48 HOURS.
 
DANIELLE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/11...A LITTLE SLOWER AND MORE
NORTHERLY THAN PREVIOUSLY.  THE RIDGE NORTH OF DANIELLE IS EXPECTED
TO WEAKEN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WHILE A STRONG MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. IN
RESPONSE TO THAT PATTERN...ALL TRACK MODELS REMAIN IN GOOD AGREEMENT

NORTHEASTWARD AHEAD OF THE TROUGH BEYOND 48 HOURS.  THE EXCELLENT
MODEL AGREEMENT IN TRACK INCREASES THE LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH KEEPS THE HURRICANE AWAY FROM THE EAST COAST
OF THE UNITED STATES.

HPC RAISED A POINT DURING THE CONFERENCE CALL ON THE 18Z AVIATION
RUN OF THE MRF MODEL.  THIS RUN AND THE GUIDANCE DEPENDENT ON IT
TEND TO SLOW THE HURRICANE DURING THE LAST PERIOD.  THE INTERESTING
THING ABOUT THIS 18Z RUN IS THE SPURIOUS VORTEX BEING GENERATED EAST
OF DANIELLE WHICH APPEARS TO BE DISRUPTING THE RIDGE AND THEREFORE
SLOWING THE NORTHWARD PROGRESS OF DANIELLE.  THE OOZ RUN OF THE MRF
MODEL WILL CONTAIN THE JET DROPWINSONDE AND MAY HELP TO RESOLVE THIS
QUESTION.  NO OTHER GLOBAL MODEL SUGGEST THIS SLOWING OF DANIELLE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SAT AUG 29 1998
 
THE AIR FORCE RECONN MISSION WHICH COVERED THE 00Z AND 06Z FIXES
REPORTED FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS IN THE MID SEVENTIES OVER THE NORTHERN
QUADRANTS.  CENTRAL PRESSURES RANGED FROM 989 TO 991 MB.  DVORAK
SATELLITE ESTIMATES REMAIN BETWEEN 77 AND 90 KNOTS.
 
THEREFORE DANIELLE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN AT 80 KNOTS.  THE
VERTICAL SHEAR CONTINUES TO BE FORECAST TO RELAX AND EVEN NOW THE
ENVIRONMENT SEEMS FAVORABLE FOR SOME STRENGTHENING BUT IT HAS YET TO
MATERIALIZE.  IN KEEPING WITH THE SHIPS FORECAST INTENSITY MODEL...
THE FORECAST INTENSITY WILL BE KEPT AT 80 KNOTS THROUGH 12 HOURS AND
THEN INCREASE AT A MODEST RATE.
 
DANIELLE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/12...A LITTLE MORE NORTHERLY THAN
PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF A MORE SOUTHERLY INITIAL POSITION.  THE RIDGE
NORTH OF DANIELLE IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN IN 48 HOURS OVER THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC WHILE A STRONG MID-LATITUDE TROUGH IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER
THE EASTERN UNITED STATES IN THAT SAME TIME FRAME.  IN RESPONSE TO
THAT PATTERN...ALL TRACK MODELS REMAIN IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND
CONSISTENTLY TURN DANIELLE NORTHWARD AND NORTHEASTWARD AHEAD OF THE
TROUGH BEYOND 48 HOURS.
 
THE QUESTION OF DANIELLE SLOWING DOWN AFTER THE 36 HOUR FORECAST
PERIOD REMAINS WITH THE 00Z AVIATION RUN.  NOGAPS AND THE UKMET
MODELS FOR 00Z DO NOT SLOW DANIELLE AND INDEED ACCELERATE IT TO THE
NORTHEAST AFTER THE TURN AT 48 HOURS.  SINCE THE AVIATION RUN
APPEARS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE APPROACHING SHORT WAVE TROUGH,
IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE SPURIOUS VORTEX TO THE EAST MUST BE
DISRUPTING THE RIDGE.
 
ANALYSIS OF THE JET DROPS SHOW A GOOD RIDGE THROUGH 400 MB NORTH OF
DANIELLE.  THE DROPS DO NOT EXTEND FAR ENOUGH EAST TO PREVENT THE
SPURIOUS VORTEX FROM GENERATING.

SATELLITE AND RECON INDICATE THAT DANIELLE HAS NOT CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE YESTERDAY.  THE PLANE REPORTED A CLOSED EYE WALL
OF 10 NMI DIAMETER AND A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 988 MB.  THERE
HAS BEEN NO REPORTS OF WINDS HIGHER THAN 60 TO 70 KNOTS AT THIS
TIME.  THE HURRICANE LOOKS IMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE IMAGES WITH A
CIRCULAR CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST AND TWO OUTFLOW CHANNELS. WE ARE
KEEPING THE INITIAL INTENSITY AT 80 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  IN SPITE OF
SUCH A GOOD ENVIRONMENT...DANIELLE HAS FAILED TO INTENSIFY AS
FORECAST.  HOWEVER...THE LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT INTENSITY CHANGES
SUGGESTS THAT THE HURRICANE SHOULD STRENGTHEN.  SHIPS INTENSITY
FORECAST MODEL INSISTS ON BRINGING DANIELLE TO 100 KNOTS AND SO DOES
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION IS 295/12.  THE KEY PLAYER IS THE MID-LATITUDE TROUGH
WHICH IS FORECAST TO BE MOVING OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES AND
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THIS TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY DANIELLE NORTHWARD IN ABOUT 24
TO 36 HOURS AND THEN NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC. TRACK
MODELS CAPTURED THIS FEATURE AND ALL OF THEM...CONSISTENTLY TURN
DANIELLE NORTHEASTWARD AHEAD OF THE TROUGH AND AWAY FROM THE U.S.

RECON FOUND THAT THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM IS BETTER THAN
YESTERDAY...WITH A WELL DEFINED 10 N MI DIAMETER CLOSED EYE-WALL BUT
THE HIGHEST SAMPLED WINDS WERE ONLY 65 TO 70 KNOTS. SATELLITE IMAGES
CONTINUE TO SHOW AN IMPRESSIVE CLOUD PATTERN AND SATELLITE WIND
ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB ARE 77 KNOTS. BASED ON RECON REPORTS THE
INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 70 KNOTS IN THIS ADVISORY. 
KEEPING IN MIND THAT WE HAVE LIMITED SKILLS IN PREDICTING CHANGES IN
INTENSITY...I DO NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT COULD STOP THE HURRICANE FROM
STRENGTHENING DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND THAT IS REFLECTED
IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THIS IS SUPPORTED BY SHIPS INTENSITY
FORECAST MODEL WHICH BRINGS DANIELLE TO 100 KNOTS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/12.  DANIELLE HAS NOT TURNED YET BUT THAT IS
NOT EXPECTED UNTIL SUNDAY.  THE KEY PLAYER IS THE MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO BE MOVING OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES
AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY DANIELLE NORTHWARD IN ABOUT 24

DANIELLE CONTINUES TO MOVE TOWARD 300 DEGREES BUT ITS FORWARD SPEED
HAS DECREASED TO ABOUT 9 KT.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE HURRICANE
REACHING THE SOUTHWESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE AS
INITIALIZED IN THE 18Z AVN.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A NARROW
RIDGE EXTENDING FARTHER WEST ALONG 30N.  IT IS THIS FEATURE THAT
IS EXPECTED TO GIVE WAY TOMORROW AS THE TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES
APPROACHES THE EAST COAST.
 
TRACK GUIDANCE LOOKS MUCH LIKE 6 HOURS AGO...BUT THIS IS NO SURPRISE
AS BOTH SETS WERE BASED PRIMARILY ON DATA FROM 12Z.  IF THERE IS TO
BE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IT WOULD LIKELY OCCUR IN THE NEXT ADVISORY
WHICH CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS THAT WILL HAVE
DATA OBTAINED FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF SOUNDINGS DEPLOYED THIS EVENING
BY NOAA G-IV AND P-3 AIRCRAFT IN DANIELLE AND ITS VICINITY.  FOR
NOW...THE TRACK FORECAST CONTINUES TO SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH
IN ABOUT 24 HOURS AND THEN A NORTHEASTWARD MOTION BY 48 HOURS.  THIS
IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT GUIDANCE.  NO AVAILABLE MODEL TRACK
CROSSES 75W.
 
THE NOAA HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION...HRD...HAS TRANSMITTED TO THE
NHC FOR THE FIRST TIME AN ANALYSIS OF DOPPLER RADAR WINDS OBTAINED
ONBOARD THE NOAA P-3S.  IT SHOWS A BAND OF HURRICANE FORCE WINDS IN
THE NORTHWEST SEMICIRCLE AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 3000 FT.  WHILE THE
HURRICANE HUNTERS HAVE FOUND FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS AT 5000 FT NO HIGHER
THAN 67 KT...A NOAA DROPSONDE RELEASED INTO THE EYEWALL HAD WINDS AS
STRONG AS 77 KT AT THE ALTITUDE CORRESPONDING TO 963 MB...AND 57 KT
AT THE SURFACE.  OUR ESTIMATED MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS ARE NOW 65 KT.
 
ALSO WITH HRDS ASSISTANCE...IT APPEARS THAT DURING THE NEXT 48 HOURS
DANIELLE WILL BE MOVING OVER SEVERAL PATCHES OF WATERS PREVIOUSLY
COOLED BY BONNIE/S PASSAGE.  THIS COULD BE A LIMITING FACTOR FOR
DEVELOPMENT AND THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS ADJUSTED DOWNWARD.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 300/09.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS GUIDANCE...SHOWING A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH
AND NORTHEAST AS A TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES RECURVES THE HURRICANE. 
THIS IS BASED ON LOTS OF DATA OVER THE OCEAN FROM AN INTENSIVE MULTI
AIRCRAFT MISSION LAST NIGHT.  THE OFFICAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED
SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BUT IS STILL LEFT OF
MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.

THE HIGHEST RECON WIND FROM THE MOST RECENT FLIGHT WAS 69 KNOTS AT
850 MB IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE RECON REPORTED THAT THE
EYEWALL HAD FALLEN APART AT 03Z BUT WAS AGAIN IDENTIFIABLE AT 05Z
WITH A 20 NMI DIAMETER.  THEREFORE THE INITIAL WIND SPEED REMAINS AT
65 KNOTS.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL SHOWS GRADUAL STRENGTHENING AS
DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...EVEN THOUGH THE SSTS WERE COOLED SOME
BY BONNIES PASSAGE.  THE SSTS ARE STILL ABOVE 86C AND THERE IS
LITTLE VERTICAL SHEAR NEARBY.

TRACK FORECAST OR REASONING.  A GRADUAL TURN TO THE RIGHT...IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ALL OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE...IS EXPECTED.  A BROAD MID-

PRESSURE IS 988 MB...ABOUT THE SAME AS 12 HOURS AGO. DANIELLE IS NOW
MOVING OVER THE PATH OF BONNIE...AND THE PASSAGE OF THE PREVIOUS
HURRICANE HAS LIKELY COOLED THE SST IN THE AREA.  THIS MAY BE

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER  27
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT SUN AUG 30 1998
 
THE LATEST VORTEX DATA FROM AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT SHOWED A MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND OF 70-KNOTS IN THE 
NORTHEAST QUADRANT...A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 983 MB...AND
A 20 NMI DIAMETER EYE.  THIS DATA SUGGESTS THAT DANIELLE IS GOING
THROUGH AN INTENSIFICATION CYCLE...AND THE CURRENT INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS INCREASED TO 70 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  NOAA P-3
ON-BOARD DOPPLER RADAR IMAGES AND WIND/PRESSURE PLOTS SUPPLIED BY
THE HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION...HRD...INDICATE THAT THE DANIELLE
HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS WITH A TIGHTER
MORE WELL-DEFINED CIRCULATION.  HOWEVER...BOTH DOPPLER RADAR AND
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM REMAINS ASYMMETRIC WITH 
THE STRONGEST CONVECTION CONFINED TO THE WEST OF THE CENTER.
   
THE NOAA P-3 AIRCRAFT GPS-DROPSONDE REPORTED A SST OF 26 DEG C
SOUTH OF THE EYE.  SST ANALYSES THROUGH 22 AUG SUGGEST THAT THIS
REPRESENTS ABOUT A 4 DEG C COOLING ATTRIBUTABLE TO BONNIE.  SOME
GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST ALONG THE LINES OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AS DANIELLE MOVES AWAY FROM THE BONNIE/S COOL WAKE AND
INTO WARMER WATERS.  
 
POSITION FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE AND NOAA P-3 RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT SUGGEST THAT THE GRADUAL RIGHT-HAND TURN IS UNDER WAY. 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 325/05 KNOTS.  THE NOAA G-IV 
JET AIRCRAFT PERFORMED A SYNOPTIC FLOW MISSION THIS AFTERNOON TO
SAMPLE THE STEERING ENVIRONMENT NORTH OF DANIELLE.  THIS DATA
INDICATES THAT THE BROAD 500 MB TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
CONTINUES TO ERODE THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND SHOULD PERMIT DANIELLE
TO TAKE A NORTH...THEN NORTHEASTERLY TRACK THE NEXT 12 TO 36 HOURS. 
ALL OF THE AVAILABLE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE THIS SCENARIO
...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK...WITH A MARKED ACCELERATION
BEYOND 48 HOURS. THIS FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS FAR ENOUGH WEST OF BERMUDA TO
PRECLUDE ANY WATCH ISSUANCES AT THIS TIME.

THE MOTION OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS WAS 335/05 AND OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS APPEARS TO BE EVEN MORE NORTHWARD.  THE MOTION CONTINUES TO
CLOSELY FOLLOW THE FORECAST TRACK.  THE NEW MODEL GUIDANCE IS AGAIN
BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE SET OF OBSERVATIONS FROM A MULTIPLE-AIRCRAFT
MISSION OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC AND CONTINUES TO SHOW THE
SAME RECURVATURE SCENARIO AS BEFORE.  SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS VERY SIMILAR TO...AND AN UPDATE OF...THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE
FORECAST TRACK HAS A FORWARD MOTION OF ABOUT 8 KNOTS FOR 24 HOURS
AND ACCELERATING TO 30 KNOTS AT 48 HOURS.
 
RECON REPORTED A CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE OF 980 MB AND A MAX 700-
MB WIND OF 74 KNOTS NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER ALONG WITH A 20 NMI
DIAMETER EYE...SO THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 70 KNOTS.  THE
FORECAST IS FOR GRADUAL STRENGTHENING...THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND FOLLOWS THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL THROUGH 36

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER  29
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON AUG 31 1998

DANIELLE HAS A FAIRLY CLASSICAL PRESENTATION ON THIS MORNINGS
VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES.  THE AIR FORCE PLANE REPORTED A CLOSED
WALL AND A 20 N MI DIAMETER EYE.  LATEST CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS DOWN
TO 976 MB AND MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 85
KNOTS...MAKING DANIELLE A CATEGORY TWO ON THE SAFFIR/SIMPSON
HURRICANE SCALE.   OUTFLOW IS GOOD EXCEPT TO THE SOUTHWEST WHERE A
REMNANT UPPER LOW NEAR FLORIDA IS INTERFERING A BIT.   THE SYSTEM
SHOULD BE MOVING OVER FAIRLY WARM WATERS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR
SO...SO SOME FURTHER INTENSIFICATION IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.

INITIAL MOTION IS NORTH...010/08.  SO FAR...DANIELLE HAS BEEN WELL-
BEHAVED AND THE GUIDANCE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT.  THE HURRICANE
WILL LIKELY BE MAKING CONTACT WITH STRONGER SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING
WINDS IN A DAY OR TWO.  THE LATEST SUITE OF MODEL TRACKS PRETTY MUCH
AGREE ON A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST BUT DIFFER SOMEWHAT ON FORWARD
SPEED.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS MOSTLY AN EXTENSION OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE(S).

HURRICANE DANIELLE DISCUSSION NUMBER  30
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON AUG 31 1998

ALTHOUGH THE CLOUD TOPS ARE NOT VERY COLD...THE HURRICANE CONTINUES
TO LOOK IMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE PICTURES AND RECON STILL REPORTS A
CLOSED WALL...A 20 N MI DIAMETER EYE...AND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 975
MB.  CURRENT MAXIMUM WIND SPEED ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 85 KNOTS.  
DANIELLE SHOULD REMAIN OVER WARM WATERS FOR ANOTHER 24 HOURS OR
SO...SO THERE MAY BE SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING.  THE SHIPS MODEL
ALSO SHOWS A LITTLE INCREASE IN WINDS.   

INITIAL MOTION IS NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD...025/09.  THE CONSENSUS OF
THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS IS A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST AND
ACCELERATION...AWAY FROM THE U.S. EAST COAST.  THIS IS QUALITATIVELY
CONSISTENT WITH THE OBSERVED STEERING FLOW.  THE LATEST NHC FORECAST
TRACK IS PRACTICALLY AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL
FORECAST...AND TAKES THE HURRICANE BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE CANADIAN
MARITIMES.  OBVIOUSLY...INTERESTS IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED LOCALES
SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE HURRICANE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS OR UNTIL DANIELLE HAS PASSED THEIR AREA.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON AUG 31 1998
 
AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS REPORTED A 20 NMI DIAMETER EYE WITH A
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 973 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGERY STILL SHOWS A
WELL-DEFINED EYE ALTHOUGH THE EYE IS NOT EMBEDDED WITHIN A VERY COLD
CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST.  INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 85 KNOTS.  THE
USUAL DILEMMA IS FACED CONCERNING THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH LOCATED JUST
TO THE NORTHWEST OF DANIELLE...AS TO WHETHER IT WILL ENHANCE THE
OUTFLOW RESULTING IN STRENGTHENING...OR INCREASE THE SHEAR RESULTING
IN WEAKENING.  OUR INTENSITY FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE AND
SUGGESTS SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING WHILE DANIELLE IS OVER WARM
WATER.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 025/10.   THE STEERING FLOW IS FORECAST
TO BECOME STRONGER AND MORE SOUTHWESTERLY WITH TIME.  CURRENT TRACK
IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...AND IS MIDWAY BETWEEN THE
NAVY NOGAPS AND THE GFDL.

ISSUED FOR THAT ISLAND.
 
THE OFFICIAL TRACK LIES ALONG THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE AND
SHOWS ACCELERATION IN LINE WITH THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS.  THE AVN
OUTPUT SUGGESTS THAT THE SYSTEM WILL BECOME ELONGATED BY 36 TO 48
HOURS...INDICATIVE OF DANIELLE STARTING TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL.
 
HURRICANE HUNTERS FOUND THAT THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DROPPED TO 968

THE CANADIAN WEATHER SERVICE CALLED IN A REPORT FROM ONE OF THEIR
OFFSHORE BUOYS...44141 LOCATED NEAR 42.1N 56.2W...WHICH RECORDED
A 66 KNOT WIND...A 976 MB PRESSURE AND 21 FOOT SEAS AT 07Z.  THE
INITIAL INTENSITY OF 65 KNOTS WILL BE MAINTAINED AND HELD FOR 12
HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE SYSTEM WILL ENTER PROGRESSIVELY COOLER
SST/S AND GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST AS DANIELLE HEADS EASTWARD
INTO THE OPEN ATLANTIC. THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTRA-
TROPICAL BY 24 HOURS.

BASED ON COORDINATION WITH THE MARINE PREDICTION CENTER...MPC...
IN WASHINGTON D.C. THE 34-KNOT AND 50-KNOT RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED
OUTWARD AS THE SYSTEM TRANSITIONS TO AN EXTRA-TROPICAL LOW. 
 
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE REMAINS VERY CONSISTENT FROM PREVIOUS PACKAGE
AS THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST
U.S. SHOULD CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE DANIELLE NORTHEASTWARD FOR THE
NEXT 12 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL TURN TOWARDS THE EAST AND A SLIGHT
DECELERATION BEYOND 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS VERY
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THE
FORECAST IS TERMINATED BY 48 HOURS AS THE SYSTEM BECOMES EXTRA-
TROPICAL.

WE APPRECIATE THE COORDINATION CALL FROM THE CANADIAN WEATHER
SERVICE REGARDING THE BUOY DATA AND FORECAST TRACK...AND TO MPC 
FOR COORDINATION OF THE WIND RADII AND TRACK FORECAST.

TROPICAL STORM EARL DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON AUG 31 1998

AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE INVESTIGATED THE LARGE AREA OF
DISTURBED WEATHER OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO AND FOUND A 1002 MB LOW
PRESSURE CENTER WITH PEAK WINDS TO 43 KNOTS AT THE 1500 FT FLIGHT
LEVEL.  THEREFORE THE SYSTEM IS BEING UPGRADED IMMEDIATELY TO A
TROPICAL STORM.  THIS IS IN FACT THE SAME SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN
TRACKED ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN SEA DURING THE PAST WEEK. 
AT THIS TIME... THE STORM IS BROAD AND DISORGANIZED AND IS STILL IN
THE FORMATIVE STAGES.  THE OUTFLOW IS CURRENTLY RESTRICTED TO THE
WEST BUT UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE FORECAST TO BECOME MORE FAVORABLE AND
EARL COULD BECOME A HURRICANE.  STRENGTHENING IS ALSO CALLED FOR BY
THE NUMERICAL MODELS.

INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO A LACK OF GOOD CENTER FIXES.  OUR
BEST ESTIMATE IS 350/4.  TRACK PREDICTION MODELS SHOW A TURN TO THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST OR NORTHEAST WITH SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED. 
THIS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE STORM BEING STEERED BY THE FLOW
ASSOCIATED WITH A MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH THAT IS FORECAST TO MOVE
ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES ALONG WITH THIS REASONING. HOWEVER...THE
NOGAPS AND UK MET OFFICE MODEL SUGGEST A MUCH SLOWER MOTION.

IF THE ACCELERATING SCENARIO MATERIALIZES...A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE
NECESSARY LATER TONIGHT.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON AUG 31 1998
 
THE MOST RECENT DATA RECEIVED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT INDICATE THAT EARL IS STILL IN ITS
FORMATIVE STAGES.  THE CENTER FIXES HAVE BEEN JUMPING AROUND AND
ARE SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY POSITION.  ON THIS BASIS
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NEARLY STATIONARY.  EARL IS EXPECTED
TO RESUME A SLOW NORTHERLY MOTION TUESDAY. 
 
THE LATEST VORTEX MESSAGE FROM THE RECON AIRCRAFT SHOWS THAT THE
PRESSURE REMAINS STEADY AT 1002 MB WITH ESTIMATED SURFACE WINDS OF
35 KNOTS.  ACCORDINGLY...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 35
KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM HAS A RATHER LARGE STORM ENVELOPE AS SEEN IN
SATELLITE IMAGERY.  THE OUTFLOW REMAINS RESTRICTED OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE BUT UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE FORECAST TO BECOME MORE
FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING.  THE INTENSITY TREND FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY IS RETAINED WHICH BRINGS EARL TO HURRICANE STATUS BY 48
HOURS.

THE SYNOPTIC REASONING BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE WITH A NORTH-NORTHEAST THEN NORTHEAST HEADING
..ALONG WITH AN INCREASE FORWARD SPEED BEYOND 24 HOURS...IN RESPONSE
TO A MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY REGION DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.  THE MAJORITY OF THE 00Z
TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ADVERTISE THIS SCENARIO...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK.  IF FACT...THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS IN VERY CLOSE
AGREEMENT WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE
NAVY NOGAPS AND THE UKMET MODELS BOTH SHOW THE TROUGH BY-PASSING
EARL...LEAVING THE SYSTEM OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  
 
BASED ON THE CURRENT POSITION ESTIMATES...A HURRICANE WATCH WILL
LIKELY BE REQUIRED SOMETIME TUESDAY.

IT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO LOCATE A CENTER ON INFRARED AND THE LAST
RECON WAS AT 00Z.  IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE MOTION IS NEARLY
STATIONARY.   THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS SLOWER THAN LAST ADVISORY AND
SUGGESTS A SHIFT TO THE LEFT.  THE GFDL HAS THE CENTER NEAR THE
LOUISIANA COAST IN 72 HOURS...THE UKMET IS SLOWER...AND THE NOGAPS
IS NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
IS SLOWER AND A LITTLE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
A BURSTING CDO PATTERN OVERNIGHT IS DYING OUT.  THE INITIAL WIND
SPEED IS LEFT AT 35 KNOTS...ASSUMING THE CENTER IS NORTH OF THE
DEEPEST CONVECTION...AS BEFORE.   THE SHIPS MODEL BRINGS EARL TO 60
KNOTS AT 73 HOURS WHILE THE GFDL GOES TO 100 KNOTS BY 48 HOURS.  THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS NOT CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY BRINGING EARL TO 65 KNOTS IN 48 HOURS.
 
THE SLOWER FORECAST TRACK SUGGESTS THAT A WATCH FOR THE NORTHERN

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT TUE SEP 01 1998
 
EARL IS A DEVELOPING TROPICAL CYCLONE AND SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE
THAT IT IS BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED.  A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE FOUND
AN ELONGATED CENTER  OF 999 MB AND THE WIND FIELD IS STILL VERY
ASYMMETRIC. MOST OF THE STRONGEST WINDS ARE WITHIN A BAND TO THE
SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER. FLIGHT-LEVEL PEAK WINDS OF 61 KNOTS WERE
RECENTLY REPORTED. THERE IS SOME SHEARING OVER THE SYSTEM BUT IT IS
FORECAST TO DECREASE AND INDEED SOME UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS
BEGINNING TO DEVELOP OVER THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE STORM . SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL INTENSIFY EARL AND THE GFDL SUGGESTS AN
EXPLOSIVE INTENSIFICATION.   THEREFORE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS
FOR STRENGTHENING.
 
EARL HAS MOVED NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD OR MORE LIKELY IT HAS REFORMED A
LITTLE TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION. THIS MEANS
THE WATCHES OR WARNING MAY BE REQUIRED EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED. DUE
TO THE ONGOING REFORMATION...BOTH INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION ARE
UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME AND ADJUSTMENTS MAYBE NECESSARY.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR A SLOW GENERAL NORTHWARD
MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  HOWEVER...MODELS ARE BEGINNING
TO CHANGE AND THE GFDL...MRF...AND UK ARE TENDING TO THE WEST OF
PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH A BUILDING OF A MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE WESTWARD ACROSS FLORIDA INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF
MEXICO.
 
WE EMPHASIZE THAT ALL INTERESTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO SHOULD MONITOR
THE PROGRESS OF THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TROPICAL CYCLONE.

RECON FIXES AND SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER HAS
REFORMED TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE PREVIOUS POSITION.  THIS MAKES THE
INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.  BEST ESTIMATE IS
020/10.  THIS MOTION WOULD BRING THE CENTER NEAR THE COAST IN ABOUT

BEEN ISSUED ACCORDINGLY. 

SOME TRACK MODELS HAVE BEEN CHANGING THEIR TUNE...PRIMARILY THE
GFDL...WHICH IS MOVING EARL ON A MORE NORTH AND NORTH NORTHEASTERLY
TRACK AND HAS THE CENTER OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE NEAR LAND BY 48
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL BUT SOMEWHAT
FASTER AS SUGGESTED BY OTHER GUIDANCE AND BRINGS THE CENTER NEAR THE
LOUISIANA COAST WITHIN THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.

AIR FORCE RECON SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER HAS AGAIN REFORMED NEARER
TO THE DEEP CONVECTION.  HOWEVER...PART OF THIS MAY REPRESENT REAL
MOTION.  CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 030/9...BUT THIS IS HIGHLY
UNCERTAIN.  BECAUSE OF THE REVISED CENTER POSITION THE FORECAST
TRACK NEEDS TO BE SHIFTED TO THE EAST OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.  TRACK
GUIDANCE REMAINS DIVERSE.  SOME OF THE MODELS DO NOT HAVE EARL
GETTING CAUGHT UP INTO THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF A MID-
TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE EAST-CENTRAL UNITED STATES...AND LEAVE
IT MEANDERING NEAR THE NORTHWEST GULF COAST.  A RATHER EXTENSIVE
SAMPLING OF THE GULF OF MEXICO WITH GPS DROPWINDSONDES BY THE G-4
JET SHOWS A 500 MB TROUGH EXTENDING INTO THE CENTRAL GULF.  THESE
DATA ALSO SHOW...HOWEVER..THAT EARL DOES NOT HAVE MUCH OF A
SIGNATURE AT THAT LEVEL...SUGGESTING A RATHER SHALLOW SYSTEM THAT
MAY NOT RESPOND TO DEEPER-LAYER STEERING.  

ALTHOUGH THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF DEEP CONVECTION...EARL DOES NOT
LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE IN TERMS OF ORGANIZATION ON SATELLITE IMAGES.
IN FACT...IT DOES NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE A TROPICAL STORM AT THIS TIME. 
THE STORM REMAINS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF WESTERLY SHEAR...AND THIS MAY
PREVENT ANY SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING BEFORE LANDFALL.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST STILL ACKNOWLEDGES THE CHANCE THAT EARL COULD REACH
HURRICANE STRENGTH BEFORE REACHING THE COAST.  IN ANY EVENT THERE IS
A FAIRLY LARGE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION WITH A BROAD AREA OF STRONG
WINDS MAINLY EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.

SAB SATELLITE FIXES ARE 110 NMI APART.  THE PAST 24 HOUR MOTION IS
030/10.  THE PAST 6 HOUR MOTION IS STATIONARY.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH
IS CLOSER TO BEING RIGHT.  THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL AND THE ETA SHOW
VERY SLOW NORTHEAST AND THEN NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR 48 HOURS...CUT
OFF FROM THE WESTERLIES.  THE NOGAPS AND UKMET ALSO SHOW VERY SLOW
MOTION FOR 72 HOURS.  IN CONTRAST...THE 00Z GFDL AND LBAR
ACCELERATES THE STORM NORTHEASTWARD...UNDER 10 KNOTS FOR 24 HOURS
THEN NEAR 20 KNOTS BY 48 HOURS...INDICATING EARL GETTING PICKED UP
BY WESTERLIES...BUT NOT REAL FAST.
 
THE OFFICIAL INITIAL MOTION FOR 09Z IS 045/08...A COMPROMISE AVERAGE
OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITES.  THE FORECAST TRACK CONTINUES THIS
FORWARD SPEED FOR 24 HOURS...OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE GFDL AND THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  AFTER 24 HOURS THE FORECAST IS A SLOW NORTHWARD
DRIFT...RESPECTING THE OTHER GUIDANCE.
 
GPS DROPS FROM THE GULFSTREAM AIRCRAFT EARLIER SHOWED A 500 MB
TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES WITH A POSSIBLE LOW JUST SOUTH OF EASTERN
LOUISIANA.  THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS SOUTHWEST OF THE 500 MB LOW.
THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE STRICTLY TROPICAL.  THE DEEPEST
CONVECTION IS IN TWO AREAS...ONE CDO TYPE NEAR THE CENTER AND THE
OTHER ELONGATED EAST OF THE CENTER.  THE MAXIMUM RECON WIND WAS 51
KNOTS AT 1500 FT AND BUOYS AND RIGS ALL SHOW THAT EARLY IS A 45 KNOT
STORM.  IT IS STILL WARM CORE AT 1500 FT HOWEVER AND...FOR ALL I
KNOW...INTENSIFICATION IS STILL POSSIBLE.  I AM RELUCTANT TO CHANGE
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TO REACH 65 KNOTS BEFORE LANDFALL EVEN THOUGH
IT MAY NOT BE THE MOST LIKELY POSSIBILITY.

WARNINGS ARE SHIFTED A LITTLE EASTWARD AS IS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK.

FORMING.
 
THE CENTER OF THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN ROTATING AROUND A MUCH LARGER
CIRCULATION MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE OVERALL INITIAL
MOTION. IT APPEARS THAT EARL HAS BEGUN TO MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST
ABOUT 8 KNOTS BUT THIS ALSO COULD ANOTHER EASTWARD SHIFT OR

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES WITH PERSISTENCE AND CONTINUES WITH A
GENERAL NORTHEASTWARD TRACK. THIS APPEARS TO BE THE BEST OPTION AT
THIS TIME.  ON THIS TRACK THE DIFFUSE CENTER WILL BE NEAR THE COAST
WITHIN THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 12 HOURS.  

DUE TO HIGH UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST...WATCHES AND WARNINGS
REMAIN UNCHANGED AT THIS TIME.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT WED SEP 02 1998
 
EARL CONTINUES TO HAVE A NON-CLASSICAL CLOUD PATTERN...TO SAY THE
LEAST.  ENHANCED INFRARED IMAGERY SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT OVERALL
WARMING OF THE CLOUD TOPS AND LESS ORGANIZATION...WHICH SUGGESTS
WEAKENING.  FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS AND DROPWINDSONDE DATA FROM THE AIR
FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS INDICATE THAT EARL HAS DROPPED BACK TO
CATEGORY ONE INTENSITY.  NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN INTENSITY IS
EXPECTED BEFORE LANDFALL.
 
STRONG WINDS EXTEND WELL OUT FROM THE CENTER OVER THE EASTERN
SEMICIRCLE.  THIS WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE A SERIOUS STORM SURGE
PROBLEM IN THE BIG BEND AREA OF FLORIDA.
 
THE RECON DATA SHOWS THAT THE CENTER REMAINS BROAD AND DIFFUSE...AND
FIXES FROM WSR-88D RADAR ARE RATHER POOR.  THIS CONTINUES TO MAKE IT
DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE INITIAL MOTION.  THE CURRENT ESTIMATE IS
060/09.  TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS HAVE NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR
PREDICTING EARL...SO EXTRAPOLATION OF THE CURRENT MOVEMENT IS A
PRIMARY FORECAST TOOL IN THIS CASE.  BASED ON A SLIGHTLY MORE
EASTWARD INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE...THE LATEST OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A
LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.  THE FORECAST BASICALLY
CONTINUES AN EAST-NORTHEASTWARD TO NORTHEASTWARD MOTION AT ABOUT THE
SAME SPEED FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

RADAR AND SURFACE DATA SHOW THE CENTER OF EARL ACCELERATING
NORTHEASTWARD THROUGH GEORGIA.  CURRENT MOTION IS 50 DEGREES AT
ABOUT 17 KT.  THEY ALSO SHOW A SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED CIRCULATION
...AND MAXIMUM WINDS ARE NOW ESTIMATED TO BE 40 KT...AND THESE ARE
PROBABLY LIMITED TO THUNDERSTORMS NEAR THE CENTER.  GUSTS TO
TROPICAL STORM FORCE ARE ALSO OCCURRING OVER THE ATLANTIC COASTAL
WATERS OFF GEORGIA.
 
THE CURRENT MOTION AND GUIDANCE HAVE LED TO A FORECAST MOTION THAT
IS CONSIDERABLY FASTER THAN 6 HOURS AGO.  THE TRACK OF THE CENTER IS
EXPECTED TO EMERGE OFF THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST IN 24 TO 36 HOURS. 
WEAKENING SHOULD CONTINUE IN THE INTERIM AND SUSTAINED WINDS ARE
EXPECTED TO DROP BELOW STORM STRENGTH TODAY.  THE SYSTEM CONTINUES
TO GRADUALLY LOSE ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND WE ARE
FORECASTING IT TO BE EXTRATROPICAL WHEN IT LEAVES THE COAST.  THAT
IS BY NO MEANS A CERTAINTY AND THE SYSTEM IS THEN LIKELY TO STILL
HAVE A STRONG CIRCULATION ALOFT.  THEREFORE...WHILE THIS IS INTENDED
TO BE THE FINAL ADVISORY ON EARL FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE
CENTER...WE WILL RESUME ADVISORIES IF THE SYSTEM AGAIN BECOMES A
COASTAL OR OFFSHORE THREAT AS A TROPICAL EVENT. 

UNTIL THEN...INFORMATION ON THIS SYSTEM WILL BE PROVIDED IN

LARGE BROAD CIRCULATION AND SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THERE IS
ENOUGH DEEP ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO CLASSIFY THE SYSTEM AS A

STAGES AND A CONSISTENT CENTER WILL LIKELY BE VERY DIFFICULT TO
TRACK.  BECAUSE MOST OF THE MODELS ARE RELAXING THE SHEAR...SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED.  THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO BECOME
A TROPICAL STORM BEFORE REACHING THE COAST.
 
THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO SLOWLY MOVE TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST AS
THE RIGDE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.  HOWEVER...THE

WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A VERY POORLY ORGANIZED LOW PRESSURE AREA IN
THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO.  IF THE SYSTEM HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN
DESIGNATED AS A DEPRESSION...I WOULD NOT DO SO AT THIS TIME.  BUOY
REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE CIRCULATION IS EVEN LESS WELL
ORGANIZED THAN SIX HOURS AGO.  WITH NO EVIDENCE OF ANY MOTION...THE
INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE STATIONARY.  THE MODEL GUIDANCE
SHOWS A SLOW WEST THROUGH NORTHWEST MOTION... DEPENDING ON THE
MODEL.  THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL LOCATES THE CENTER WELL SOUTH OF
WHERE WE HAVE IT...BUT THE AVIATION MODEL COULD TURN OUT TO BE
CORRECT.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...BUT ALONG THE SAME PATH REACHING THE TEXAS COAST IN 36
HOURS.
 
THE DEEP CONVECTION IS LOCATED WELL EAST AND SOUTH OF OUR CENTER.
PERHAPS THIS CONVECTION WILL ORGANIZE INTO A BANDING FEATURE WITH
TIME...BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS LITTLE ORGANIZATION AND NO SIGNS
OF DEVELOPMENT.  BUT THERE IS LITTLE VERTICAL SHEAR IN THE VICINITY

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT ALTHOUGH THE COVERAGE OF DEEP
CONVECTION HAS INCREASED TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIX IS STILL
DISORGANIZED.  THE LATEST RECONNAISSANCE DATA RECEIVED FROM THE 
AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE
CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIX REMAINS BROAD AND ILL-DEFINED. 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS FINALLY ABLE TO CLOSE OFF A CENTER BUT REPORTS AN
ACCURACY OF 45 NMI. MEANWHILE A RADAR CENTER FIX ESTIMATE FROM THE
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR IS ABOUT 100 MILES NORTHWEST
OF THE AIRCRAFT POSITION.  SO...WITH THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY
SURROUNDING THE EXACT CENTER LOCATION WE WILL USE THE SAME CENTER
POSITION FROM THE 06Z ADVISORY UNTIL A MORE DEFINITIVE CENTER
EMERGES.  

RECON DATA SHOWS THAT THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DROP 1 MB AND
IS NOW 998 MB.  MEANWHILE THE STRONGEST FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS...35-39
KNOTS...ARE 60-90 MILES NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  12Z BUOY AND SHIP
DATA CONTINUES TO SHOW 20 TO 30 KNOT WINDS...WITH NCDC BUOY 42002 IS
REPORTING A EAST-NORTHEAST WIND OF 22 KNOTS AND A 999.9 MB PRESSURE.

THE SYSTEM WILL BE HELD AT TROPICAL DEPRESSION STATUS...30 KNOTS...
WITH GUSTS TO 45 KNOTS.  THE INTENSITY TREND FROM THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE WILL BE MAINTAINED WITH THE SYSTEM FORECAST TO A TROPICAL
STORM WITHIN 12 HOURS. 

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS STATIONARY.  THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE
IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE 06Z SUITE SHOWING CONSIDERABLE SCATTER
ALTHOUGH THE CONSENSUS IS STILL WEST-NORTHWEST. THE GFDL...WHICH HAS
A LEFT BIAS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO... IS THE LEFT-MOST OF ALL THE
GUIDANCE SHOWING A SOUTHWEST HEADING.  THIS SEEMS INCONSISTENT WITH
THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN OF A MID-LEVEL NORTHWEST-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED
RIDGE.  DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE CENTER LOCATION THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE PACKAGE FROM 06Z.

THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PATH OF LEAST REGRET UNTIL WE CAN GET A MORE
CLEAR-CUT CENTER POSITION AND SUBSEQUENT MOTION.  THE TROPICAL STORM
WARNINGS REMAIN UNCHANGED.

THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR CORPUS CHRISTI RADAR 24-
HOUR RAINFALL TOTAL OF NEAR 6 INCHES BETWEEN CORPUS AND BROWNSVILLE.

AT 18Z BUOY 42019...LOCATED JUST OFF THE LOWER TEXAS COAST...
REPORTED SUSTAINED WINDS OF 35 KNOTS AT 3 METERS.  THE LAST AIR
FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT REPORTED FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS
OF 40 KNOTS IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT. BASED ON THIS DATA TROPICAL
DEPRESSION SIX IS BEING UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM FRANCES.
 
SEVERAL OIL RIG OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED 40 TO 50 KNOTS WINDS
...AT ABOUT 30 METERS...OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF...DURING THE DAY.
ALTHOUGH THESE STRONG WINDS A LIKELY DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING
OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND
RADII ENCOMPASS THESE WINDS.
 
POSITION ESTIMATES FROM RECONNAISSANCE...RADAR...AND SATELLITE
CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT THE CENTER OF THIS SYSTEM IS BROAD AND POORLY
DEFINED.  HIGH-RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST SEVERAL
VORTICES ARE ROTATING AROUND A LARGER CIRCULATION.  WHILE EARLIER
RECONNAISSANCE WAS ABLE TO FIX A CENTER...ALBEIT WITH 45 NM ACCURACY
...THEY WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE A CENTER ON THE LAST PASS.  WITH THE
OVERALL ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE FOR DEVELOPMENT..I.E. NO APPRECIABLE
WIND SHEAR AND 30C SST...THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP.  THERE
IS A DISTINCT POSSIBLITY THAT THE CENTER WILL REFORM SOUTH OF THE
ADVISORY POSITION.  THUS... WITH THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY
SURROUNDING THE EXACT CENTER LOCATION WE WILL HOLD THE POSITION FROM
THE 12Z ADVISORY UNTIL A MORE DEFINITIVE CENTER EMERGES. THE
INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS SOME GRADUAL STRENGTHENING ALTHOUGH THIS
IS HIGHLY DEPENDANT ON WHERE/IF THE CENTER IS.
 
THE SYSTEM REMAINS STATIONARY.  THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES
TO SHOW HIGHLY DIVERGENT SOLUTIONS.  THE EXTREMES ARE CLIPER WHICH
BRINGS THE SYSTEM NORTH-NORTHEAST WHILE THE GFDL HOOKS FRANCES
SOUTHWEST.  THE MAJORITY OF THE GUIDANCE IS STILL WEST-NORTHWEST
WITH SEVERAL MODELS NOW SHOWING A MORE NORTHWEST HEADING.  THE
GFDL...ALONG WITH THE NGM...SHOWS FRANCES ROTATING SOUTH/SOUTHWEST
ALONG THE MEXICAN COAST. EXAMINATION OF THE LOWER RESOLUTION FIELDS
SUGGEST THAT THE GFDL IS TRACKING A SMALL-SCALE CENTER WITHIN A
LARGER CIRCULATION.  THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN OF A MID-LEVEL NORTHWEST-
SOUTHEAST ORIENTED RIDGE SUPPORTS A GENERALLY WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION.
DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE CENTER LOCATION THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS IDENTICAL TO THE PACKAGE FROM 12Z. THIS SEEMS TO
BE THE PATH OF LEAST REGRET UNTIL WE CAN GET A MORE CLEAR-CUT CENTER
POSITION AND SUBSEQUENT MOTION.
 
BASED ON THE SIZE OF FRANCES THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO HAS ISSUED A
TROPICAL STORM WARNING FROM THE TEXAS/MEXICAN BORDER TO TAMPICO

FRANCES CONSISTS OF A VERY LARGE CYCLONIC GYRE SURROUNDED BY A RING
OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS...WITHOUT A DEFINITIVE TIGHT CENTER.
THIS PATTERN RESEMBLES A MONSOON-TYPE GYRE WHICH IS NOT COMMON IN
THE ATLANTIC BUT IS FREQUENTLY OBSERVED OVER THE WESTERN PACIFIC.
 
AN AIR FORCE PLANE JUST FOUND A CENTER OF 994 MB TO THE SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS POSITION AND BY NO MEANS THIS IS TRANSLATED INTO A
SOUTHWARD MOTION OF THE STORM.  THIS IS BASICALLY A REFORMATION AND
APPEARS TO BE THE DOMINANT AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...SINCE THE
CIRCULATION IS LARGE.. OTHER CENTERS MAY FORM WHILE FRANCES IS IN
FORMATIVE STAGE.  THE CIRCULATION OF FRANCES IS TRYING TO BECOME
MORE CONCENTRATED AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES RISE AND THE
CENTRAL PRESSURE OF THE STORM FALLS.  AN UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS
BECOMING ESTABLISHED OVER THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF OUTFLOW
JETS.  THEREFORE...A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED AND IN
FACT...AN OIL RIG LOCATED ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL AND TO
THE NORTHEAST OF FRANCES JUST REPORTED A GUST TO 83 MPH.  OTHER RIGS
ARE REPORTING GUSTS AROUND 70 MPH.
 
WE SHOULD NOT CONCENTRATE IN THE BROAD CENTER OF FRANCES. INSTEAD
...WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE RING OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS AND
HEAVY RAINS WHICH SURROUNDS THE STORM. THIS ACTIVITY IS ALREADY
AFFECTING THE COASTAL SECTIONS WITHIN THE WARNING AREA AS WELL AS
MUCH OF THE GULF OF MEXICO.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS BRING FRANCES
TOWARD NORTHEASTERN MEXICO IN ABOUT 24 HOURS IN RESPONSE TO A
BUILDING HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND THE
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT KEEPS
FRANCES NEARLY STATIONARY FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS AND THEN MOVES THE

11 AM EDT THU SEP 10 1998
 
TRACKING OF THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE HAS BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE.  THE
CENTER HAS CONTINUED TO REFORM WITHIN A BROADER SCALE CIRCULATION
ENVELOPE...AND ALTHOUGH LATEST CENTER FIXES ARE MORE TO THE NORTH
THIS IS NOT BELIEVED TO REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NORTHWARD
COMPONENT OF MOTION.  IN FACT...THE OVERALL AREA OF PRECIPITATION ON
RADAR APPEARS TO BE SPREADING GENERALLY WESTWARD ACROSS SOUTH TEXAS.
THE STEERING CURRENTS ARE STILL NOT VERY WELL DEFINED...BUT THE NCEP
GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE AN EAST-SOUTHEASTERLY STEERING FLOW TO THE
SOUTH OF A LARGE 500 MB HIGH OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. SO A SLOW
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION TOWARD EXTREME SOUTH TEXAS IS FORECAST.
 
OVERALL THE CYCLONE LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER-ORGANIZED THAN IT DID 24
HOURS AGO.  FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH OF
A CONCENTRATION OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE AREA OF LOWEST PRESSURE. 
RECENT SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW MORE HEAVY SHOWERS FORMING NEAR THE
ESTIMATED CENTER AND IF THIS TREND CONTINUES... STRENGTHENING COULD
OCCUR SINCE THE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT IS ANTICYCLONIC AND THE
VERTICAL SHEAR IS NOT STRONG.

THE STORM CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT A BROAD CENTRAL AREA OF ABOUT EQUAL
PRESSURE...LIGHT WINDS...AND SMALLER-SCALE VORTICES EVIDENT ON HIGH-
RES VISIBLE IMAGERY.  AS SUCH IT IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE A UNIQUE
CENTER.  BUT...AS MENTIONED EARLIER...THE STORM HAS BECOME A LITTLE
BETTER-ORGANIZED AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.  MAXIMUM SUSTAINED
SURFACE WINDS ARE NOW ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 50 KNOTS...WELL NORTHEAST
OF THE CENTER.  RECENTLY...AN OIL RIG NEAR 28N92W REPORTED SUSTAINED
WINDS OF 68 KNOTS WITH GUSTS TO 77 KNOTS MORE THAN 100 FEET ABOVE
SEA LEVEL.  THERE IS AN IMPRESSIVE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE
OVER THE SYSTEM AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS ANALYSES SHOW
LOW VERTICAL SHEAR OVER THE AREA.  FURTHER STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR
BEFORE LANDFALL.
 
EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CENTER SHIFTS OR REFORMATIONS TO
THE NORTH...MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES A MORE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TO
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION.  THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS A 500
MB HIGH PERSISTING NEAR AND TO NORTHEAST OF TEXAS...PROVIDING A WEAK
EAST TO SOUTHEASTERLY STEERING CURRENT.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW FRANCES
TO MOVE INLAND SLOWLY OVER SOUTHERN TEXAS WITHIN IN A DAY OR SO.
 
TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS WERE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THE LOUISIANA COAST
BECAUSE OF THE STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT IN THAT AREA.  IF THE
STRENGTHENING TREND CONTINUES...A HURRICANE WARNING MAY BE REQUIRED
LATER TONIGHT OR EARLY FRIDAY.

FRANCES LOOKS MORE LIKE A TROPICAL STORM ON SATELLITE TONIGHT THAN
ANY OTHER TIME BEFORE.  THERE IS A CONCENTRATED AREA OF STRONG
SQUALLS JUST TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER WHERE DOPPLER WINDS
ALOFT HAVE REACH 70 KNOTS. RECON JUST FOUND A BROAD 995 MB PRESSURE
CENTER AND 59-KNOT WINDS.

MOST OF THE SEVERE WEATHER HAS ALREADY REACHED THE MID TO UPPER
TEXAS COAST AND THESE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PERSIST FOR A FEW
MORE HOURS AND GRADUALLY SPREAD INLAND.  THE UPPER LEVEL ENVIRONMENT
IS FAVORABLE FOR INTENSIFICATION BUT MUCH OF THE CIRCULATION IS
ALREADY OVER LAND.  THEREFORE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS
EXPECTED BEFORE THE CENTER REACHES THE COAST WITHIN 12 HOURS OR SO.
 
FRANCES IS STILL MEANDERING BUT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS EXPECTED TO
MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST ABOUT 5 KNOTS. THIS GENERAL MOTION IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS THE 500 MB
RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THIS IS SUGGESTED
BY MOST OF THE MODELS...ALTHOUGH THE SPEED VARIES AMONG THE MODELS.
 
SEVERE FLOODING FROM STORM SURGE AND RAIN IS OCCURRING ALONG THE MID
TO UPPER TEXAS COAST. DETAILS ARE INCLUDED IN STATEMENTS FROM LOCAL
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE FORECAST OFFICES. ONCE FRANCES MAKES
LANDFALL...A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS INDICATED BUT VERY HEAVY RAINS AND
FLOODING ARE EXPECTED OVER A LARGE PORTION OF TEXAS DURING THE NEXT
FEW DAYS DUE TO THE SLOW MOTION OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.

RADAR AND RECON DATA SHOWED THE CENTER OF FRANCES MAKING LANDFALL
BETWEEN PORT ARANSAS AND PORT OCONNOR AROUND 06Z.  THE CENTER HAS
PROGRESSED INLAND DURING THE FOLLOWING FEW HOURS ON A HEADING OF
ABOUT 315 DEGREES AT AROUND 12 KT.  WHILE THE WINDS NEAR THE CENTER
SHOULD ABATE...THE OFFSHORE CONDITIONS WILL BE IMPROVING RATHER
SLOWLY.
 
NUMERICAL GUIDANCE FROM LARGE-SCALE MODELS AND TRACK PREDICTION
SCHEMES GENERALLY SHOW A CONTINUATION OF THIS MOTION FOR THE NEXT
24-36 HOURS WITH SOME DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED...AS DOES THE
NHC FORECAST.  THEREAFTER...THERE IS DIVERGENCE WITH SOME MODELS
TAKING THE REMNANTS TOWARD THE NORTH AND OTHERS SUGGESTING A DUE
WESTWARD HEADING.  ON THIS FORECAST CYCLE...NONE OF THE GUIDANCE
SHOWS THE SYSTEM STALLING...BUT THE DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED COULD
NEVERTHELESS INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING OVER SOUTH-CENTRAL
TEXAS OVER THE WEEKEND.
 
FLOODING FROM STORM SURGE IS LIKELY TO SLOWLY DIMINISH DURING THE
DAY NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER AND DECREASE MORE QUICKLY TO THE
SOUTHEAST.  DETAILS ARE CONTAINED IN STATEMENTS FROM LOCAL NATIONAL

THE SURFACE CIRCULATION APPEARS TO HAVE BECOME ELONGATED...AS THE
SATELLITE AND RADAR CENTERS ARE WELL WEST OF WHERE SURFACE
OBSERVATIONS FROM VICTORIA TEXAS WOULD PLACE THE CENTER.  SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOWS FRANCES TO BE LOCATED NEAR THE END OF A LARGE SCALE
AND WELL DEFINED FRONTAL ZONE.  PERHAPS FRANCES IS EVOLVING INTO A
WAVE ON A FRONT.  THIS COULD KEEP THE CIRCULATION VIGOROUS FOR SOME
TIME LONGER...AND KEEP THE THREAT OF HEAVY RAIN INLAND FOR LONGER.

THE SABINE C-MAN REPORTED 41 KNOTS AT 12Z AND 31 KNOTS AT 13Z AND 35
KNOTS AT 14Z.  THE WIND IS KEPT AT 35 KNOTS FOR 15Z...BUT WE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO DOWNGRADE FRANCES TO A DEPRESSION AT 18Z AND TAKE DOWN
THE COASTAL WARNINGS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS SLOWED TO 300/07 BECAUSE OF THE
UNCERTAINTY IN THE LOCATION DISCUSSED ABOVE.  THE MODELS ALL SHOW A
SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION FOR 48 HOURS.  THE AVIATION
MODEL AND UKMET AND LBAR SHOW THE SYSTEM MOVING NORTHWARD AFTER 48
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
FOR 48 HOURS AND THEN ADDS THE NORTHWARD MOTION.

THE BROAD CENTER OF THE DEPRESSION HAS BEEN MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS. MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS
SUGGEST THAT THE LOW PRESSURE AREA...REMNANTS OF FRANCES SHOULD MOVE
ON A GENERAL NORTHWARD TRACK AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. 

THE SYSTEM IS GRADUALLY WEAKENING BUT SOME ISOLATED WIND GUSTS OF
TROPICAL STORM FORCE MAY STILL OCCUR OVER WATER WITHIN SOME OF THE
RAINBANDS.  THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE HEAVY RAINS
PRIMARILY OVER EASTERN TEXAS DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY ON FRANCES ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL

SATELLITE LOOPS INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM MOVES SOUTH OF DUE WEST
SINCE YESTERDAY. HOWEVER... A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK IS EXPECTED
THROUGH 72 HOURS SINCE A MID-LEVEL RIDGE IS BUILDING WESTWARD WITH
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LIMITED INITIAL

NO METEOSAT IMAGERY RECEIVED FROM 23Z THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF THIS
FORECAST...BUT AVAILABLE CENTER FIXES WERE A LITTLE TO THE NORTH OF
THE EXPECTED POSITION AND IMPLY A SOMEWHAT SLOWER MOTION THAN
EXPECTATIONS BASED ON THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS AND SHORT-TERM FORECAST.

AS A COMPROMISE...THE INITIAL POSITION HAS BEEN EASED NORTHWARD A
BIT AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 275/15 KT.  THE
SYSTEM RETAINS A SMALL AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND
AN AREA OF THUNDERSTORMS MORE DISTANT TO THE NW.  THE DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES HAVE NOT CHANGED FROM 6 HOURS AGO.  A 01Z
PICTURE RECEIVED JUST BEFORE RELEASE OF THIS ADVISORY SHOWS A MORE
DEVELOPED AND CIRCULAR CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST PATTERN.
 
THE TRACK MODELS ARE FAIRLY CLOSELY CLUSTERED...GENERALLY INDICATING
A WESTWARD...BECOMING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS. 
THE NHC FORECAST IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLUSTER AND A LITTLE TO THE
RIGHT OF THE OFFICIAL TRACK IN THE FIRST ADVISORY.  THIS TRACK
ASSUMES THAT A NARROWING E-W RIDGE TO THE NORTH WILL HOLD...EVEN
WITH THE LARGE TROUGH THAT THE 18Z AVN AND 12Z NOGAPS SHOW
GENERATING WESTERLIES AT 500 MB ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 25-30N OVER MUCH

DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION SEVEN...
WHICH HAD BEEN WANING EARLIER THIS MORNING...HAS MADE A COMEBACK 
PER THE LAST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES. DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES 
FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN 2.0 AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE 
HELD AT 30 KNOTS.
 
THE SYSTEM HAS A LARGE ENVELOPE AND REMAINS FAIRLY WELL ORGANIZED. 
RECENT SATELLITE PICTURES INDICATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BANDING
FEATURE SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER.  THE OUTFLOW IS BECOMING BETTER
ESTABLISHED OVER THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE DEPRESSION WHILE STILL
RESTRICTED TO THE EAST.  WITH SUFFICIENTLY WARM SST/S...28C...AND
ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE
STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SHOWING A LIGHT VERTICAL
SHEAR ENVIRONMENT AHEAD CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR CONTINUED
DEVELOPMENT.  THUS...GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY
PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS. THIS BRINGS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO
HURRICANE STATUS BY 72 HOURS.
 
THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES TO MOVE WESTWARD AT A FAIRLY GOOD CLIP WITH
AN INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE OF 275/16 KNOTS.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE
NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION SHOULD CONTINUE TO STEER THE SYSTEM ON A
GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING THROUGH THE 72 HOURS AS THE WESTERLIES
ASSOCIATED WITH THE LARGE-SCALE TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC
REMAIN NORTH OF 25N...PER THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL OUTPUT. MEANWHILE 
THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL HAS THE TROUGH SLIGHTLY DEEPER RESULTING IN A
WEAKER RIDGE AND A MORE WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.  ITS INTERESTING
TO NOTE THAT THE 00Z UNITED KINGDOM MET OFFICE MODEL LOSES THE
SYSTEM AFTER 24 HOURS WHEREAS THE 15/12Z RUN HELD ON TO THE SYSTEM
THROUGH 72 HOURS.  MOST OF THE 06Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS CLUSTERED
AROUND A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLUSTER AND IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE

WEATHER CENTER IS 3.0. THIS IS THE BASIS FOR UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO
A TROPICAL STORM AT THIS TIME. GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO FORECAST
200 MB EASTERLIES OVER THE DEEP TROPICS AND BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL
BRING THE SYSTEM TO HURRICANE STATUS BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING AND MAKES GEORGES A 70-KNOT HURRICANE BY 72 HOURS.

INITIAL MOTION IS 275/17. THERE IS A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE ANCHORED

FORECAST WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST BEYOND 48 HOURS.
THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH TRACK MODELS PRIMARILY THE GDFL...LBAR AND

ONE SHOULD MENTION THAT THE AVN DEVELOPS A TROPICAL CYCLONE WELL
AHEAD OF GEORGES AND THIS MODEL FEATURE ERODES THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE CURRENTLY STEERING GEORGES. THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE DEVELOPMENT

THE IR IMAGES THIS EVENING SHOW TWO PERSISTENT CLUSTERS OF STRONG
CONVECTION...OCCASIONALLY WITH CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES LOWER THAN
-80C.  THE CENTER IS ESTIMATED TO BE LOCATED BETWEEN THE CLUSTERS.
OUTFLOW ON THE WEST SIDE REMAINS PARTICULARLY WELL-DEVELOPED AND...
WITH DVORAK T-NUMBERS NOW AT 3.0...THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 45
KT.
 
THE MOTION REMAINS JUST NORTH OF DUE WEST AT ABOUT 17 KT...TO THE
SOUTH OF A HIGH DETECTED IN WV IMAGERY.  THE LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE
SUGGESTS THAT THE SHORTWAVE TROUGHS FARTHER TO THE NORTH WILL
CONTINUE BYPASSING GEORGES WITH LITTLE IMPACT ON THE TRACK OF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE AT LEAST INTO THE WEEKEND.  AS INDICATED BY THE
GFDL AND AVN OUTPUT FROM 18Z AND THE NOGAPS FROM 12Z...ONLY A SLOW
ROTATION OF THE HEADING FROM WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED OVER
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE TRACK GIVEN IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST FROM 6 HOURS AGO.
 
THE GFDL AND SHIPS INTENSITY FORECASTS BRING GEORGES TO HURRICANE
STRENGTH IN ABOUT 36 HOURS WITH FURTHER STRENGTHENING THEREAFTER. 
THE NHC FORECAST IMPLIES A LITTLE SLOWER RATE OF INTENSIFICATION.

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY DURING THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS SHOWS THAT
THE TWO PREVIOUSLY SEPARATE CLUSTERS OF DEEP CONVECTION LOCATED ON
EITHER SIDE OF THE CENTER HAVE MERGED.  THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN
HAS IMPROVED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS WITH THE EXPANSION OF DEEP
CONVECTION AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE.  CLOUD-DRIFT WIND DATA SUGGESTS THAT EASTERLY SHEAR
IS HINDERING THE OUTFLOW DEVELOPMENT OVER EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE
SYSTEM.  DVORAK CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.
REMAIN 45 KNOTS...AS WILL THE INITIAL INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY.
 
GLOBAL MODEL OUTPUT SUGGEST THAT CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE FOR
CONTINUED INTENSIFICATION AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS GEORGES
TO HURRICANE STATUS BY 36 HOURS...WITH FURTHER STRENGTHENING
THEREAFTER.  THIS IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS.
 
SATELLITE FIXES INDICATE THAT GEORGES CONTINUES TO MOVE JUST NORTH
OF DUE WEST AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 275/17 KNOTS.
THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF GEORGES SHOULD CONTINUE STEERING THE
SYSTEM ON A GENERAL WESTWARD COURSE THROUGH 36 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL
TURN TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST THEREAFTER.  GEORGES IS EXPECTED TO
REMAIN FAR ENOUGH SOUTH THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD TO LESSEN THE
INFLUENCE OF THE LARGE-SCALE CENTRAL ATLANTIC TROUGH.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH CLIPER AND LBAR...AND IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

A SEQUENCE OF SSMI IMAGES DURING THE LAST 12 HOURS...COURTESY OF NRL
MONTEREY HOMEPAGE...INDICATE THAT THE INNER CORE OF GEORGES IS
GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED. THESE IMAGES REVEAL THAT THERE
IS ALMOST A CLOSED EYEWALL.  THIS COINCIDES WITH EARLIER VISIBLE
METEOSAT IMAGES THAT SUGGESTED AN EYE WAS TRYING TO FORM BUT
CONVECTION DOES NOT SUPPORT SUCH FEATURE.  IN FACT...THE APPARENT
EYE IS NO LONGER CLEARLY OBSERVED AND T-NUMBERS REMAIN ABOUT 3.0 ON
THE DVORAK SCALE.  ALL OF THE ABOVE JUSTIFIES THAT THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS AT LEAST 50 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  THE AVAILABLE GLOBAL
MODELS MAINTAIN A 200 MB HIGH WITH EASTERLIES OVER THE DEEP TROPICS
THROUGH 72 HOURS.  SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL BRINGS GEORGES TO
86 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS AND THE GFDL ALSO STRENGTHENS THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO HURRICANE STATUS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
SHIPS BRINGING GEORGES TO 85 KNOTS BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  IF THE EYE DEVELOPS DURING THE DAY...GEORGES MAY BE
UPGRADED TO HURRICANE STATUS SOONER THAN ANTICIPATED. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 275/17. A DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. THIS PATTERN SUPPORTS
A CONTINUED MOTION SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST THROUGH THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THIS IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY GFDL...LBAR AND UK MODELS.

NOTE: 5-DAY GFDL AND LBAR BRING GEORGES OVER THE NORTHEASTERN

THE HEADING IS 280/16 KT WHICH IS A DECREASE FROM 24 HOURS AGO WHERE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SAT SEP 19 1998

RECONNAISSANCE PLANE FOUND FLIGHT-LEVEL PEAK WINDS OF 146 KNOTS NEAR
IN THE EYEWALL. A DROP IN THE EYEWALL JUST MEASURED 119 KNOTS WHICH
IS AN AVERAGE OVER THE LOWEST 2000 FEET OR SO. THEREFORE...INITIAL
INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 125 KNOTS. THIS MATCHES WITH THE OBJECTIVE
DVORAK T-NUMBERS WHICH HAVE BEEN OSCILLATING BETWEEN 6.0 AND 6.5. 
SOME FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS POSSIBLE BUT INTENSITY MAY FLUCTUATE
AS THE HURRICANE INTERACTS WITH THE ISLANDS LATER IN THE FORECAST
PERIOD.. 

THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN MOVING 290/17 KNOTS. MOST OF THE MODELS HAVE
A 500MB RIDGE ANCHORED TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE WHICH IS
FORECAST TO PERSIST OR STRENGTHEN.  THIS RIDGE COULD FORCE THE
HURRICANE ON A MORE WESTERLY TRACK AS INDICATED BY LBAR...BAMD AND
THE RELIABLE GFDL. HOWEVER..SINCE NOGPAS AND THE UKMET MODELS ARE
CONSISTENTLY TAKING GEORGE ON A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...AND THE
CURRENT INITIAL MOTION IS 290 DEGREES...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
HAS BEEN ADJUSTED A LITTLE TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACK. THIS MOTION BRINGS THE HURRICANE OVER THE LEEWARD ISLANDS IN
ABOUT 24 HOURS AND NEAR PUERTO RICO WITHIN 48 HOUR OR SO. 
 
A KEY PLAYER COULD BE AN UPPER LOW OVER HISPANIOLA. MODELS WEAKEN
THE LOW RAPIDLY OR MOVE IT SOUTHWESTWARD BUT THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF
EITHER AT THIS TIME. IF THE LOW REMAINS...A MORE NORTHERLY COMPONENT
SHOULD RESULT.

THE PRESSURE WAS DROPPING RAPIDLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THE
AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL
PROBLEMS.  HOWEVER...A NOAA PLANE RECENTLY REPORTED 939 MB SO IT
APPEARS THAT THE RAPID DEEPENING MAY HAVE CEASED FOR NOW.  ANOTHER
AIR FORCE PLANE IS SCHEDULED INTO GEORGES AROUND 0600Z.  CURRENT
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A DISTINCT EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN VERY COLD
CONVECTIVE TOPS.  TAFB...SAB...AND KGWC DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM
0000Z WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT WITH A T6.5...127 KNOTS.  THE MOST
RECENT OBJECTIVE T NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE HIGHER. ONE OF THE GPS
DROPWINDSONDES ACTUALLY REPORTED 166 KNOTS AT LOW LEVELS IN THE
EYEWALL...BUT ONE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE SURFACE WINDS WILL BE
SOMEWHAT LESS.  THE ESTIMATE OF SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS IS NOW 130
KNOTS.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY OCCUR OVER THE NEXT 24
HOURS...BUT GEORGES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN A SOLID CATEGORY FOUR
HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR/SIMPSON HURRICANE SCALE.  THE WEAKENING
INDICATED NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD IS DUE TO INVOLVEMENT
WITH HISPANIOLA.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS STILL SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST...NEAR 16 KNOTS. 
THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY OVER HAITI IS FORECAST TO MOVE
WESTWARD AND NOT BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR.  THE STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE
TO THE NORTH OF GEORGES WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE TRACK.  OUR TRACK
IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS IN BEST
AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL AND LBAR.  THE UKMET AND NAVY NOGAPS ARE TO
THE RIGHT...WHILE THE MID AND DEEP LAYER BAMS AS WELL AS NHC98 ARE
TO THE LEFT.  THE NOAA JET AND THE TWO NOAA P-3 AIRCRAFT ARE FLYING
IN THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND GEORGES TO HELP INITIALIZE THE 0000Z MODEL
RUNS.
 
ONE BIG CHANGE SINCE THE ADDITION OF RECONNAISSANCE DATA HAS BEEN IN
THE SIZE OF THE CIRCULATION.  THE HURRICANE AND TROPICAL STORM FORCE
WIND RADII HAVE BEEN INCREASED CONSIDERABLY BASED ON THE MOST RECENT
ANALYSIS BY THE HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION WHICH INCORPORATES DATA
FROM AIRCRAFT...SATELLITE...AND SHIPS.  BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN
SIZE...MARTINIQUE AND ST LUCIA HAVE ISSUED A TROPICAL STORM WARNING.

A NEW RECON FIX AT 08Z GIVES AN INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE OF 280/15
OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS.  THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL INITIALIZES A TROUGH
BETWEEN BARBADOS AND THE HURRICANE.  THIS RESULTS IN THE AVIATION
MODEL TURNING THE HURRICANE DUE NORTHWARD.  THE INITIALIZATION IS
PROBABLY INCORRECT IN THAT THE NORTH-NORTHEAST 500 MB WIND AT
BARBADOS IS PROBABLY PART OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE HURRICANE RATHER
THAN A SEPARATE TROUGH.
 
THE UKMET AND NOGAPS BOTH SHOW A TRACK NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.
THE GFDL MODEL HAS SHIFTED CONSIDERABLY NORTH OF ITS PREVIOUS RUN
AND NOW SHOWS A 72-HOUR POSITION JUST NORTH OF THE DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS CONSERVATIVELY SHIFTED
ABOUT 100 MILES NORTH AT 72 HOURS AND SMALLER DISTANCES AT THE
SHORTER FORECAST PERIODS...AND IS ABOUT HALF-WAY BETWEEN THE GFDL
MODEL AND THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  
 
THE LATEST CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED FROM AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE
WAS 939 MB AND THE HIGHEST WIND SO FAR WAS 132 KNOTS NEAR THE
SURFACE FROM A GPS DROP IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT AND 146 KNOTS AT
FLIGHT LEVEL IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS
UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY CALLING FOR LITTLE CHANGE
EXCEPT SLIGHT WEAKENING AT 72 HOURS.

11 AM EDT SUN SEP 20 1998

SINCE LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THE MOTION HAS BEEN MOSTLY TOWARD 280
DEGREES...I.E. JUST SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST.  FORWARD SPEED HAS
SLOWED A LITTLE MORE...TO NEAR 14 KNOTS.  THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL SHOW A GRADUAL WEAKENING OF THE 500 MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF
THE CARIBBEAN WITH SOME RETROGRESSION TOWARD THE WEST IN 2 TO 3
DAYS.   WITH THIS EVOLUTION OF THE STEERING FLOW...SOME FURTHER
SLOWING OF FORWARD SPEED APPEARS LIKELY DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
NOT MUCH OF A NORTHWARD TURN IS LIKELY IN THE FIRST PART OF THE
PERIOD...SINCE MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGING SHOULD BE STRONG
OVER THE AREA DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE EXCEPT A BIT SLOWER.  THIS
IS ALSO VERY CLOSE TO THE TRAJECTORY OF THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN. 
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE GFDL TRACK SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY
TO THE NORTH AFTER THE ADDITION OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA FROM A
SYNOPTIC FLOW EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED YESTERDAY EVENING WITH THREE NOAA
AIRCRAFT.  HOWEVER...IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER A MORE NORTHWARD
TREND WILL MATERIALIZE IN THE LONGER-RANGE...BEYOND 3 DAYS...TRACK
OF THIS HURRICANE.

AN ELONGATED UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE/TROUGH THAT WAS IN THE VICINITY OF
HISPANIOLA YESTERDAY HAS SHIFTED WESTWARD AROUND 5 DEGREES.  IT IS
NOT CLEAR WHAT ROLE THIS FEATURE WILL PLAY...BUT IF IT CUTS OFF INTO
A SMALLER-SCALE CYCLONE OVER THE CARIBBEAN THIS COULD LESSEN THE
POSSIBILITY OF A MORE NORTHWARD TRACK FOR GEORGES. 

THE EYE HAS BECOME A LITTLE LESS DISTINCT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS
AND THE DEEP CONVECTION IS NOT QUITE AS SYMMETRICAL AROUND THE
CENTER AS IT WAS EARLIER.  NONETHELESS...THE HURRICANE REMAINS QUITE
FORMIDABLE AND THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS STILL AROUND 130
KNOTS.  ASIDE FROM FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MECHANISMS SUCH AS
EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS
ANTICIPATED UNTIL GEORGES INTERACTS WITH THE LARGER ISLANDS.

ON SATELLITE IMAGES...GEORGES IS NOT AS IMPRESSIVE-LOOKING AS IT WAS
YESTERDAY.  THERE IS NO EYE AND THE COLD CLOUD TOPS ARE NOT VERY
SYMMETRICALLY ARRANGED ABOUT THE CENTER.  RECON SHOWS A HIGHER
CENTRAL PRESSURE THAN EARLY THIS MORNING BUT RECENTLY REPORTED 129
KNOTS AT THE 700 MB FLIGHT LEVEL...AND GEORGES IS STILL A VERY
DANGEROUS HURRICANE.  THERE ARE NO OBVIOUSLY UNFAVORABLE SIGNS IN
THE ENVIRONMENT...SO IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THIS HURRICANE
WILL RESTRENGTHEN DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  SOME WEAKENING COULD
OCCUR IF GEORGES INTERACTS WITH THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF THE
LARGER ISLANDS SUCH AS PUERTO RICO AND HISPANIOLA.

INITIAL MOTION IS ABOUT THE SAME...SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WEST NEAR 14
KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS MOSTLY AN EXTENSION OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE.  ONE OF THE PRIMARY STEERING MECHANISMS IS A MID-TO
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE THAT IS CURRENTLY BETWEEN 20N-30N TO THE
NORTH OF THE HURRICANE.  THIS RIDGE WILL LIKELY BE MAINTAINED DURING
THE FIRST HALF OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...KEEPING GEORGES ON A WEST TO
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD COURSE.   ACCORDING TO THE 12Z NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
RUN...THIS RIDGE IS PREDICTED TO SHIFT WEST-SOUTHWESTWARD LATER IN
THE PERIOD.  AS USUAL THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THE 48-
AND 72-HOURS POSITIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE 500 MB RIDGE OVER THE EXTREME
SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC IS FORECAST TO BE WEAKER IN 2 TO 3
DAYS...THERE MAY BE ENOUGH UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONIC FLOW TO
MAINTAIN THE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION.  ON THE OTHER HAND...3 DAYS
AND BEYOND...THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW SOME AMPLIFICATION OF A DEEP-
LAYER/MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH NEAR AND JUST OFFSHORE OF THE U.S.
EAST COAST WITH WESTERLIES SAGGING THROUGH 30N LATITUDE.  THUS IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT A MORE NORTHWARD COURSE COULD DEVELOP NEAR THE END OF
THE PERIOD...BUT THIS IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE.  IT IS SIMPLY TOO
EARLY TO SPEAK WITH ANY CONFIDENCE ABOUT A THREAT TO THE MAINLAND
U.S. AT THIS TIME.

THE MET OFFICE IN GUADELOUPE HAS FORWARDED THE 01Z OBSERVATION FROM
DESIRADE WHICH REPORTED SUSTAINED WINDS OF 57 KNOTS WITH A GUSTS TO
76 KNOTS.  THE LATEST DATA RECEIVED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE
HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT GEORGES HAS CONTINUED TO
WEAKEN THIS EVENING WITH THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAVING RISEN TO
966 MB. THIS REPRESENTS A 25 MB INCREASE DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS.
THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS DURING THE LAST PASS WAS 114 KNOTS.
SATELLITE IMAGERY CONFIRMS THE WEAKENING TREND WITH THE COLD CLOUD
TOPS REMAINING ASYMMETRIC AND THE STRONGEST CONVECTION IN THE
NORTHWEST QUADRANT OF THE CYCLONE.  BASED ON THIS DATA...THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 100 KNOTS...KEEPING GEORGES A CATEGORY THREE
HURRICANE THAT IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE
IS RESTRICTED.  EXAMINATION OF WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...ALONG WITH
ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE
STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN...SUGGESTS THAT NORTH/
NORTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN IS ONE OF THE POSSIBLE
CULPRITS RESPONSIBLE FOR GEORGES WEAKENING.  SOME OF THE GLOBAL
MODELS SHOW THAT THE SHEAR SHOULD RELAX SOMEWHAT AS THE SYSTEM MOVES
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD WHICH COULD ALLOW FOR SOME RE-INTENSIFICATION. ON
THE OTHER HAND...THE SYSTEM MAY WEAKEN MORE AS IT INTERACTS WITH THE
LARGER ISLANDS...I.E. PUERTO RICO AND HISPANIOLA. THEREFORE...GIVEN
THIS UNCERTAINTY THE FORECAST MAINTAINS GEORGES INTENSITY AT 100
KNOTS THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS UNCHANGED AT 285/14 KNOTS.
THE STEERING OF THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL DEPEND UPON THE STRENGTH
OF THE MID-TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE CURRENTLY LOCATED BETWEEN
20N-30N NORTH. THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY. THE GFDL MODEL IS TO THE LEFT OF OUR TRACK WHILE
THE UKMET IS WELL TO THE RIGHT.  THERE IS STILL CONSIDERABLE
UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING THE THREAT TO THE MAINLAND U.S. AT THIS TIME.

RAPID DEEPENING IS UNLIKELY BEFORE THE EYEWALL REACHES PUERTO RICO.
THERE IS STILL A HINT OF NORTHWESTERLY SHEAR OVER THE AREA...BUT
THIS APPEARS TO BE LESSENING.  LATEST ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN CIMSS SHOW VERTICAL SHEAR MOSTLY LESS THAN 20 KNOTS
ALONG THE PROJECTED PATH OF THE HURRICANE.  OTHERWISE THE ONLY
IMPEDIMENTS TO STRENGTHENING ARE THE LAND MASSES OF THE GREATER
ANTILLES...THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE BEING HISPANIOLA.  

USING RECON FIXES...AND SMOOTHING OUT THE TROCHOIDAL WOBBLES FROM
RADAR...GIVES A CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE OF 285/14 WHICH IS ABOUT THE
SAME AS BEFORE.  THE LATEST GLOBAL MODEL RUNS FROM 12Z SHOW LITTLE
EVIDENCE THAT THE DEEP-LAYER RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF GEORGES WILL GIVE
WAY ENOUGH TO ALLOW A SIGNIFICANT TURN TO THE NORTH DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  TRACK GUIDANCE IS IN SLIGHTLY BETTER AGREEMENT BUT
STILL SHOWS SOME SPREAD...BETWEEN FORECAST POSITIONS NEAR OR JUST
SOUTH OF EASTERN CUBA...AS GIVEN BY DEEP- AND MEDIUM LAYER BAM AND
THE BAROTROPIC TO JUST EAST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS AS GIVEN BY THE

THE ELEVATION OF THE RADAR SITE.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CLOUD
TOPS OF -80C ARE OVER PORTIONS OF EASTERN PUERTO RICO AT THIS TIME.

MOTION HAS SLOWED SLIGHTLY AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IN 270/
13 KNOTS.  A MOTION TOWARD THE WEST OR WEST-NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED 
TO RESUME TUESDAY. RADAR-BASED FIXES PLACE THE CENTER OVER THE
CENTRAL PORTION OF PUERTO RICO IN THE VICINITY OF PONCE.
 
THE DEEP-LAYER RIDGE NORTH OF GEORGES IS FORECAST TO PERSIST SUCH
THAT A SIGNIFICANT NORTHERLY TURN SEEMS UNLIKELY. THE 00Z TRACK
MODEL GUIDANCE IS A BIT MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED BUT CONTINUES TO
SHOW SOME SPREAD...WITH THE UKMET THE EASTERN-MOST TRACK...JUST
EAST OF THE SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS... WHILE THE GFDL IS THE WESTERN-MOST
TRACK WITH A 72 HOUR POSITION JUST OFF THE WESTERN COAST OF CUBA.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE
AND BRINGS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE JUST WEST OF THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS BY
72 HOURS.
 
BASED ON THE NEW TRACK FORECAST THE HURRICANE WATCHES FOR HAITI...
THE TURKS AND CACIOS ISLANDS...AND THE SOUTHERN BAHAMAS ARE BEING
UPGRADED TO HURRICANE WARNINGS.

AIR FORCE RECON AND THE SAN JUAN RADAR SHOW A WELL DEFINED CENTER
OVER WATER JUST WEST OF PUERTO RICO.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
275/12.  THE AVIATION MODEL INITIALIZED THE CENTER ABOUT 270 NMI
NORTHEAST OF THE ACTUAL CENTER.  THIS SENDS THE HURRICANE NORTHWARD.
ALL OF THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE MOVES THE HURRICANE ON A WEST-
NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST TRACK WITH LITTLE OR NO DECREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED ON THE INITIAL MOTION.  THE GFDL...NOGAPS
AND LBAR ALL SHOW THE CENTER JUST SOUTH OF FLORIDA IN THREE DAYS AND
SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  AFTER THREE DAYS  THE NOGAPS TURNS
NORTHWARD INTO A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE LOCATED NORTH OF
THE HURRICANE.  THE GFDL/AVN MODEL SHOWS A NARROW EAST/WEST RIDGE
ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA AT THREE DAYS.  

IN ANY CASE...THE FORECAST TRACK IMPLIES A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. IN THREE TO FOUR DAYS.
 
THE PRESSURE WAS 974 MB WHEN RECON WENT INTO THE CENTER AT 05Z.  AT
0631Z...THE PRESSURE FELL TO 970 MB.  PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME
WEAKENING OVER PUERTO RICO BUT NOT MUCH.  AT 09Z THE WIND IS
ESTIMATED AT 95 KNOTS...THE SAME AS BEFORE LANDFALL.  CONSIDERABLE
WEAKENING IS EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS THE HURRICANE
MOVES OVER HISPANIOLA.  BUT STRENGTHENING IS AGAIN POSSIBLE AFTER
THAT DEPENDING ON HOW CLOSE THE TRACK GOES TO CUBA.

HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY AND RADAR FROM SAN JUAN
SHOW A SPECTACULAR EYE PRESENTATION MOVING ALONG THE SOUTH COAST OF
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC ABOUT 280 DEGREES AT 12 KNOTS. BOTH SATELLITE
AND RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT GEORGES HAS STRENGTHENED
AGAIN AND SATELLITE WIND ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB ARE 115 KNOTS.
RECON JUST FOUND THAT THE PRESSURE HAS DROPPED TO 962 MB AND PEAK
WINDS OF 117 KNOTS. INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 105
KNOTS.  THE HURRICANE IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN OF
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND HAITI TODAY BUT HOW MUCH WEAKENING
DEPENDS HOW LONG THE HURRICANE STAYS OVER LAND. THE HURRICANE IS
FORECAST TO REGAIN MUCH OF ITS STRENGTH DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS
IT MOVES OVER WATER.

SINCE THE HURRICANE HAS DECREASED ITS FORWARD MOTION...THERE IS MORE
TIME FOR THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE TO EVOLVE. IF THE
RIDGE WEAKENS...THE HURRICANE COULD BEGIN A NORTHWESTERLY TRACK
SOONER THAN ANTICIPATED. AT THIS TIME MOST...OF THE MODELS ARE
BRINGING THE HURRICANE VERY CLOSE TO THE SOUTHEAST FLORIDA COAST BY
72 HOURS AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. THE LAST PORTION OF THE
FORECAST IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE A SLIGHT STRENGTHENING OF THE
RIDGE COULD FORCE THE HURRICANE OVER FLORIDA AND A SLIGHT WEAKENING
MAY KEEP THE HURRICANE OFFSHORE.  IN ANY CASE...WE SHOULD MONITOR
THE HURRICANE VERY CLOSELY.

THE EYE HAS SURPRISINGLY MAINTAINED ITS IDENTITY IN SPITE OF MOVING
OVER LAND DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS AND IT WAS CLEARLY SEEN ON VIS AND
IR SATELLITE IMAGES UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN IT HAS BEGUN TO FILL.  THE
HURRICANE HAS EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND BANDING FEATURES. GEORGES IS
EXPECTED TO WEAKEN OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
AND HAITI TODAY BUT HOW MUCH WEAKENING DEPENDS HOW LONG THE
HURRICANE STAYS OVER LAND. THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO REGAIN MUCH
OF ITS STRENGTH DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS IT MOVES OVER WATER.
 
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/12 AND SOME DEVIATION OF
THIS GENERAL TRACK IS EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO AS THE
HURRICANE INTERACTS WITH THE VERY HIGH MOUNTAINS OF HISPANIOLA.
THEREAFTER... ONCE OVER WATER AGAIN...THE MOTION OF THE HURRICANE
WILL BE CONTROLLED BY A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM TO THE NORTH...WHICH IN
FACT...MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS MAINTAIN THROUGH 72 HOURS.  TRACK
GUIDANCE IS IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT AND BASICALLY ALL OF THE MODELS
BRING GEORGES WITHIN A BELT BETWEEN HAVANA AND LAKE OKEECHOBEE BY 60
HOURS OR SO.   

THE LAST PORTION OF THE FORECAST IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE A
SLIGHT STRENGTHENING OF THE RIDGE COULD FORCE THE HURRICANE OVER
SOUTH FLORIDA AND INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO AND A SLIGHT WEAKENING
OF THE RIDGE MAY KEEP THE HURRICANE OFFSHORE.  IN ANY CASE...
INTERESTS IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES SHOULD MONITOR THE
HURRICANE VERY CLOSELY.  THE TIME FOR ISSUING A HURRICANE WATCH FOR
A PORTION OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS IS APPROACHING.

HURRICANE GEORGES DISCUSSION NUMBER  31
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT TUE SEP 22 1998
 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE THIS EVENING IS...WHERE IS THE CENTER?
THE MOUNTAINS OF HISPANIOLA...PEAKS TO NEAR 10000 FEET...HAVE
DISRUPTED GEORGES.  THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PICK OUT THE
CENTER...ESPECIALLY ON INFRARED IMAGERY.  AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO FIX THE CENTER UNTIL IT EMERGES BACK OVER THE WATER
WEDNESDAY MORNING.  THE CURRENT POSITION ESTIMATE IS BASED ON
SATELLITE AND SCANTY SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...SOME OF THESE FROM
UNOFFICIAL OBSERVING SITES RELAYED BY HAM RADIO.  WITH LARGE
UNCERTAINTIES IN CURRENT POSITION AND MOTION...IT IS BEST NOT TO
MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  MOTION ESTIMATE IS
290/12 AND THE BEST GUESS IS THAT THE CENTER IS NEARING THE BORDER
OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND HAITI.  IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER
THE CENTER WILL EMERGE ON THE WEST OR THE NORTH COAST OF HAITI.
 
TRACK GUIDANCE IS SIMILAR TO BEFORE.  DROPWINDSONDE DATA FROM THE
NOAA AIRCRAFT SHOWED A FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE NEAR AND JUST EAST OF THE BAHAMAS.  THIS SUPPORTS A
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TRACK DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  LATER IN THE PERIOD...THE TRACK DEPENDS ON HOW THIS
ANTICYCLONE ...AND THE MID/UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE NEAR WESTERN
CUBA...EVOLVE WITH TIME.  THE GENERAL CONSENSUS FROM THE NUMERICAL
MODELS IS THAT THE UPPER CYCLONE WILL MOVE WESTWARD IN ADVANCE OF
GEORGES AND THAT THE RIDGE WILL BE BARELY MAINTAINED FOR THE NEXT
2-3 DAYS.  IF THE UPPER CYCLONE MOVES SIGNIFICANTLY WESTWARD...AND
THE ANTICYCLONE STAYS PUT...A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION
WOULD LIKELY RESULT.  IF THE RIDGE SHIFTS A LITTLE EASTWARD AND THE
UPPER CYCLONE DOES NOT MOVE MUCH...THEN A MORE NORTHWARD TRACK IS
POSSIBLE.  THE LATEST OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN EXTENSION OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE.  THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL AND THE THREE
BAM TRACKS...WHICH ARE ALL VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.
 
ONE SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON OUR PRECISE FORECAST TRACK...ESPECIALLY AT
48 AND 72 HOURS...SINCE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS MAY STILL OCCUR.
 
AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE HAS BEEN FLYING AROUND THE COAST
OF HISPANIOLA AND THEY FOUND THAT A VIGOROUS LOW- TO MID-LEVEL
CIRCULATION STILL EXISTS.  THE INNER CORE...HOWEVER...HAS LIKELY
BEEN SEVERELY DISRUPTED SO THE MAXIMUM WINDS ON THIS ADVISORY ARE
REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLY...TO 70 KNOTS.  GEORGES HAS A VERY IMPRESSIVE
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW SIGNATURE AND WOULD CERTAINLY BE A VERY INTENSE
HURRICANE AT THIS TIME...WERE IT NOT LOCATED OVER LAND.  WHEN THE
CENTER MOVES BACK OVER WATER...RE-INTENSIFICATION SEEMS CERTAIN...
PARTICULARLY WHEN GEORGES MOVES OVER THE WARM WATERS OF THE STRAITS
OF FLORIDA.

THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A CENTER TO TRACK ON INFRARED IMAGERY.  THE
INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 285/13...NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN 6
HOURS AGO.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT A
NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS...EXCEPT LBAR AND THE AVIATION
MODEL WHICH TURN GEORGES NORTHWARD AFTER 48 HOURS...APPARENTLY
FINDING A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH THAT THE OTHER MODELS
DO NOT SEE.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF GFDL MODEL...PUTTING THE
CENTER JUST OFF THE LOWER FLORIDA WEST COAST IN 72 HOURS AND IN THE
FLORIDA KEYS IN 48 HOURS.  THE UKMET MODEL IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE
GFDL AND THE NOGAPS IS CONSIDERABLY LEFT...TO NEAR HAVANA IN 72
HOURS.
 
THE WIND SPEED IS ASSUMED TO HAVE DECREASED TO 65 KNOTS WHILE THE
HURRICANE IS OVER LAND.  THE FORECAST INTENSITY ASSUMES THE CENTER
WILL BE OVER WATER AND THAT THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT
INTENSIFICATION...EVEN THOUGH THE FORECAST TRACK IS ON THE NORTH
COAST OF CUBA FOR 24 HOURS.
 
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN THIS FORECAST PACKAGE...SINCE
THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN OVER LAND FOR A WHILE.  THE CENTER IS NOT
WELL DEFINED ON SATELLITE...THERE HAVE BEEN FEW SURFACE OBSERVATIONS
AND THE RECON AIRCRAFT COULD NOT FLY INTO THE HURRICANE OVER LAND.
I AM NOT PLEASED TO PUT UP A HURRICANE WATCH FOR SOUTH FLORIDA WITH
SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY...BUT AM DOING SO AS A STRATEGY OF LEAST REGRET.

HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL THAT GEORGES HAS
MAINTAINED A WELL DEFINED CLOUD PATTERN IN SPITE OF THE HURRICANE
HAVING MOVED OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN OF HISPANIOLA FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS
OR MORE. THERE IS A BROAD CIRCULATION CENTER THAT RESEMBLES AN EYE
WITH PLENTY OF BANDING FEATURES AND DEEP CONVECTION. THE
HURRICANE LACKS OF AN INNER CORE AT THIS TIME.  THE ATMOSPHERE
APPEARS TO BE CONDUCIVE FOR RESTRENGTHENING AND LAND IS THE ONLY
IMPEDIMENT.

BEST ESTIMATES OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/13. HOWEVER...THIS IS
VERY UNCERTAIN SINCE THE HURRICANE JUST MOVED OFF HAITI AND IS
REFORMING. THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO MOVE ON A GENERAL WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK AROUND THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AND THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE MODELS. ON THIS TRACK GEORGES WILL BE
MOVING ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA AND THEREAFTER THROUGH THE
FLORIDA STRAITS OR SOUTH FLORIDA BETWEEN 36 AND 48 HOURS. 

THE NEXT 24 HOURS WILL BE CRITICAL ...THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT
THE HURRICANE WILL MOVE ALONG THE SOUTH COAST OF EASTERN CUBA OR
OVER CUBAN MOUNTAINS. THAT WOULD DELAY THE STRENGTHENING BUT THE
TRACK BEYOND 36 HOURS WOULD NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE

IT CONTINUES TO BE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER USING SATELLITE
IMAGES...BUT OUR BEST GUESS IS THAT IT IS STILL INLAND OVER EASTERN
CUBA.  RECENT OBSERVATIONS FROM GUANTANAMO NAVY BASE ARE CONSISTENT
WITH OUR ESTIMATED POSITION.  THE NOAA PLANE CANNOT LOCATE THE
CENTER WHILE IT IS OVER LAND.  HOWEVER...WE ARE ALERT TO THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE CENTER MAY EMERGE ON THE NORTH COAST AT ANY
TIME...AND IF IT DOES...THE AIRCRAFT SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCATE IT. 
THE CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS A LITTLE SLOWER...295/10.  THE
PRIMARY STEERING MECHANISMS ARE A MID-TO UPPER-LEVEL HIGH TO THE
NORTH OF GEORGES AND A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW NEAR THE NORTHEAST
TIP OF YUCATAN.  THESE FEATURES SHOULD MAINTAIN WEST-NORTHWEST TO
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK FOR THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  OVERALL...THE TRACK
GUIDANCE HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY...AND THE CURRENT NHC
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO ITS PREDECESSOR.  IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO
FOCUS ON THIS PRECISE TRACK BECAUSE HISTORICALLY ERRORS OF 100 TO
150 MILES ARE POSSIBLE IN THE 24 AND 36 HOURS POSITIONS.
 
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD A THREAT TO THE NORTHEASTERN
GULF IS IMPLIED.  INTERESTS THERE SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
GEORGES.
 
ON THE LARGER-SCALE...GEORGES LOOKS IMPRESSIVE WITH HEALTHY
CONVECTIVE BANDING FEATURES AND A PICTURESQUE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC
OUTFLOW PATTERN.  HOWEVER...THE INNER-CORE FEATURES REMAIN
DIFFUSE... LIKELY BECAUSE OF THE INTERACTION WITH LAND.  ASIDE FROM
THE INFLUENCE OF LAND...METEOROLOGICAL AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS FAVOR
STRENGTHENING.  GEORGES IS PREDICTED TO RE-INTENSIFY TO CATEGORY 2
STATUS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...BUT IT COULD DO SO SOONER...AND GEORGES
COULD GET STRONGER THAN WE HAVE SHOWN HERE.  WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT

THE HURRICANE IS STILL CENTERED OVER EASTERN CUBA AND ESTIMATING THE
LOCATION AND INITIAL MOTION IS DIFFICULT.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 300/10 BASED ON LIMITED SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...AND A
POORLY DEFINED CENTER ON INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY AND ON NOAA
AIRCRAFT RADAR AND ON A CUBAN RADAR.
 
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE...
THE HIGH TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE AND THE LOW NEAR THE YUCATAN
CHANNEL CONTINUE TO BE THE CONTROLLING FACTORS AND ARE NOT FORECAST
TO CHANGE RADICALLY DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE GFDL...UKMET
AND NOGAPS MODELS ARE IN CLOSE AGREEMENT SHOWING THE CENTER MOVING
NORTHWESTWARD TO NEAR KEY WEST IN 24 TO 36 HOURS AND CONTINUING TO
THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO IN 72 HOURS.  COMPARED TO THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST CYCLE...THE UKMET CHANGED LITTLE...THE NOGAPS
MOVED TO THE RIGHT AND THE GFDL MOVED SLIGHTLY LEFT.  THE LBAR IS
SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE THREE MODELS JUST MENTIONED.  THE
AVIATION MODEL TURNS GEORGES NORTHWARD ACROSS EASTERN FLORIDA AND
THE ETA AND NGM SHOW THIS ALSO.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
SHIFTED JUST SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BUT NOT
AS FAR AS THE GFDL...NOGAPS AND UKMET WOULD SUGGEST.
 
A NOAA AIRCRAFT WIND REPORT OF 74 KNOTS AT FLIGHT LEVEL TO THE EAST
OF THE CENTER OVER WATER ALLOWS FOR GEORGES TO BE KEPT AS A MINIMAL
HURRICANE WITH 65 KNOT SUSTAINED WINDS.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS
THAT THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN HAS HELD TOGETHER VERY WELL EVEN
THOUGH THE INNER CORE STRUCTURE APPEARS DISORGANIZED.  WITH A
FORECAST OF NOT TOO MUCH VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ALONG THE FORECAST
TRACK COMBINED WITH WARM GULF WATERS...THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF
SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.  THUS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS FOR
INTENSIFICATION AS THE CENTER IS FORECAST TO MOVE OVER WATER BY 24
HOURS.  IT SHOULD BE REALIZED THAT OUR SKILL IN FORECASTING
INTENSITY IS QUITE LIMITED COMPARED TO OUR TRACK FORECASTING SKILL.
 
HAVING SAID ALL THAT...IT IS PRUDENT TO ISSUE A HURRICANE WARNING
FOR EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS.  I WOULD LOVE TO WAIT LONGER
BEFORE ISSUING WARNINGS TO MINIMIZE SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY
INVOLVED.  A HURRICANE WARNING FOR A MINIMAL CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE
THAT MIGHT STRENGTHEN IS NOT THE SAME KIND OF SITUATION AS HAVING A

...COR TO 72 HOUR POSITION

NOAA RECONNAISSANCE PLANE HAS BEEN OBSERVING GEORGES DURING THE PAST
FEW HOURS AND THE MINIMUM PRESSURE HAS BEEN OSCILLATING AROUND 989
AND 991 MB. THE PLANE ALSO REPORTED THAT AN EYEWALL IS FORMING.
BASED ON REPORTS FROM THE PLANE AND OBSERVATIONS FROM CUBA...THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS ADJUSTED TO 70 KNOTS. SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE
TO SHOW AN IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW AND BANDING FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH
GEORGES. MOST OF THE MODELS MAINTAIN AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE WITH
LOW SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS AND OTHER CONDITIONS 
ARE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING.  THIS PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN
AS SOON AS THE CENTER MOVES OVER WATER LATER TODAY. THERE IS A HIGH
LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST SO A STRONGER THAN
FORECAST HURRICANE IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 305/10. THERE IS A GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONG THE
MODELS THAT THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT 3
DAYS.  ON THIS TRACK THE CENTER OF GEORGES SHOULD MOVE OFF CUBA
TODAY AND CROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS BETWEEN 24 AND 36 HOURS AND THEN
INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. RESIDENTS ALONG THE GULF COAST
SHOULD BEGIN TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE PROGRESS OF GEORGES.

..COR TO ADV NUMBER

DEEP CONVECTION IS MORE SYMMETRIC AND THE OVERALL PATTERN CONTINUES
TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED.  HOWEVER...THE EYEWALL REMAINS POORLY
DEFINED ON ITS NORTHWEST PORTION.  NOAA RECONNAISSANCE PLANE
MEASURED WINDS OF 85 KNOTS AT FLIGHT LEVEL TO THE EAST OF THE CENTER
AND 985 MB MINIMUM PRESSURE.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS ADJUSTED TO 85
KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  MOST OF THE MODELS MAINTAIN LOW SHEAR OVER THE
HURRICANE SO A CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED. GEORGES IS
FORECAST TO REACH CATEGORY 3 STATUS BY 36 HOURS OR SO.  
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 305/12.  THE STEERING FLOW IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN 
UNCHANGED...SO THE HURRICANE SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE SAME GENERAL
TRACK AS INDICATED BY MOST OF THE MODELS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
BASICALLY AN UPDATE FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK BRINGING THE
CORE OF THE HURRICANE OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 HOURS
AND THEN INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. 

ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE GULF COAST FROM LOUISIANA EASTWARD SHOULD
CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS LARGE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
HURRICANE.

THE EYE IS BECOMING BETTER-DEFINED AS IT APPROACHES THE STRAITS OF
FLORIDA.  LATEST RECON REPORTS SHOWED A CLOSED WALL.  THE UPPER-
LEVEL OUTFLOW REMAINS IMPRESSIVE...AND SUBSTANTIAL STRENGTHENING
COULD OCCUR DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST...WHICH SHOWS GEORGES EVENTUALLY RE-ATTAINING
CATEGORY 3 STATUS.  IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...THE
ONLY FACTORS THAT MIGHT LIMIT INTENSIFICATION ARE A LITTLE MORE
STABLE ATMOSPHERE AND PERHAPS SOME INCREASED SHEAR OVER THE NORTHERN
GULF OF MEXICO.
 
NO BIG CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE TRACK FORECAST SINCE THE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE IS ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE...AND MY SYNOPTIC REASONING IS
THE SAME AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AS WELL.  THE HURRICANE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO BE STEERED ON A COURSE FROM WEST-NORTHWEST TO
NORTHWEST...BETWEEN A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF
GEORGES AND A MID- TO UPPER LEVEL LOW TO THE WEST-SOUTHWEST...OVER
THE SOUTH-CENTRAL GULF.  GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A GRADUAL TRANSITION AT
500 MB DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS...FROM A MOSTLY ZONAL FLOW PATTERN
TO A HIGHER AMPLITUDE ONE OVER THE U.S. AND THIS COULD ALLOW A MORE
NORTHWARD MOTION NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY EAST OF THE LATEST GFDL RUN AT 72 HOURS...AND
ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE IN THE 2- TO 3-DAY TIME FRAME.
AS ALWAYS...THE 3-DAY FORECAST POSITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE
UNCERTAINTY.  ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE GULF COAST FROM LOUISIANA
EASTWARD SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS LARGE AND
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HURRICANE.
 
RECON DATA AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT THE 50-KNOT WIND
RADIUS NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED TO THE NORTHEAST...TO 125 N MI.  THIS
MEANS THAT A LARGE PART OF SOUTH FLORIDA SHOULD EXPERIENCE
POTENTIALLY DAMAGING WINDS FOR THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT FRI SEP 25 1998
 
THE STRUCTURE AND INTENSITY OF GEORGES HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH DURING
THE PAST FEW HOURS.  AN OPEN EYEWALL IS EVIDENT ON RADAR AND TO THE
HURRICANE HUNTERS.  HEAVIEST CONVECTION...WITH THE STRONGEST
WINDS...RAIN AND SURGE ARE ON THE EAST SIDE AND ARE SPREADING OVER
THE FLORIDA KEYS.  SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW A FAINT EYE AT THIS
TIME.  THE HURRICANE HUNTERS MEASURED FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 105
KT...WHILE SPOT WINDS MEASURED IN THE EYEWALL BY A DROPSONDE WERE AS
HIGH AS 109 KT ALOFT AND 85 KT AT THE SURFACE.  THE ESTIMATED
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED SURFACE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 90 KT BASED ON
THESE DATA.
 
THE LARGE-SCALE HIGH OVER TEXAS IS FORECAST BY THE 06Z AVN AND 00Z
NOGAPS TO SHIFT EASTWARD TO THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST DURING THE NEXT
TWO DAYS.  THIS PUTS GEORGES ON THE SW SIDE OF THAT FEATURE...IN A
STEERING CURRENT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A CONTINUED NW MOTION AS
SHOWN BY THE MODEL AND OFFICIAL TRACKS.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS
ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED WITH JUST A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO THE LEFT.
THIS IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL AND NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE OTHER MODEL
TRACKS.
 
THIS POSES AN INCREASING THREAT FROM LOUISIANA EASTWARD TO THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE.  A HURRICANE WATCH IS NOW ISSUED FOR PART OF THAT
AREA.
 
CIRRUS ELEMENTS ARE NO LONGER EXPANDING OUTWARD TO THE NORTHWEST SO
THE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT MIGHT NOT BE QUITE AS CONDUCIVE TO
FURTHER  STRENGTHENING AS EARLIER.  THE SHIPS AND GFDL INTENSITY
SCHEMES SHOW A LITTLE INCREASE IN THE WIND...NOT QUITE AS MUCH AS
SHOWN IN THE CURRENT AND PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECASTS.

WHILE RADAR DATA FROM KEY WEST IS CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE...THE 
EYE IS BECOMING MORE DISTINCT ON SATELLITE PICTURES AND THE CENTRAL
PRESSURE HAS FALLEN A LITTLE OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. RECENTLY...DRY
TORTUGAS HAD 976.3 MB WITH 18 KT WINDS...SO THE CENTRAL PRESSURE IS
ANALYZED AS 975 MB.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 90 KT.  THE
HEADING HAS BEEN 300/12 KT FOR A FEW HOURS...BUT A RETURN TO A NW
MOTION SHOULD RESUME SHORTLY.
 
THE 12Z NOGAPS FORECAST FOR THE LARGE-SCALE EVOLUTION RESEMBLES
PREVIOUS RUNS WITH A DEVELOPING ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN
STATES DRIVING GEORGES TOWARD THE NORTHERN GULF COAST.  LONG-RANGE
FORECASTERS AT THE NWS HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL PREDICTION CENTER HAVE
INDICATED A POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT SLOWING NEAR THE END OF THE
PERIOD.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OUTPUT FROM THE UKMET AND NOGAPS
RUNS AND BAM...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST NOW SHOWS A LITTLE SLOWER
MOVEMENT NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD.

WITH RADAR DATA CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FROM KEY WEST AND GEORGES SOON
TO MOVE OUT OF RANGE OF THE MIAMI RADAR...THE NHC WILL RETURN TO 3-
HOURLY INTERMEDIATE ADVISORIES AND DISCONTINUE HOURLY POSITION
ESTIMATES.

A HURRICANE WARNING COULD BE REQUIRED LATER THIS EVENING OR EARLY IN
THE MORNING FOR A PORTION OF THE NORTHERN GULF COAST.

RADAR AND AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT FIXES DURING
THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS INDICATE THAT THE CENTER OF GEORGES HAS
BEEN WOBBLING WESTWARD.  HOWEVER...THE MOST RECENT RADAR POSITION
ESTIMATE SUGGESTS THAT THE SYSTEM MAY BE RESUMING A MORE WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD HEADING.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/07 KNOTS.

RECON DATA INDICATES THAT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OVERALL CHANGE IN 
GEORGES INTENSITY THE PAST SIX HOURS OR SO.  THE LATEST AIRCRAFT
VORTEX MESSAGE SHOWED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 973 MB AND MAXIMUM
FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 94 KNOTS.  THE DRY TORTUGAS C-MAN BUOY
REPORTED SOUTHERLY WINDS OF 50 KNOTS AND A PRESSURE OF 989.9 MB
AT 01Z.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 90 KNOTS.  SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE DEEPEST CONVECTION IS OCCURRING ON THE
EASTERN SIDE OF THE SYSTEM.  THE OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED OVER THE
NORTHWEST QUADRANT BUT REMAINS IMPRESSIVE ELSEWHERE.  ANALYSES 
FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SHOW SOME 20-30 KT VERTICAL WIND
SHEAR OVER THE NORTHEAST/CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.  ALTHOUGH THE 
RIDGE ASSOCIATED WITH GEORGES SHOULD LESSEN THE SHEAR AS IT BUILDS
NORTHWARD IT STILL MAY HAMPER FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THE FORECAST
CONTINUES THE TREND OF GRADUAL INTENSIFICATION BRINGING GEORGES TO
CATEGORY THREE STATUS BY 36 HOURS.      

THE MODEL TRACK GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO SHOW CONSIDERABLE SCATTER WITH
LBAR...UKMET AND NOGAPS SHOWING A 72 HOUR POSITION SOUTH OF THE
LOUISIANA COAST WHILE THE GFDL...AVN AND A98E ARE INLAND BETWEEN
ALABAMA AND THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE BY 48 HOURS. THE GFDL AND AVN
INDICATE THAT GEORGES ROTATES AROUND THE 500 MB ANTICYCLONE TO 
THE EAST.  THE EVOLVING SYNOPTIC PATTERN INDICATES THAT THE FORWARD
MOTION MAY SLOW. 

THE NOAA G-IV JET IS PERFORMING A SYNOPTIC FLOW MISSION OVER THE
GULF OF MEXICO THIS EVENING WITH THE DATA TO BE USED TO INITIALIZE
THE 00Z GLOBAL MODELS.

THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE WIND OR PRESSURE PATTERN
ASSOCIATED WITH GEORGES. MINIMUM PRESSURE REMAINS NEAR 974 MB AND
PEAK WINDS ARE ABOUT 90 KNOTS. THE INNER CORE HAS NOT REFORMED
COMPLETELY YET SINCE IT WAS DISRUPTED BY LAND.  HOWEVER...IT USUALLY
TAKES TIME FOR THE BOUNDARY LAYER TO RECOVER FROM THE INTERACTION
WITH LAND.  ONE SHOULD MENTION THAT THE INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL
...SHIPS...DOES NOT STRENGTHEN THE HURRICANE AND THE GFDL IS NOT
SHOWING THE EXPLOSIVE INTENSIFICATION WHICH IT NORMALLY FORECASTS. 
THIS SUGGESTS THERE MAY BE SOME FACTORS INHIBITING THE
STRENGTHENING.  BECAUSE MOST OF THE MODELS MAINTAIN LOW SHEAR OVER
THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE WATER IS WARM...A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING
IS INDICATED.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 295/08.  THERE IS A STRONG 500 MB RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF THE HURRICANE WHICH IS FORECAST TO MOVE EASTWARD. THIS
WOULD ALLOW THE HURRICANE TO MOVE ON A NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.
HOWEVER...MODELS...MAINLY THE UKMET AND NOGAPS ARE FORECASTING A
TRACK MORE TO THE WEST AND BOTH KEEP THE HURRICANE MOVING ALONG THE
LOUISIANA AND EASTERN TEXAS COASTS. THE GFDL SLOWS DOWN THE
HURRICANE CONSIDERABLY BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE BUT A SMALL
WESTWARD SHIFT MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY IF THE MODELS CONTINUE TO
SHOW A WESTWARD TREND AND A RIDGE BUILDING TO THE NORTH.

DATA FROM A NOAA BUOY AND AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE SHOW A RATHER
ASYMMETRIC WIND FIELD AT THIS TIME WITH HURRICANE FORCE WINDS
CONFINED TO THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE AND A MUCH LONGER EXTENT OF
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS IN THAT DIRECTION.  LIGHT WESTERLY SHEAR
IS ANALYZED AND THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE AGAIN ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 90
KT.
 
WHILE THE TRACK HAS EDGED TOWARD THE LEFT OVER THE PAST FEW
FORECASTS...THE FINAL CENTER FIX FROM THE HURRICANE HUNTERS FOR THIS
ADVISORY SUGGESTS THAT THE HEADING HAS EASED BACK TO 300 DEGREES AT
10 KT.  THE LARGE SCALE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW AN ANTICYCLONE
SHIFTING TO THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES AND A TROUGH SWINGING EASTWARD
ACROSS THE NORTH CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN STATES.  THIS TROUGH
PASSES BY TO THE NORTH OF GEORGES AND THE TRAILING DEVELOPING RIDGE
COULD SLOW OR BLOCK THE NORTHWARD PROGRESS NEAR THE END OF THE
PERIOD AS GEORGES APPROACHES LAND.  THE TRACK MODELS GENERALLY SHOW
THIS SLOWING...BUT THEIR SOLUTIONS BEGIN TO DIVERGE AFTER 48 HOURS. 
THE PRIMARY THREAT REMAINS FOR THE AREA FROM THE WESTERN FLORIDA
PANHANDLE TO LOUISIANA AND A HURRICANE WARNING IS NOW ISSUED FROM
MORGAN CITY TO PANAMA CITY.
 
GIVEN THE FORECAST TRACK AND INTENSITY...GEORGES IS LIKELY TO POSE A
SIGNIFICANT FLOOD DANGER DUE TO BOTH STORM SURGE AND RAINFALL.

FOR THE VULNERABLE AREAS IN THE WARNED ZONE...PARTICULARLY AROUND
NEW ORLEANS AND ELSEWHERE IN SOUTHEASTERN LOUISIANA...GEORGES IS
POSING AN INCREASING AND UNUSUALLY SEVERE FLOOD THREAT FROM A
COMBINATION OF STORM SURGE AND RAINFALL.

THE FORECAST GUIDANCE HAS CHANGED LITTLE.  MODEL OUTPUT CONTINUES TO
SHOW GEORGES SLOWING DOWN AS IT NEARS THE COAST IN THE WARNING AREA.
THE GFDL RUN FROM 12Z IS NOW AVAILABLE AND IT IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO
OUR PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST.  OTHER GUIDANCE HAS CONVERGED
SOMEWHAT ALONG THAT TRACK AS WELL..SO NO IMPORTANT CHANGES HAVE BEEN
MADE TO THE NHC TRACK.  A SIGNIFICANT SLOW DOWN IS AGAIN EXPECTED AS
GEORGES TEMPORARILY BECOMES TRAPPED IN THE WEAK STEERING FLOW REGIME
BETWEEN THE HIGH TO BE CENTERED TO THE SE OVER FLORIDA...AND ANOTHER
HIGH DEVELOPING TO THE NW OF GEORGES IN THE WAKE OF THE SHORT-WAVE
TROUGH MOVING OFFSHORE FROM THE EAST COAST.
 
THE EYE HAS GRADUALLY BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED ON SATELLITE PICTURES
WITH DVORAK T-NUMBERS NOW HAVING REACHED 5.5...OR 102 KT.  THE
HURRICANE HUNTERS RECENTLY FOUND A 968 MB PRESSURE AND 92 KT AT
FLIGHT LEVEL...BUT AN EYEWALL DROPSONDE SHOWED 95 KT AT THE SURFACE. 
THE MOST RECENT HRD ANALYSIS SHOWS AROUND 70 KT.  THESE DATA SHOW
THE UNCERTAINTY INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THE MAXIMUM WIND SPEED.  THE

ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.

THE LATEST RECON FIX GIVES A MOTION OF 310/09 FOR THE PAST 12
HOURS...COMPARED TO 305/09 ON THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. THE PAST 6 HOUR
MOTION IS 315/09.
 
THE GUIDANCE HAS CHANGED LITTLE...AGAIN.   ALL OF THE MODELS SHOW A
SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TO THE
EAST...NORTH...AND WEST OF THE HURRICANE.  THE 12Z UKMET AND NOGAPS
MODELS SHOW A 72 HOUR POSITION JUST OFFSHORE OF THE CENTRAL
LOUISIANA COAST.  THE LBAR 72 HOUR POSITION IS IN CENTRAL LOUISIANA
AND THE GFDL 72 HOUR POSITION IS IN CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI.  THE GFDL
MODEL...BASED ON THE 18Z AVIATION RUN IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN ITS
PREVIOUS RUN.  THE AVIATION MODEL IS IN SOUTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND IS
SOMEWHAT LEFT OF ITS PREVIOUS RUN.
 
IN SUMMARY...THE GUIDANCE SHOWS THE CORE OF THE HURRICANE REACHING
NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IN ABOUT 24 HOURS AND
SLOWING DOWN.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE GFDL MODEL...EXCEPT
IS A LITTLE SLOWER AFTER 48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALSO
VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST...SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE
RIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT INITIAL MOTION.
 
THE LATEST RECON FIX HAD A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 968 MB...NO CHANGE
FROM EARLIER.  THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED AN ELLIPTICAL SHAPED EYE AT
2325Z AND THEN NO EYE AT 0113Z.  HOWEVER SATELLITE SHOWS AN EYE
FEATURE FORMING AND KEVX EGLIN RADAR SHOWS EVIDENCE OF AN EYE
AT ABOUT 200 MILES RANGE.  THE LATEST HRD SURFACE ANALYSIS HAS THE
WIND SPEED UP 5 KNOTS TO 75 KNOTS.  THE MAXIMUM AIRCRAFT WIND SPEED
WAS 86 KNOTS IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT WHICH IS A LITTLE LESS THAT
THE PREVIOUS RECON MISSION.  THE OFFICIAL WIND SPEED AND FORECAST IS
KEPT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...EXCEPT FOR BRINGING THE
WINDS DOWN SOME MORE AT 48 AND 72 HOURS AS THE CENTER IS FORECAST A
LITTLE FURTHER INLAND.
 
THE FORECAST SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE HURRICANE PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR EXTREMELY LARGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS COMBINED WITH A LONG PERIOD OF
ONSHORE WINDS AND STORM SURGE FLOODING.  THE GFDL MODEL PROJECTS
SOME 32 INCHES OF RAIN ALONG THE PATH OF THE HURRICANE.

SHEAR IS LOW BUT...AT THIS STAGE...THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ENOUGH
FOR THE HURRICANE TO INTENSIFY RAPIDLY.  IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN
MOST OF THE HURRICANE INTENSITY CHANGE WORKSHOPS...THAT...FOR RAPID
INTENSIFICATION...THERE SHOULD BE AN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLE
AND/OR A TROUGH INTERACTION.  THESE TWO PROCESSES ARE VERY DIFFICULT
TO EVALUATE...BUT WITH THE LIMITED AVAILABLE INFORMATION...NONE OF
THE ABOVE PROCESSES ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR BECAUSE THE INGREDIENTS ARE
NOT PRESENT.  THERE IS NOT A PERSISTENT AND WELL DEFINED INNER
CORE...NO DOUBLE EYE STRUCTURE EITHER AND THERE IS NO UPPER-TROUGH
APPROACHING THE HURRICANE.  ONLY A SMALL INCREASE IN INTENSITY IS
THEN FORECAST BEFORE LANDFALL.  THIS IS AN ARRESTED FORECAST BECAUSE
THE ABOVE PROCESSES ARE STILL IN THEORY AND HAVE NOT BEEN TRANSLATED
INTO OPERATIONAL TOOLS YET.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 310/09.  THE STEERING PATTERN IS EVOLVING AS
FORECAST.  THEREFORE...NO CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK IS NECESSARY.   MODELS CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT THE STEERING
CURRENTS WILL COLLAPSE AS THE HURRICANE MAKES LANDFALL.  THIS MEANS
THAT THE HURRICANE WOULD SLOW DOWN CONSIDERABLY AND COULD PRODUCE
EXTREMELY LARGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS COMBINED WITH A LONG PERIOD OF
ONSHORE WINDS AND STORM SURGE FLOODING.  GEORGES IS A VERY SERIOUS
THREAT AND IT COULD BE EVEN WORSE IF THE HURRICANE STRENGTHENS MORE
THAN
FORECAST.

A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 963 MB FROM A GPS DROPSONDE WITH
MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 86 KNOTS.  BUOY 42040 REPORTED A 
45 KT 8-MINUTE SUSTAINED WIND...APPROXIMATELY 55 KT 1-MINUTE WIND
SPEED...AND 33 FOOT SEAS AT 12Z WHILE THE C-MAN BUOY NEAR THE MOUTH
OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WAS 39 KT. THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE
HELD AT 95 KNOTS.  THIS KEEPS GEORGES ON THE HIGH END OF CATEGORY
TWO STATUS.  THE FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR GEORGES TO STRENGTHEN 
TO A CATEGORY THREE BEFORE LANDFALL. 

BASED ON THE WIND DATA ABOVE...RECON WIND PLOTS AND HURRICANE
RESEARCH DIVISION...HRD...ANALYSES THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN
ADJUSTED.  THE PRIMARY CHANGE IS THE ADDITION OF HURRICANE-FORCE
WINDS IN THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  

FIXES FROM RECON AND NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR SUGGEST
A SLIGHT SLOWING IN THE FORWARD SPEED OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS.  THE 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 315/07.  THE SYNOPTIC REASONING REGARDING
THE TRACK REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM THE LAST SEVERAL ADVISORIES. A
GRADUAL SLOWDOWN IS FORECAST AS STEERING CURRENTS WEAKEN.  THUS...
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY. THIS MEANS THAT THE HURRICANE COULD PRODUCE EXTREMELY
LARGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS COMBINED WITH A LONG PERIOD OF ONSHORE WINDS
AND STORM SURGE FLOODING.  GEORGES IS A VERY SERIOUS THREAT AND IT
COULD BE EVEN WORSE IF THERE IS FURTHER STRENGTHENING.

...CORRECTION FOR INITIAL POSITION 27/2100Z...

THE RADAR PRESENTATION OF THE CENTER OF GEORGES FROM THE NATIONAL
WEATHER SERVICE RADAR IN NEW ORLEANS HAS BEEN RATHER POOR THE LAST
6 HOURS OR SO WITH A 50 PERCENT OPEN EYE WALL.  THE AIR FORCE
RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN REPORTING A SIMILAR EYE
STATE WITH THE OPENING ROTATING FROM THE SOUTH TO NORTHWEST  TO
SOUTHWEST.  THE OPENING HAS BEEN OCCURRING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE 
THE STRONGEST CONVECTION.  THE LATEST RECON...1935Z...NOW REPORTS 
A CLOSED EYE WALL AND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 961 MB. MAXIMUM FLIGHT-
LEVEL WINDS HAVE BEEN HOVERING AROUND 85 KT ALTHOUGH A GPS DROPSONDE
RECORDED A 100 KT WIND AT 952 MB.  WITH NO DATA TO THE CONTRARY THE
INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 95 KT...AND WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGH 24
HOURS. HOWEVER...SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE STILL POSSIBLE
AND GEORGES COULD REACH CATEGORY THREE STATUS PRIOR TO LANDFALL.

SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN NEW ORLEANS
SHOW THAT TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND GUSTS...34 KT...AT 18Z.  DAUPHIN
ISLAND C-MAN BUOY RECENTLY REPORTED A 58 MPH SUSTAINED WIND OVER 
2 MINUTES WITH A PEAK GUST TO HURRICANE FORCE.  BUOY 42040 IS
REPORTING 1-MINUTE SUSTAINED WINDS TO NEAR HURRICANE FORCE A 969.8
MB PRESSURE AND SEAS TO 36 FEET.  THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED
USING THE MOST CURRENT SURFACE REPORTS AND RECONNAISSANCE DATA.

WHILE THE RECONNAISSANCE AND HOURLY RADAR POSITION ESTIMATES HAVE
BEEN SHOWING SOME WOBBLE IN THE CENTER LOCATION THE 6-HOURLY MOTION
IS NORTHWESTWARD. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 320/07 KT.  A
GRADUAL DECELERATION IS STILL FORECAST OVER THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS  
AS ENVIRONMENTAL STEERING COLLAPSES. THE 18Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE
IS MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED ON A NORTHWEST HEADING FOR THE FIRST 24 
TO 36 HOURS WITH BEND TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST THEREAFTER.  NOGAPS
IS THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION WHICH MOVES GEORGES WESTWARD THROUGH THE
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SLIGHTLY RIGHT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY MAINLY DUE TO THE INITIAL POSITION.

THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SLOW-MOVING HURRICANE COULD BE COPIOUS 
RAINFALL IN PORTIONS OF THE WARNING AREA AS WELL AS A PROLONGED 
LONG PERIOD OF ONSHORE WINDS AND STORM SURGE FLOODING.  

THE HURRICANE WATCH EAST OF PANAMA CITY TO ST. MARKS FLORIDA WILL
BE LOWERED.

OUT TO 335/06 AND THE 6 HOUR MOTION IS ONLY 4 KNOTS.  THE TRACK
MODEL GUIDANCE...AGAIN...HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH...AND SHOWS THE

ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BECAUSE OF THE
INITIAL MOTION AND IS THEN SLOWED DOWN EVEN MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  THE GFDL MODEL SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE WEST THROUGH 48
HOURS AND THEN A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH...BUT VERY SLOW AVERAGING
ABOUT 3 KNOTS.  SO AT 24 HOURS...THE OFFICIAL TRACK SHOWS A PARTIAL
LEFT TURN OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE GFDL MODEL.
 
IN ANY CASE...THE SLOW MOTION ALLOWS FOR LOTS OF RAIN...THE GFDL
MODEL SHOWS A MAX OF 62 INCHES OVER EASTERN LOUISIANA.  THIS IS
PROBABLY EXCESSIVE...BUT IS INDICATIVE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS
FRESH WATER FLOODING.  COMBINE THIS WITH STRONG ONSHORE WINDS PILING
UP THE GULF WATERS ALONG THE COAST.  WE ARE TALKING SERIOUS FLOOD
POTENTIAL.
 
THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED 5 KNOTS TO 90 KNOTS BASED ON HRD WIND

THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INTENSITY OR TRACK
FORECASTS.  GEORGES IS MOVING NORTH-NORTHWEST ABOUT 5 KNOTS AND MOST
OF THE MODELS SUGGEST VERY LITTLE MOTION DURING THE NEXT 24 OR 36
HOURS.  IN FACT...THE GFDL KEEPS THE HURRICANE BASICALLY IN THE SAME
AREA THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE AND KEEPS GEORGES DRIFTING ONE A GENERAL NORTH-
NORTHWEST TRACK DURING THE 3 DAYS.  THE SLOW MOTION ALLOWS FOR LOTS
OF RAIN AND THIS IS INDICATIVE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS
FRESH WATER FLOODING.  COMBINE THIS WITH STRONG ONSHORE WINDS PILING
UP THE GULF WATERS ALONG THE COAST.  WE ARE TALKING SERIOUS FLOOD
POTENTIAL.
 
BOTH NOOA AND AIR FORCE PLANE HAVE BEEN IN THE EYE OF GEORGES AND
THE MINIMUM PRESSURES WERE 960 AND 964 MB RESPECTIVELY. A DROP IN
THE EYEWALL RECORDED 101 KNOTS AT THE 920 MB LEVEL AND THIS
COINCIDES WITH DOPPLER WINDS FROM NEW ORLEANS RADAR.  SATELLITE 
SHOWS A WELL DEFINED RING OF DEEP CONVECTION SURROUNDING THE EYE.
THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE HURRICANE REMAINS WITH MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS
OF 90 KNOTS. A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST AFTER THE CENTER MOVES

GEORGES HAS MOVED VERY LITTLE OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS BUT ENOUGH OF
THE CIRCULATION AND CORE HAS MOVED OVER LAND SO THAT WEAKENING IS
OCCURRING.  FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY AS THE SYSTEM MOVES SLOWLY
OVER LAND.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT THE
GFDL MODEL KEEPS GEORGES MEANDERING NOT FAR FROM WHERE IT IS
CURRENTLY LOCATED FOR THE NEXT TWO TO THREE DAYS...BUT OTHER MODELS
SUCH AS THE BAROTROPIC...THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL AND THE DEEP BAM
MOVE GEORGES NEAR TO OR EAST OF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST IN 72
HOURS.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE
AND...PESSIMISTICALLY...KEEPS GEORGES OVER SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI
DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE PERIOD...WITH A LITTLE NORTHEASTWARD
MOTION LATER.  OF COURSE IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THE SYSTEM
MAY MAKE CONTACT WITH STRONGER WESTERLIES AND BE CARRIED
SIGNIFICANTLY FARTHER NORTHEAST OR EAST THAN SHOWN IN THIS FORECAST.

WITH THE SLOW MOVEMENT...HUGE AMOUNTS OF RAIN ARE EXPECTED. 
ADDITIONAL TOTALS OF 20 TO 30 INCHES ARE INDICATED IN THIS ADVISORY.

WARNINGS WILL BE KEPT UP ON THE COAST AS WINDS ARE STILL FAIRLY
STRONG. HOWEVER THE STORM SURGE SHOULD BE DECREASING.

THE TROPICAL CYCLONE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE
A 60-KNOT TROPICAL STORM.  SINCE THE SYSTEM SHOULD REMAIN OVER
LAND...A CONTINUED GRADUAL SPIN-DOWN IS FORECAST.
 
RADAR SHOWS A VERY SLOW MOVEMENT...SLIGHTLY EAST OF NORTH..3 KNOTS
OR SO.  THE LATEST AVN MODEL RUN SUGGESTS ENOUGH OF A BREAK IN THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO ALLOW GEORGES TO MOVE NORTHWARD...THEN
NORTHEASTWARD AND EAST-NORTHEASTWARD IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  HOWEVER
OTHER GUIDANCE SUCH AS THE NOGAPS SHOWS LITTLE MOTION.  THE CURRENT
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NOT QUITE AS PESSIMISTIC AS THE PREVIOUS
ONE...BUT STILL HAS GEORGES LINGERING ABOUT OVER ALABAMA IN 2 TO 3
DAYS.  GUIDANCE SUCH AS LBAR AND THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL MODEL
MOVE GEORGES MUCH FARTHER TO EAST-NORTHEAST.
 
THE PRIMARY THREAT FROM GEORGES IS SHIFTING TO THAT OF HEAVY
PRECIPITATION AND SEVERE LOCAL STORMS.  OBVIOUSLY...THE MAGNITUDE OF
FRESHWATER FLOODING DEPENDS ON HOW SLOWLY THE SYSTEM MOVES DURING
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.
 
EVEN THOUGH GEORGES HAS BEEN INLAND SINCE THIS MORNING...BECAUSE OF
ITS SIZE AND SLOW MOVEMENT...TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS ARE PROBABLY
STILL OCCURRING OVER A PORTION OF THE COASTLINE.  THEREFORE THE
HURRICANE WARNING IS BEING CHANGED TO A TROPICAL STORM WARNING

THE MOBILE RADAR SHOWS THAT THE CENTER OF GEORGES HAS MOVED IN A
SMALL CYCLONIC LOOP OVER THE PAST 8 TO 10 HOURS.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE
TOO SURPRISING AS SOME OF THE MODELS HAVE BEEN PREDICTING VERY
LITTLE MOTION.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 160/04.
 
MODEL GUIDANCE...
THE LBAR AND AVIATION MODEL AS WELL AS A STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL MODEL
MOVE GEORGES MOSTLY EASTWARD ACROSS GEORGIA AND OFF THE EAST COAST
IN 72 HOURS. THE NOGAPS TRACK IS SLOW NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD FOR 24
HOURS AND THEN LOSES THE CIRCULATION.  THE UKMET SHOWS VERY LITTLE
MOTION FOR 72 HOURS AND THE GFDL SHOWS SLOW SOUTHEAST TO EASTWARD
MOTION TO OVER THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE IN 72 HOURS.
 
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS FOR A SLOW MOSTLY EASTWARD DRIFT FOR
72 HOURS AS A KIND OF CONSENSUS OF THE ABOVE GUIDANCE.
 
A REPORT OF 39 KNOT SUSTAINED WIND SPEED FROM HURBURT FIELD IN THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE ALONG WITH 35 TO 50 KNOT WINDS FROM THE MOBILE
RADAR SOUTH OF THE CENTER AT 1000 FT OR SO ELEVATION IS THE BASIS
FOR KEEPING GEORGES AS A TROPICAL STORM.  AND IT MAY REMAIN SO FOR A

GEORGES BROKE OUT OF ITS SMALL CYCLONIC LOOP AND IS NOW HEADING
EAST-NORTHEAST AT ABOUT 7 KT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A
CONTINUED ENE TO E MOTION AND IS SIMILAR TO A CLUSTER OF MODEL
FORECAST TRACKS.  

THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL FLOODING PERSISTS AS SOME OF THE
GUIDANCE INDICATES A RE-SLOWING...IMPLYING THAT WESTERLIES MIGHT NOT
PICK UP GEORGES...OR ITS REMNANTS...FOR A FEW DAYS.  FOR EXAMPLE...
THE GFDL AND NOGAPS SHOW SMALL CLOCKWISE LOOPS WHILE THE UKMET HAS A

GEORGES HAS CONTINUED TO SLOWLY WEAKEN AND SUSTAINED WINDS APPEAR TO
HAVE FINALLY FALLEN BELOW TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  THE CYCLONE IS
FORECAST TO REMAIN INLAND FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO...SO FURTHER
WEAKENING IS LIKELY.

GEORGES HAS BEEN MOVING SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD...AROUND 5 KNOTS...AND
A CONTINUED SLOW MOTION IS PREDICTED.  HOWEVER SOME OF THE TRACK
MODELS INDICATE THAT THE LOW WILL EMERGE INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. 
IF THIS HAPPENS...THERE IS A CHANCE FOR REGENERATION.  ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY IS THAT GEORGES REMNANTS COULD MERGE WITH THE COLD FRONT
THAT IS LIKELY TO MOVE OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST THURSDAY EVENING.

THE THREAT OF VERY HEAVY RAINS AND TORNADOES ASSOCIATED WITH GEORGES
CONTINUES.  RADAR AND SATELLITE SHOWS STRONG BANDS OF CONVECTION
PERSISTING OVER PORTIONS OF WESTERN FLORIDA...SOUTHERN ALABAMA AND
GEORGIA.

THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER ON

THERE ARE MANY SATELLITE EXPERTS OUT THERE...AND WE KNOW THAT THEY
ARE SAYING THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW DEPRESSION
IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IS NOT THE TYPICAL ONE...OF COURSE IT IS NOT.
HOWEVER...A COUPLE OF AN AIR FORCE PLANES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING
THE AREA TODAY AND FOUND A VERY TIGHT AND WELL DEFINED CIRCULATION
WITH 30 TO 35 KNOT WINDS CLOSE TO THE CENTER.  THERE ARE ALSO
CLUSTERS OF DEEP CONVECTION MAINLY TO THE SOUTH OF THE CENTER. 
BASED ON THIS INFORMATION THE SYSTEM IS BEING UPGRADED TO TROPICAL
DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME.  THE ENVIRONMENT IS HOSTILE FOR DEVELOPMENT
AT THIS TIME TO DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE SYSTEM TO A LARGE UPPER-
LOW OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.  MODELS ARE FORECASTING
THAT THE UPPER-LOW WILL WEAKEN AND THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPRESSION
TO STRENGTHEN AS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION IS 270/04. A GENERAL TRACK TOWARD THE WEST AND THEN
NORTHWEST SHOULD CONTINUE AS THE DEPRESSION MOVES TO THE NORTH OF
THE UPPER LOW.  THEREAFTER...MOST OF THE MODELS TURN THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO THE NORTH AND NORTH-NORTHEAST AHEAD OF A NEW TROUGH. 

TRACK AND INTENSITY FORECASTS REQUIRES A TROPICAL STORM WATCH AT
THIS TIME FROM SARGENT TEXAS TO GRAND ISLE LOUISIANA. THIS LARGE

11 PM EDT THU SEP 17 1998
 
CENTER FIXES FROM THE HURRICANE HUNTERS SHOWED A SOUTHWEST MOVEMENT
OF ABOUT 5 KT THIS EVENING.  THIS MOTION AND THE TRACK OVER THE PAST
24-36 HOURS SUGGEST THAT THE TD IS SLOWLY ORBITING AROUND THE
BROADER CYCLONIC CIRCULATION THAT IS CENTERED TO THE SOUTHEAST AND
WHICH COVERS MUCH OF THE GULF OF MEXICO.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
CLEARLY DEPICTS THE MID TO UPPER-LEVEL PART OF THAT CIRCULATION
CENTERED NEAR 24N90W.
 
THE PRIMARY QUESTION FOR THE TRACK FORECAST IS...AT WHAT POINT AND
TIME WILL THE TD BE RELEASED FROM THE GRIP OF THE UPPER LOW?  THE
18Z AVN WEAKENS THE UPPER LOW AND MOVES IT TO SE LA BY ABOUT 36
HOURS.  THE 12Z NOGAPS OPENS THE LOW NEAR THE TX/LA COAST IN ABOUT
48 HOURS.  EITHER OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS WOULD IMPLY THAT A NORTHWARD
COMPONENT COULD BE UNDERWAY IN ANOTHER DAY OR SO.  HENCE...ALTHOUGH
THE TRACK OF THE TD COULD FOLLOW A CUSP OR SMALL CYCLONIC LOOP IN
THE INTERIM...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DOESNT GET SO FANCY.  IT SHOWS
LITTLE MOVEMENT FOR 12 TO 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A GENERAL NORTHWARD
OR NORTHEASTWARD HEADING.

CONVECTION HAS INCREASED A LITTLE AND A 37 KT WIND WAS REPORTED AT
1500 FEET FROM THE RECON PLANE.  HENCE...THE SYSTEM IS APPROACHING
TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH AND SOME INTENSIFICATION IS AGAIN FORECAST.

FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS TREND AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACK BUT A LITTLE MORE TO THE WEST.

 
CONVECTION HAS REMAINED ABOUT CONSTANT AND MAXIMUM WINDS REPORTED

WARMER THAN THE ENVIRONMENT.  MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS SO FAR ARE
38 KNOTS WHICH INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM IS STILL A TROPICAL
DEPRESSION.  THE ENVIRONMENT IS SOMEWHAT HOSTILE FOR STRENGTHENING

THE DEPRESSION IS DRIFTING NORTHWARD BUT WITH THE APPROACHING MID TO

IS FORECAST WITH SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED. THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE.

...CORRECTION...POSSIBLE NEW CENTER POSITION 26.5N 91.8W
 
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WAS ABLE TO LOCATE THE CENTER OF DEPRESSION
EIGHT AS A VERY WEAK VORTEX WITH LIGHT WINDS NEAR THE CENTER.
HIGHEST WINDS WERE NEARLY 40 KNOTS AT FLIGHT LEVEL NEAR THE
CONVECTION LOCATED SOME 120 NM NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  DEEP
CONVECTION CONTINUES TO BURST OVER A SMALL AREA NEARLY TWO TO THREE
DEGREES NORTHEAST OF THIS CENTER.  GIVEN THE CONTINUED SHEARED
ENVIRONMENT ...THE CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 30 KNOTS AND THE
FORECAST INTENSITY REDUCED TO 35 KNOTS FOR ALL PERIODS EXCEPT FOR
THE LAST WHERE 20 KNOTS IS FORECAST OVER LAND.  IF THIS SHEARING
CONTINUES...IT APPEARS UNLIKELY THAT THE SYSTEM WILL REGAIN DEEP
CONVECTION AND ATTAIN TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY AT ALL.
 
THE DEPRESSION REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY...EXCEPTING THE SMALL
EAST SOUTHEASTWARD DRIFT.  IT IS FORECAST TO REMAIN EFFECTIVELY
STATIONARY THROUGH THE 12-HOUR FORECAST PERIOD BEFORE MOVING NORTH
AND NORTHEAST.  THIS MOTION IS FORECAST AS AN UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH...LOCATED PRESENTLY OVER WEST TEXAS...MOVES EASTWARD.  IF THE
SYSTEM FAILS TO REGAIN DEEP CONVECTION...THE LOW-LEVEL VORTEX WILL
BE STEERED MORE BY THE LOWER LEVEL FLOW.

AFTER THE ABOVE DISCUSSION WAS WRITTEN THE RECONN AIRCRAFT FOUND
ANOTHER CENTER NEAR 26.5N 91.8W.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE CENTER
MOVED 60NM IN 2 HOURS BUT SINCE THIS CENTER IS SOMEWHAT CLOSER TO
THE DEEP CONVECTION...A NEW CENTER MAYBE FORMING.  IN ANY CASE...IF
TRUE...THE FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS ARE STILL 15 TO 20 KNOTS NEAR THIS NEW
CENTER AND THE MORE NORTHERLY POSITION IS STILL COVERED BY THE WATCH
AREA.  FIRST VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOULD CLARIFY THIS

THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER STRENGTHENING SINCE THIS MORNING.  IN
FACT...IT NOW APPEARS THAT WINDS OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE ARE
CONFINED TO THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE IN AREAS OF STRONGER CONVECTION. 
THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS AGAIN LOCATED WEST-SOUTHWEST OF THE DENSE
OVERCAST.  LATEST ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS
SHOW WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR OF 20 TO 25 KNOTS AHEAD OF
THE SYSTEM...NEAR THE CENTRAL GULF COAST.  THIS ENVIRONMENT SHOULD
NOT ALLOW ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STRENGTH THROUGH TONIGHT...
AFTER WHICH TIME HERMINE IS FORECAST TO BE INLAND.

RECON AND SATELLITE FIXES GIVE A NORTHWARD MOTION OF 6 TO 8 KNOTS. 
USING THIS MOTION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CARRIES THE CENTER INLAND
WITHIN 12 HOURS WITH A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST THEREAFTER.  A MORE
NORTHEASTWARD TRACK...BEFORE LANDFALL...IS LOOKING LESS LIKELY SINCE
NEARLY ALL OF THE NUMERICAL GUIDANCE IS SPREAD BETWEEN A 340 TO 030

DEEP CONVECTION IS SOMEWHAT RAGGED LOOKING...BUT IT CONTINUES TO BE
RATHER PERSISTENT NEAR THE SUSPECTED CENTER.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS
ESTIMATED AT 35 KNOTS...WHICH UPGRADES TD9 TO TROPICAL STORM IVAN. 
THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND
SAB. A MODEST AMOUNT OF STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST IN THE SHORT
TERM...BUT SHEARING CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO INHIBIT SIGNIFICANT
DEVELOPMENT.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/12.  CURRENT FORECAST TRACK IS
ADJUSTED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND IS IN
BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE SHALLOW BAM.  IF THE SYSTEM DEVELOPS MORE
THAN EXPECTED...IS WOULD LIKELY TURN MORE TOWARD THE NORTH IN
RESPONSE TO DEEPER LAYER STEERING.

A SHEARING PATTERN CONTINUES TO INHIBIT THE STRENGTHENING OF IVAN. 
DEEP CONVECTION CONTINUES NEAR THE CENTER...ALTHOUGH IT IS RAGGED IN
APPEARANCE AND IS REFLECTED IN THE T-NUMBERS WHICH ARE
2.0/2.5/2.0...SO THAT IVAN IS A BORDER LINE TROPICAL STORM. THE
INITIAL ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 35 KNOTS...ALTHOUGH THE FORECAST IS FOR
WEAKENING TO DEPRESSION INTENSITY IN 24 HOURS IN LINE WITH FORECAST
OF INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR.  THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO RETURN BACK
TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS IN 72 HOURS AS THE SHEAR IS REDUCED.  BOTH
THE SHIPS AND THE GFDL INTENSITY FORECASTS ALSO SUPPORT THIS.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 295/12.  THE MODEL TRACK
FORECASTS ARE IN BETTER AGREEMENT THAN IN PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND TAKE
THE SYSTEM NORTHWEST...BUT WITH VARYING SPEEDS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST REFLECTS NHC AND HPC INPUT AND IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE

A MODERATE SHEARING PATTERN PERSISTS WITH THE CIRCULATION CENTER
ESTIMATED TO BE UNDER THE WESTERN PART OF THE SMALL CENTRAL DENSE
OVERCAST.  THE INITIAL HEADING IS ADJUSTED TO 310 DEGREES AT 12 KT.
 
AN ELONGATED TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWARD FROM 30N TO SOUTHWEST OF
IVAN IS INDUCING THE CURRENT SHEAR.  IF THE DEPTH OF THIS FEATURE IS
GREAT ENOUGH IT WILL TURN THE STORM MORE TOWARD THE NORTH IN TIME
WITH THE SHEAR POTENTIALLY DECREASING.  ALTERNATELY...IF IT IS
RATHER SHALLOW...THEN IVAN COULD CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD THE WEST-
NORTHWEST BUT BECOME EVEN MORE SHEARED.  MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE
AND THE NHC FORECAST IS BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES...SUGGESTING A NW

IVAN CONTINUES TO BE SHEARED FROM THE WEST-SOUTHWEST BUT APPLICATION
OF THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE...WHICH ALLOWS FOR THAT PATTERN...SUGGESTS
THAT THE SYSTEM HAS STRENGTHENED A LITTLE.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
ESTIMATED TO BE 40 KT.  

THE HEADING APPEARS TO HAVE EASED OVER TO 320/10 KT.  MOST OF THE
GUIDANCE SHOWS A CONTINUATION OF THAT TRACK THROUGH 48 HOURS.  AFTER
THAT TIME...THE TRACKS DIVERGE WITH HEADINGS FROM WNW TO NE SHOWN. 
THE ENTIRE RANGE IS POSSIBLE DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE UPPER TROUGH

IVAN HAS ACCELERATED TO ABOUT 20 KT DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS...WITH A
12-HOUR MOTION ESTIMATED AT 355/14 KT.   THE INCREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED IS LIKELY THE RESULT OF IVAN BEING CAUGHT IN THE CIRCULATION
AROUND THE UPPER-LOW CUTTING OFF TO THE SSW.  

THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FUTURE TRACK.  AS THE
INTERACTION WITH THE UPPER LOW ENDS...SOME DECELERATION AND A TURN
MORE TOWARD THE NW ARE POSSIBLE.  THE GFDL...UKMET...NOGAPS...AND
BAMS ALL SHOW THIS.  MEANWHILE...THE OTHER GUIDANCE SHOWS A
CONTINUING RECURVATURE.  THIS OFFICIAL FORECAST LEANS BACK A LITTLE
TOWARD THE FORMER OPTION AS...AT THE MOMENT..THIS SEEMS TO BE MOST
CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT LARGE-SCALE PATTERN AND EXPECTED
EVOLUTION.

ITS DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY THE SYSTEM BASED ON THE SATELLITE-BASED 
DVORAK INTENSITY SCHEME.  IN FACT THE SYSTEM HAS SOME SUBTROPICAL-
TYPE CHARACTERISTICS.  BOTH TAFB AND SAB SHOW A WEAKENING TREND
OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE REDUCED

IS DROPPING SOUTHWARD AND IS SHEARING THE SYSTEM.  THE INTENSITY 
WILL BE HELD AT 45 KNOTS THROUGH 72 HOURS. THE SYSTEM MAY BECOME
EXTRA-TROPICAL BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD. 
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 330/12 KNOTS.  THE PRIMARY
STEERING MECHANISM FOR THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL BE THE TROUGH
TO THE WEST OF IVAN.  MOST OF THE 00 TRACK MODEL SUITE SHOW A
NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 48 HOURS WITH A TURN TO THE NORTH
THEREAFTER.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO 
AND IS SIMILAR THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN

IS IN FAIRLY CLOSE AGREEMENT SHOWING A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE
NORTH BY 24 HOURS...AND A BEND TOWARD THE NORTHEAST BY 48 HOURS.
 
FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE LATE 18Z SHIP REPORT AND EARLIER REPORTS
FROM THE SAME SHIP...ID PJOX...REPORTING AN EAST WIND OF 75 KNOTS
LOCATED ABOUT 70 NM NORTHEAST OF IVAN AT THE TIME SUGGEST THAT THE
OBS ARE DOUBLE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE.  THUS 75 KT WIND IS REALLY 37
KTS. THIS FITS WITH COMPACT WIND FIELD AS ESTIMATED BY VISIBLE AND

JEANNE CONTINUES TO INTENSIFY.  A RATHER SOLID AND MODERATE-SIZED
CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST IS APPARENT WITH A DISTINCT BAND TO THE NW
THROUGH NORTH.  T-NUMBERS ARE UP TO 3.5...SO 55 KT WILL BE THE
INITIAL WIND SPEED.
 
THE MOTION IS LITTLE CHANGED...295/15 KT.  THE 00Z NOGAPS SHOWS A
HIGH EXTENDING FROM NORTH OF JEANNE WESTWARD TO ABOUT 35W.  THIS
SHOULD KEEP THE STORM ON A WNW HEADING THROUGH 48 TO 72 HOURS.  THE
TRACK GUIDANCE AND OFFICIAL FORECAST ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH
THAT EXPECTATION.

FURTHER STRENGTHENING ALONG THE LINES OF THE SHIPS MODEL OUTPUT IS
SHOWN.

SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED
NEAR THE CENTER OF JEANNE AND THE BANDING FEATURE WRAPS ALMOST
FULLY AROUND THE SYSTEM.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB 
AND SAB ARE 4.0. THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 70 KNOTS FOR
THIS ADVISORY.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH NEAR
40W WHICH IS FORECAST BY THE GLOBAL MODELS TO PERSIST THROUGH THE
72-HOUR PERIOD.  THE ASSOCIATED SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR
WILL LIKELY LIMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF JEANNE BEYOND 24 HOURS. 
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/14 KNOTS.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE
NORTH OF JEANNE SHOULD CONTINUE TO STEER THE SYSTEM ON A GENERAL
WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE THROUGH 72 HOURS...AND MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE REFLECTS THIS AS DOES THE OFFICIAL NHC FORECAST. THIS TRACK
IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

5 PM EDT FRI SEP 25 1998

IN THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS JEANNE HAS LOOKED LESS IMPRESSIVE ON
SATELLITE IMAGERY AND DVORAK CI NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 4.5.
THEREFORE...THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS 80 KNOTS. ALTHOUGH THE
OUTFLOW ON VISIBLE IMAGERY STILL LOOKS FAIRLY WELL
ESTABLISHED...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE STORM IS BEING
IMPACTED BY WESTERLY SHEAR. THE WESTERLIES IMPACTING JEANNE APPEAR
TO BE AT A LOWER LEVEL THAN THAT OF THE CIRRUS OUTFLOW.  ALTHOUGH
THE SYNOPTIC ENVIRONMENT IS NOT IDEAL...THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL
AND GFDL MODEL SUGGEST THAT THE JEANNE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO
MAINTAIN HURRICANE INTENSITY THROUGH 72 HOURS. 
 
RECENT SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES ARE A LITTLE NORTH OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK SUGGESTING THAT JEANNE IS NOW MAKING ITS
ANTICIPATED TURN TO THE NORTH. THE CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/10
KNOTS. THE TRACK MODELS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLUSTER...WITH THE
LBAR...UKMET...AND NHC98 MODELS SLOWER AND MORE TO THE EAST OF THE
OTHER GUIDANCE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST...BUT A LITTLE FURTHER TO THE EAST.

11 PM EDT FRI SEP 25 1998

JEANNE HAS CONTINUED TO LOOK RAGGED ON IR SATELLITE IMAGERY AND
DVORAK CI NUMBERS ARE 4.5. THEREFORE THE INTENSITY IS ESTIMATED AT
75 KNOTS. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE STORM IS BEING
SHEARED BY AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. HOWEVER THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL
AND THE GFDL MODEL CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT THE STORM WILL REMAIN A
HURRICANE THROUGH 72 HOURS. IF THE SHEAR RELAXES IN THE NEXT DAY OR
SO...AS SUGGESTED BY THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IN THE
AVN FORECAST...STRENGTHENING MIGHT STILL BE POSSIBLE. AS A
COMPROMISE...THE INTENSITY IS HELD CONSTANT THROUGH 72 HOURS. 

ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE A GENERAL NORTHWARD MOTION
FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE CURRENT MOTION IS 325/9 KNOTS...BUT
AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED IS EXPECTED. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE EAST OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...SINCE THE
GFDL...UKMET...AND LBAR MODELS INDICATE A NORTH NORTHEAST MOTION
AFTER 48 HOURS.

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER REMAINS UNDER THE DENSE CONVECTIVE
OVERCAST...AND CURRENT DVORAK CI NUMBERS FROM THE TROPICAL
PREDICTION CENTER AND THE SYNOPTIC ANALYSIS BRANCH ARE 4.0.  THUS
THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS 65 KNOTS.  NO SIGNIFICANT
CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST.  HOWEVER THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT
PARTICULARLY HOSTILE...SO THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE THAT
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  NEAR THE END
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...COOLER WATERS ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE
WEAKENING.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 12Z GFDL MODEL GUIDANCE.

LATEST FIXES SHOW THAT THE MOTION IS STILL NORTH-NORTHWESTWARD...AT
AROUND 10 KNOTS.  JEANNE IS MOVING AROUND THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A
500 MB ANTICYCLONE...AND WILL ENCOUNTER AN INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY
STEERING FLOW AFTER CROSSING 30N.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
A BLEND OF THE AVAILABLE GUIDANCE AND SHOWS ACCELERATION TO AROUND
25 KNOTS IN 48 HOURS OR SO.

THE CENTER IS NOT WELL DEFINED IN GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE IMAGERY
BUT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER APPEARS TO BE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE CENTRAL
DENSE OVERCAST.  AN SSM/I PASS FROM 26/2215Z CAUGHT ABOUT HALF OF
THE CIRCULATION...AND HELPS A LITTLE WITH THE LOCATION.  INITIAL
INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 70 KNOTS WHICH IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN
VARIOUS SATELLITE ESTIMATES.  THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT PARTICULARLY
HOSTILE...SO SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST UNTIL THE
SYSTEM MOVES OVER COOLER WATER.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 340/10.  JEANNE IS BEING STEERED AROUND
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE...AND IS ABOUT TO
BE INFLUENCED BY A BROAD MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE WEST.
RECURVATURE WITH ACCELERATION IS FORECAST.  THE CURRENT TRACK IS
BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS A REASONABLE

SINCE THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 70
KNOTS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE SYSTEM EMBEDDED IN A MUCH
LARGER ANTICYCLONE... SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED TO HURRICANE IVAN

POSSIBLE.  IN ANY EVENT...JEANNE SHOULD BE LOSING TROPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS AFTER IT PASSES THE AZORES.

THE HURRICANE CONTINUES TO MOVE AROUND THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A
LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH OVER THE EASTERN ATLANTIC...AND WILL
BEGIN TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE HIGHER-LATITUDE WESTERLIES SOON.  THE
CURRENT MOTION IS SLIGHTLY EAST OF NORTH AND THE TRACK

ALTHOUGH THE FORWARD SPEED HAS INCREASED TODAY...TO AROUND 15
KNOTS...THE 18Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS CONSIDERABLY SLOWER THAN
BEFORE.  THE LATEST AVN FORECAST AT 500 MB FORECASTS THE RIDGE OVER
THE EASTERN ATLANTIC TO BUILD NORTHWARD MORE THAN PREVIOUSLY
INDICATED.  AS A RESULT...THE STRONGER WESTERLIES SHIFT FARTHER
NORTH...AND THE STEERING FLOW DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD IS NOT AS
FAST AS SHOWN IN THE PREVIOUS MODEL RUN.  CONSEQUENTLY...THE CURRENT
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SLOWER THAN THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
PACKAGE.  HOWEVER IT STILL HAS JEANNE APPROACHING THE AZORES IN
ABOUT 48 HOURS.

INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE UNCHANGED...AVERAGING AROUND 70 KNOTS.  THE
CENTER IS STILL UNDER THE DEEP CONVECTION.  LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH IS PREDICTED UNTIL THE SYSTEM PASSES THE AZORES...AT WHICH
TIME IT WILL LIKELY BE LOSING ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS.  HOWEVER
THERE ARE NOW SOME INDICATIONS THAT INCREASING SHEAR COULD WEAKEN

HURRICANE INTENSITY.  THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS STILL UNDER THE DEEP

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING SHOWS THAT JEANNE IS A
HEALTHY HURRICANE.  THE CENTER IS EMBEDDED WITHIN AN AREA OF DEEP
CONVECTION WITH DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB
AT 4.5.  ACCORDINGLY...THE INTENSITY WILL BE INCREASED TO 75 KNOTS.
THE OUTFLOW IS FAIRLY WELL-DEVELOPED OVER MOST OF THE SYSTEM AND
ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE
STUDIES...CIMSS..INDICATE THAT A LOW VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ENVIRONMENT
SHOULD PERSIST FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  JEANNE SHOULD WEAKEN BELOW
HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 36 HOURS AS IT APPROACHES PROGRESSIVELY COOLER
WATERS...23-24 DEG C.  THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO EXTRA-TROPICAL
STATUS BY 48 HOURS.
 
SATELLITE FIXES SUGGEST THAT JEANNE HAS ACCELERATED A BIT OVER THE
LAST 12 HOURS AND IS NOW MOVING NEAR 025/20 KNOTS.  THE MID-LEVEL
TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH NEAR 60W WHICH IS STEERING THIS SYSTEM IS
FORECAST TO MOVE NORTHEAST AND DE-AMPLIFY.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW THE
FORWARD MOTION TO SLOW AS THE TRACK BENDS TO THE EAST-NORTHEAST.
THE TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS TWO PRIMARY SOLUTIONS WITH ONE GROUP OF
MODELS KEEPING THE SYSTEM ON A NORTH-NORTHEAST TO NORTHEAST COURSE
AND ANOTHER MOVING JEANNE NORTHEAST THROUGH 24 HOURS WITH A EAST
TO SOUTHEASTERLY TRACK BEYOND.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE SHOWING A EAST-NORTHEAST MOTION AFTER

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON SEP 28 1998
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW A LARGE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION.
THE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATE DEPENDS ON WHERE THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER
IS LOCATED IN RELATION TO THE DEEP CONVECTION...AND THERE IS OVER 60
NMI SCATTER IN THE FIXES FROM SAB...TAFB...AND KGWC.  INITIAL
INTENSITY REMAINS AT 80 KNOTS...WHICH IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN
VARIOUS SATELLITE ESTIMATES.  GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST SINCE
JEANNE IS BEGINNING TO MOVE OVER WATER COOLER THAN 26C.  THE SYSTEM
WILL LIKELY BECOME EXTRATROPICAL WITHIN 36 TO 48 HOURS.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 040/18.  CONSIDERABLE SCATTER EXISTS IN
THE GUIDANCE MODELS...BUT NEARLY ALL SUGGEST THAT STEERING CURRENTS
WILL CONTINUE THE NORTHEASTWARD MOTION FOR ANOTHER 24 HOURS OR SO. 
THEREAFTER...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE SHOULD BE CAUGHT UP IN THE
WESTERLIES.  CURRENT TRACK IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE MID LAYER BAM AND AVIATION
MODELS.  THE UKMET AND GFDL SUGGEST A LITTLE MOTION SOUTH OF EAST
AFTER 36 OR 48 HOURS...WHICH IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER ON IR IMAGERY.  WHILE DEEP
CONVECTION IS PRESENT...IT IS NOT WELL-ORGANIZED AND THE SYSTEM
APPEARS TO BE UNDER WESTERLY SHEAR.  DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE DECREASING
BUT CI NUMBERS ARE UNCHANGED...AND SO IS THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM WIND
SPEED...80 KT.
 
EVEN WITH THE UNCERTAINTY IN POSITIONING...IT APPEARS THAT THE TRACK
OF JEANNE HAS TURNED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT.  INITIAL MOTION IS NEAR
060/18 KT.  ONE SHORT-WAVE TROUGH IS BYPASSING JEANNE TO THE
NORTH...BUT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE HURRICANE SHOULD
GRADUALLY BECOME PICKED UP BY THE WESTERLIES DURING THE NEXT DAY OR
TWO.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A MORE EASTWARD TRACK WITH TIME. 
THIS TAKES JEANNE INTO COOL WATERS WHERE WEAKENING AND A TRANSITION
TO EXTRATROPICAL IS LIKELY.

THE SYSTEM COULD BRING TROPICAL STORM OR...LESS LIKELY...HURRICANE
CONDITIONS TO THE AZORES WITHIN ABOUT 24 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 060/09.
 
MODEL GUIDANCE...
THE AVIATION MODEL AND NOGAPS SHOW A MOSTLY NORTHEASTWARD MOTION
THROUGH 72 HOURS WHILE THE GFDL AND LBAR SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE
EAST.  THE UKMET SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH APPARENTLY IN
RESPONSE TO A FRONTAL LOW TO THE WEST OF THE STORM OVERTAKING IT AND
ADVECTING IT NORTHWARD.  THE BAM MODELS SUGGEST THAT A STRONGER
SYSTEM WITH MORE VERTICAL EXTENT WILL HAVE MORE OF AN EASTWARD
COMPONENT THAN A WEAKER SHEARED SYSTEM.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A CONSENSUS OF THE MODELS AND IS A
LITTLE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST...BASED ON A CONTINUATION
OF THE SHEARING WHICH IS OCCURRING.
 
THIS SHEARING IS CAUSING THE LOW LEVEL CENTER TO BE EXPOSED TO THE
WEST OF THE CONVECTION AND IS THE BASIS FOR DECREASING THE CURRENT
WIND SPEED TO 50 KNOTS AND FOR FORECASTING CONTINUED WEAKENING.
COOLER SSTS ALSO ARE PART OF THE REASONING FOR WEAKENING.  THE
OVERTAKING FRONTAL LOW MAY ALSO BE THE MECHANISM FOR CAUSING JEANNE
TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL...PERHAPS IN 24 TO 36 HOURS...IF NOT SOONER.

TROPICAL STORM LISA DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON OCT 05 1998
 
THE STRONG TROPICAL WAVE THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR SEVERAL
DAYS DISPLAYED A FAIRLY WELL DEFINED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION ON
VISIBLE IMAGERY TODAY.  THE WEST HALF OF THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION
IS EXPOSED BUT THERE IS DEEP CONVECTION ON THE EAST SIDE.  AN
OBSERVATION OF 45 KNOTS FROM A DRIFTING BOUY IN THE DEEP CONVECTION
AT ABOUT 11Z IS THE BASIS FOR CALLING THIS SYSTEM A TROPICAL STORM. 
LISA MAY HAVE BEEN A STORM FOR 18 HOURS OR MORE...BUT IT WAS NOT
UNTIL THE CENTER BECAME VISIBLE THIS MORNING THAT THIS WAS KNOWN TO
BE THE CASE.  THE SHEARING IMPLIED BY THE EXPOSED CENTER AND STRONG
WESTERLIES IS THE BASIS ASSUMING THAT WEAKENING HAS OCCURRED TODAY.

THE TRACK GUIDANCE ALL SHOWS THE SYSTEM BEING RECURVED BY A MAJOR
TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES IN 72 HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
IS SIMILAR TO THE GFDL AND AVIATION AND LBAR MODELS.  A POSSIBILTY
IS THAT A STRONG BAROCLINIC SYSTEM WILL ABSORB THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
...RESULTING IN A STRONGER SYSTEM THAN FORECAST IN THIS ADVISORY.
THE FORECAST TRACK INDICATES NO THREAT TO LAND.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON OCT 05 1998

LOCATING THE CENTER ON SHEARED TROPICAL CYCLONES WITH INFRARED
IMAGERY IS USUALLY QUITE DIFFICULT...AND THIS ONE IS NO EXCEPTION. 
HOWEVER THE TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTERS INFRARED COMBINATION CHANNEL
IMAGERY REVEALS ENOUGH OF THE LOW CLOUD LINES OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE SO THAT THE CENTER IS ESTIMATED NEAR THE SOUTHWEST EDGE
OF THE MAIN DENSE OVERCAST.  THIS LOCATION GIVES A SLIGHTLY SLOWER
FORWARD SPEED...305/10.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A HIGH
AMPLITUDE MID-TROPOSPHERIC PATTERN...WITH A MAJOR TROUGH DIGGING IN
THE WEST-CENTRAL ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 
CONSISTENT WITH THIS STEERING PATTERN...THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST...AND SO DOES THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THIS IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE TRACK FORECAST FROM
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. 

AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW IN THE VICINITY OF 21N 54W IS CONTRIBUTING TO
SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR OVER THE TROPICAL STORM.  CURRENT
INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS NEAR 40 KNOTS.  LISA HAS A FAIRLY LARGE
CIRCULATION AND IT MAY BE MORE RESILIENT TO SHEAR THAN A VERY SMALL
STORM...WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE DISSIPATING IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT. 
HOWEVER THE SHEARING IS NOT EXPECTED TO RELAX SO STRENGTHENING IS
NOT LIKELY.  LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD OR BEYOND...LISA MAY BE
INTERACTING WITH A FRONTAL ZONE AND COULD UNDERGO SOME BAROCLINIC
DEVELOPMENT.

TONIGHT COULD BE A TRIUMPH FOR NEW...OR RELATIVELY NEW...
TECHNOLOGY.  THE CENTER OF LISA WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PINPOINT ON
CONVENTIONAL IR METEOSAT AND GOES8 IMAGERY...WITH SOME ANALYSES OF
THAT DATA GIVING A MISLEADING IMPRESSION THAT THE CENTER HAD
ACCELERATED TO ABOUT 14 KT ALONG 305 DEGREES.  ON THE OTHER
HAND...THE SPECIAL NIGHT IR CHANNEL ON THE GOES8 SPACECRAFT PROVIDES
A CLEARER VIEW. IT SHOWS THE SYSTEM TO HAVE SLOWED...TO 6 KT...AND
PERHAPS TO HAVE BEGUN ITS TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  INITIAL HEADING IS
ESTIMATED TO BE 335 DEGREES OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.
 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW NEAR 23N 54W.  FLOW
AROUND THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE LOW CONTINUES TO SHEAR LISA.  THE
00Z AVN AND NOGAPS INDICATE THAT BOTH FEATURES ARE LIKELY TO BE
FORCED N TO NE BY THE DEEP LOW TO CUTOFF FROM THE WESTERLIES OVER
THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS GENERALLY FOLLOW SUIT. 
BY 72 HOURS...THE AVN SHOWS LISA MERGING WITH THE ASSOCIATED
BAROCLINIC ZONE...BUT THERE IS SOME DOUBT AS TO WHETHER A TROPICAL
STORM AS LARGE AS THIS CAN BE SO QUICKLY AND COMPLETELY ABSORBED AT
SUCH A LOW LATITUDE...NEAR 30N.  THE NOGAPS SHOWS A HYBRID SYSTEM
EVENTUALLY DEVELOPING FROM THE INTERACTION.  EITHER WAY...
SIGNIFICANT NORTHWARD ACCELERATION IS LIKELY BY 72 HOURS.
 
ALTHOUGH DEEP CONVECTION HAS RECENTLY DIMINISHED IN COVERAGE...
INTENSIFICATION IS POSSIBLE IN THE SHORT TERM IF LISA BEGINS TO MOVE
TOWARD THE NE.  THE STORM COULD ALSO STRENGTHEN LATER ON IN RESPONSE
TO BAROCLINIC EFFECTS.  BOTH THE SHIPS AND GFDL SCHEMES INDICATE
STRENGTHENING.

LISA HAS BEGUN TO MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST ABOUT 10 KNOTS AHEAD OF
A MAJOR MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC AND AROUND
A LARGE UPPER-LOW CENTERED NEAR 21N 55W.  THIS PATTERN IS PRODUCING
MID TO UPPER LEVEL WESTERLIES BASICALLY OVER MOST OF THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC AND THE CARIBBEAN AS CLEARLY SEEN ON WV IMAGES.  IN
RESPONSE TO THAT PATTERN...LISA HAS RECURVED AND IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE ON THIS GENERAL NORTHEASTWARD TRACK WITH A GRADUAL INCREASE
IN FORWARD SPEED OVER OPEN WATER THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS.
 
SINCE LISA IS MOVING NORTHEASTWARD...ON THE SAME DIRECTION OF THE
UPPER FLOW...THE RELATIVE SHEAR HAS DECREASED AND CONSEQUENTLY THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS CURRENTLY BACK UNDER THE CONVECTION. THIS
SUGGESTS THAT LISA COULD BE A LITTLE STRONGER THAN INDICATED BUT WE
WOULD RATHER WAIT TO SEE IF THE CENTER REMAINS UNDER THE OVERCAST TO
ADJUST THE INITIAL INTENSITY.  NEVERTHELESS...ONLY A SMALL
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.

11 PM EDT TUE OCT 06 1998

THE STORM CONTINUES TO BE SHEARED BY SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ASSOCIATED
WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW LOCATED NEAR 21N 53W.  SINCE LISA IS MOVING
NORTHEASTWARD...THE SHEAR IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT WOULD BE FOR A
WESTWARD-MOVING TROPICAL CYCLONE...BUT STILL STRONG ENOUGH TO
PREVENT SIGNIFICANT INTENSIFICATION.   THE UPPER LOW APPEARS TO BE
DRIFTING SOUTHEASTWARD.  IF THE UPPER LOW CONTINUES MOVING SOUTHEAST
AND LISA CONTINUES MOVING NORTHEAST...THE HIGH-LEVEL FLOW OVER THE
STORM MAY BECOME MORE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING IN A DAY OR SO. 
ON THE OTHER HAND...THE LARGE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH FARTHER TO
THE NORTH WILL PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED SHEAR LATER IN THE
PERIOD.  THE SHIPS MODEL...WHICH USES THE AVN MODEL FORECAST
WINDS...SHOWS SOME RELAXATION OF THE SHEAR DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS
AND AN INCREASE THEREAFTER.  GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES...INTENSITY IS
HELD CONSTANT IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  BY 72 HOURS LISA IS
EXPECTED TO BE COMBINING WITH A FRONTAL CYCLONE OVER THE CENTRAL
ATLANTIC...AND SHOULD BE LOSING ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS.

AS USUAL FOR THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM...WITHOUT VISIBLE SATELLITE
PICTURES...IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER.  HOWEVER THE
TPC 2-INFRARED CHANNEL COMBINATION IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE CENTER
IS VERY LIKELY NEAR THE SOUTHWEST EDGE OF THE MAIN CONVECTIVE
OVERCAST.  INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS JUST SLIGHTLY SLOWER...040/09.

A LARGE 500 MB TROUGH IS FORECAST BY THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL TO
PRODUCE A STRONG CUT-OFF LOW OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC IN A COUPLE
OF DAYS.  LISA IS EXPECTED TO BE STEERED NORTHEASTWARD TO NORTHWARD
AROUND THE EASTERN SIDE OF THIS LOW.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS

HIGHER BUT SINCE CONVECTION IS NOT VERY DEEP...WE WOULD RATHER KEEP
THE INTENSITY AT 50 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN IS BECOMING BETTER
ORGANIZED WITH BANDING FEATURES...A CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST...AND AN
EYE TRYING TO FORM.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT LISA IS CLOSE TO HURRICANE
STRENGTH.  WINDS ARE ADJUSTED TO 60 KNOTS AT THIS TIME BUT IF THE
EYE BECOMES EVIDENT...WE WILL HAVE TO INCREASE THE WINDS.  
 
LISA IS RACING NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD...ABOUT 24 KNOTS...AHEAD OF A
COLD FRONT.  MODELS SUGGEST THAT LISA SHOULD TURN MORE TO THE NORTH
AND BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG FRONTAL LOW.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST FOLLOWS THE MODELS AND MAKES LISA EXTRATROPICAL BY 36

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT WED OCT 21 1998
 
THE TROPICAL WAVE THAT HAS BEEN MOVING WESTWARD THROUGH THE ATLANTIC
AND THE CARIBBEAN DURING THE PAST WEEK HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED
AND BASED ON DATA FROM AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE...THE
SYSTEM HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  THE PLANE FOUND
A TIGHT CENTER OF 1001 MB AND MEASURED MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF
39 KNOTS INDICATING THAT THE DEPRESSION IS ALREADY NEAR TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH.  THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER APPEARS TO BE LOCATED TO THE
NORTH OF THE MAIN CONVECTION SUGGESTING THAT THE LARGE SCALE UPPER-
LEVEL WINDS ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING AT THIS
TIME.  HOWEVER...THE DEPRESSION IS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ITS OWN
OUTFLOW AS OBSERVED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY AND MOST OF THE MODELS ARE
FORMING A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN
IN ABOUT 36 HOURS...A PATTERN WHICH IS MORE CONDUCIVE FOR
STRENGTHENING.  IN ADDITION...BOTH SHIPS AND THE GFDL BRING THE
DEPRESSION TO HURRICANE STATUS BETWEEN 48 AND 72 HOURS...AND SO DOES
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.     
 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE INITIAL MOTION SINCE THE SYSTEM
JUST FORMED BUT THE BEST ESTIMATE IS 290/08.   ALL OF THE TRACK
MODELS...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CLIPER...TURN THE SYSTEM GRADUALLY
TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST AS A THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH
WEAKENS AND A STRONG MID-LATITUDE TROUGH SWINGS EASTWARD OVER THE
EASTERN UNITED STATES.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST PLACES A HURRICANE
BETWEEN SWAN ISLAND AND GRAND CAYMAN BY 72 HOURS...A POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN. 

TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE WATCHES AND WARNINGS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR
PORTIONS OF THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN AS EARLY AS THURSDAY. ALL
INTERESTS IN THIS AREA SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
SYSTEM.

5 AM EDT THU OCT 22 1998

SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST LITTLE CHANGE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  ALTHOUGH DEEP CONVECTION REMAINS
FAIRLY STRONG...THERE IS NOT MUCH EVIDENCE OF BANDING FEATURES SO
FAR.  NORTHERLY SHEAR HAS BEEN AFFECTING THE DEPRESSION...PROBABLY
DUE TO AN UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE LOCATED A FEW HUNDRED MILES TO THE
NORTHEAST.  HOWEVER...THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS AN
INCREASINGLY FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT OVER THE WESTERN
CARIBBEAN DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THEREFORE...STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE
STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME.

AN EARLIER RECON FIX SHOWED THAT THE CENTER WAS NEAR THE NORTHERN
EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THIS WAS ALSO SHOWN BY AN 85 GHZ IMAGE
FROM THE NAVAL RESEARCH LAB MONTEREY TROPICAL CYCLONE HOMEPAGE.  THE
CURRENT LOCATION IS RATHER UNCERTAIN BUT THE DEPRESSION APPEARS TO
HAVE MOVED MOSTLY WESTWARD SINCE THE LAST ADVISORY.   

A LARGE MID-LATITUDE TROUGH WILL BE SWEEPING OFF THE SOUTHEAST U.S.
COAST DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THE 06Z RUN OF THE NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB WEAKNESS EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD FROM THE
TROUGH INTO THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD...WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO TURN
TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  THIS IS SHOWN BY MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK
PREDICTION MODELS ALTHOUGH THE GFDL SHOWS A MORE NORTHWARD
TRACK...WITH A TURN BACK TO THE WEST NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD. 
THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY CLOSE TO THAT FROM THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR TO THE MEDIUM-DEPTH BAM
TRACK. 

INTERESTS IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM SINCE TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE WATCHES
AND WARNINGS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR SOME PORTION OF THE AREA LATER
TODAY.

ALTHOUGH TWO CONVECTIVE BANDS ARE SEEN ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE
TD...THE SYSTEM RETAINS AN OTHERWISE RATHER AMORPHOUS STRUCTURE AT
THIS POINT.  CENTER POSITION ESTIMATES REMAIN QUITE UNCERTAIN.  A
SHIP NEAR 12N 76W REPORTED EAST WINDS AT 12Z...BUT THE ACCURACY OF
THEIR WIND DIRECTION IS SOMEWHAT IN QUESTION ACCORDING TO THE MARINE
PREDICTION CENTER .  IF THE OBSERVATION IS VALID...THEN THE CENTER
OF CIRCULATION IS NOW LOCATED TO THE SE OF THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. 
THE REQUIRES SOME SOUTHEASTWARD RELOCATION OF THE CENTER POSITION...
AND IMPLIES LITTLE OR NO MOTION.  THE MOTION...STRUCTURE AND
INTENSITY SHOULD BE BETTER KNOWN AFTER THE HURRICANE HUNTERS ARRIVE
THERE THIS AFTERNOON.
 
THE 00Z NOGAPS AND 06Z AVN AND GFDL INDICATE THAT AFTER THE STRONG
500 MB SHORT-WAVE TROUGH PASSES BY TO THE NORTH...A RESIDUAL TROUGH
HANGS BACK NEAR THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST.  THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR SOME
NORTHWARD COMPONENT LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  IN CONTRAST...AT
850 MB...A LARGE ANTICYCLONE IS FORECAST TO PERSIST TO THE
NW...GIVING LOW LEVEL EASTERLIES.  IN COMBINATION...THIS
DISTRIBUTION YIELDS SOME SHEAR AND A LIGHT STEERING CURRENT TO THE
NW ON AVERAGE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS IS THE NHC FORECAST.  ALL
AVAILABLE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE ALSO SHOWS A NW HEADING.
 
AT UPPER LEVELS...THERE IS A COL LOCATED JUST NORTH OF THE TD...A
LITTLE SOUTH OF JAMAICA.  THE MODELS SHOW A MORE FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPING OVER THE CARIBBEAN DURING THE NEXT DAY OR
TWO.  BY THREE DAYS...HOWEVER...THE GFDL SHIFTS THE CENTER OF THE
200 MB ANTICYCLONE TO THE BAY OF CAMPECHE AND SHOWS A TROUGH OVER
THE NW CARIBBEAN.  THAT PATTERN WOULD NOT BE SO CONDUCIVE FOR
STRENGTHENING.

THE SLOW AND UNCERTAIN MOVEMENT ALLOWS/REQUIRES SOME DELAY IN

THE HURRICANE HUNTERS CONFIRMED THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE FOR THE
LOCATION OF THE CENTER OF CIRCULATION.  THE CYCLONE IS APPARENTLY
MOVING IN A SMALL CYCLONIC LOOP.  FOR NOW...IT WILL BE CONSIDERED
QUASI-STATIONARY.  THE AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERED 51 KT WINDS AT THE 1500
FT FLIGHT LEVEL.  USING THIS...THE SYSTEM IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL
STORM MITCH WITH 40 KT SURFACE WINDS.  THE CIRCULATION IS QUITE
SMALL WITH RADIUS OF MAXIMUM WINDS REPORTED TO BE 8 NM AT FLIGHT
LEVEL.
 
THE 12Z AVN RESEMBLES THE PREDECESSORS.  SECONDARY SHORT-WAVE
TROUGHS MOVING OFFSHORE FROM THE U.S. SE COAST LEAVE A WEAKNESS IN
THE HEIGHT FIELD IN THAT AREA AFTER THE INITIAL STRONG SYSTEM PASSES
OFFSHORE.  A MINOR RIDGE SETTLES IN OVER THE SE UNITED STATES.  THIS
ALLOWS FOR A SLOW NW TO NNW MOVEMENT DURING THE NEXT TWO DAYS...AS
SHOWN BY ALL TRACK GUIDANCE AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

IN CONTRAST TO THE RUN AT 06Z...THE 12Z GFDL SHOWS THE PRIMARY
FEATURES AT 200 MB LOCATED A LITTLE FARTHER TO THE EAST...WITH THE
ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE YUCATAN PENINSULA AND THE DOWNSTREAM
TROUGH AXIS A BIT TO THE EAST OF MITCH.  THIS IS A LITTLE MORE
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR INTENSIFICATION THAN FORECAST BY THAT
MODEL 6 HOURS AGO...AND COULD BE WHY IT IS SHOWING MORE
STRENGTHENING.  THE AVN HAS THIS COUPLET CENTERED EVEN FARTHER EAST
WITH THE HIGH NEAR MITCH--A VERY FAVORABLE PATTERN.  MITCH IS NOW
FORECAST TO REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH WITHIN 36 HOURS.

MITCH HAS COMPLETED A CYCLONIC LOOP IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN
AND NOW IS MOVING NORTHWARD ABOUT 5 KNOTS.  THIS GENERAL NORTHWARD
MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.  ONCE THE
MID-LATITUDE TROUGH CURRENTLY SWINGING ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED
STATES AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC MOVES OUT...A RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
DEVELOP IN THAT AREA.  THIS PATTERN SHOULD STEER MITCH ON A SLOW
NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.   MODELS RESPOND TO THAT BUILDING RIDGE AND
MOVE THE STORM NORTHERLY AND THEN NORTHWESTERLY.  THE MODELS
DISAGREE BEYOND 48 HOURS WHEN THE GFDL AND NOGAPS TURN THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE SLOWLY WESTWARD WHILE THE OTHERS CONTINUE TO SHOW A GENERAL
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK.   NEVERTHELESS...AT LONGER RANGE...ANOTHER
TROUGH IS FORECAST TO MOVE EASTWARD OVER THE UNITED STATES...AND
WILL PROBABLY FORCE MITCH TO MOVE MORE NORTHWARD AGAIN AS SUGGESTED
BY NOGAPS AND THE UK MODELS.  BOTH MODELS PLACE MITCH NEAR THE
YUCATAN CHANNEL BY DAY 5. IT APPEARS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE BUSY
FOR SEVERAL DAYS.
  
THE OUTFLOW IS GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND THE CENTER IS
UNDER DEEP CONVECTION.  MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS ARE DEVELOPING A

IMAGERY EXHIBITS WELL-DEFINED BANDING AND FAIR OUTFLOW OVER THE
NORTHERN PORTION OF THE SYSTEM.  SOUTHWESTERLY TO WESTERLY FLOW

STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE

MITCH HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE NORTHWARD THIS MORNING AND THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS 010/06 KNOTS. THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE
FOR THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A GRADUAL BEND TOWARD 
THE NORTH-NORTHWEST...THEN NORTHWEST IS FORECAST AS THE WESTERN

MITCH IS NOT STRENGTHENING AT THIS TIME.  ALTHOUGH THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION IS WELL DEFINED...THE CONVECTION IS WEAK.  UNEXPECTED
UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLY WINDS HAVE BECOME ESTABLISHED OVER THE SYSTEM
DISRUPTING THE EXCELLENT OUTFLOW WHICH WAS OBSERVED YESTERDAY.
INITIAL INTENSITY IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS IN THIS ADVISORY...BUT A
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE WILL DETERMINE IF MITCH HAS WEAKENED AS
SUSPECTED.   ALL AVAILABLE MODELS SUGGEST THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE SHOULD FORM OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN WITHIN THE NEXT
24 HOURS OR SO.  SUCH A PATTERN WOULD PROVIDE EXCELLENT CONDITIONS 
FOR STRENGTHENING AND IN FACT...BOTH SHIPS AND THE GFDL MODELS BRING
MITCH TO A 75- AND 100-KNOT HURRICANE... RESPECTIVELY.  HOWEVER...IT
IS DIFFICULT TO VISUALIZE SUCH INTENSIFICATION WITH THE PRESENT
POORLY DEFINED PATTERN OBSERVED ON SATELLITE IMAGES AND KNOWING THAT
THE GLOBAL MODELS TEND TO GET RID OF WESTERLIES TOO FAST.  AT THIS
TIME...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR NO CHANGE IN INTENSITY DURING

BEGIN. 

MITCH HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY AND LITTLE MOTION IS FORECAST

5 PM EDT FRI OCT 23 1998

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
MITCH HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE DAY. IT CONTINUES TO
HAVE WELL DEFINED CLOUD BANDS WRAPPING AROUND THE SYSTEM BUT LACKS
OF DEEP CONVECTION AND CENTRAL FEATURES.  RECON JUST MEASURED A
MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 997 MB NAD 50 KNOT WINDS.  THE WESTERLY WINDS
ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LOW WHICH FORMED JUST WEST OF THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE IS DISRUPTING THE OUTFLOW AND AS LONG THIS FEATURE IS
PRESENT STRENGTHENING IS NOT LIKELY.  UNANIMOUSLY...ALL MODELS
WEAKEN THE UPPER-LOW AND DEVELOP A SIGNIFICANT 200 MB ANTICYCLONE
OVER MITCH. HOWEVER...THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS OF WESTERLIES
RELAXING AT THIS TIME.  IF THE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE FORMS...IT
WOULD BE AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR STRENGTHENING AND IN FACT...BOTH
SHIPS AND THE GFDL MODELS BRING MITCH TO HURRICANE STATUS.  KNOWING
THAT THE GLOBAL MODELS TEND TO GET RID OF UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES TOO
FAST...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN
INTENSITY DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND IF MITCH SURVIVES...THEN
STRENGTHENING SHOULD BEGIN.

MITCH HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY OR JUST A NORTH-NORTHWEST DRIFT.  A
MID-LEVEL TROUGH LOCATED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES
IS FORECAST TO MOVE OUT OF THE AREA AND BE REPLACED BY A RIDGE. 
CONSEQUENTLY...A SLOW NORTH-NORTHWEST AND THEN NORTHWEST TRACK
SHOULD BEGIN IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE
MODELS WHICH ARE FORECASTING MITCH TO STAY OVER THE NORTHWESTERN
CARIBBEAN FOR THE NEXT 3 TO 5 DAYS.

IT APPEARS THAT SOME DEEP CONVECTION HAS RETURNED TO THE
CIRCULATION OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS AND THE TREND IS FOR THIS
CLOUDINESS TO BE GETTING A LITTLE BETTER ORGANIZED AS A CDO TYPE
AREA.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE TO UP 55 KNOTS.  THE LAST
RECON FOUND MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 50 KNOTS NORTHEAST OF THE
CENTER.  THE HRD OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS GIVES A MAX WIND OF 43 KNOTS.
THE INITIAL OFFICIAL WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST
IS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING FOLLOWING THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL AND
THE ABSENCE OF ANY OBVIOUS NEGATIVE FACTORS TO INHIBIT DEVELOPMENT. 
A REMINDER THAT INTENSITY FORECAST SKILL IS QUITE LIMITED AND
INTENSIFICATION COULD OCCUR MUCH FASTER THAN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...ESPECIALLY IF THE SHORT TERM CONVECTIVE TREND TURNS OUT
TO BE A SERIOUS ONE.
 
ALL OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW SLOW MOTION FOR 72 HOURS...MOSTLY
NORTHWESTWARD...EXCEPT THE AVIATION AND GFDL MODELS WHICH ARE
NORTHWARD FOLLOWED BY A TURN TOWARD THE WEST.  THIS SLOW MOTION IS
RELATED TO A 500 MB HIGH FORECAST TO REMAIN IN THE GULF OF MEXICO
AND BLOCK THE STORMS FORWARD MOTION.   THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE WITH A SLOW MOTION...MOSTLY NORTHWARD FOR 24
HOURS FOLLOWED BY A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  DUE TO THE SLOW
MOTION...THE NEW FORECAST TRACK IS ONLY SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY AT 12 AND 24 HOURS.  IN ANY CASE THERE APPEARS TO
BE NO THREAT TO LAND DURING THE NEXT TWO DAYS OR SO.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SAT OCT 24 1998
 
A RAGGED EYE BEGAN APPEARING INTERMITTENTLY AROUND 0415Z AND A
DVORAK CLASSIFICATION BY THE AFWA AT THAT TIME GAVE A T-NUMBER OF
4.5.  THE 06Z TAFB AND SAB ESTIMATES WERE 4.5 AND 4.0...
RESPECTIVELY.  THE HURRICANE HUNTERS ARRIVED IN THE AREA ABOUT 06Z
AND FOUND THE CENTER TO BE A LITTLE TO THE SE OF THE POSITION
INFERRED FROM SATELLITE PICTURES.  THEY ALSO FOUND HINTS OF AN EYE
...992 MB PRESSURE...AND 64 KT AT 850 MB. TWO HOURS LATER...THEY HAD
A PARTIAL EYEWALL...988 MB...AND 91 KT AT 850 MB.  BASED ON THESE
DATA...THE SURFACE WIND SPEED ESTIMATE IS INCREASED TO 80 KT.
 
MITCH HAS BEEN MOVING TOWARD 015 DEGREES AT ABOUT 5 KT OVER THE PAST
6 TO 12 HOURS.  THIS MOTION COULD HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY THE
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH DROPPING OFF THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST.  THAT
FEATURE IS FORECAST TO MOVE EASTWARD AND TO BE FOLLOWED BY RIDGING. 
THERE WAS NO 00Z RUN OF THE GFDL...BUT THE REMAINING TRACK MODELS
AND THE 18Z GFDL RESPOND TO THESE STEERING FEATURES BY SHOWING A
RATHER SHARP BEND IN THE TRACK TOWARD THE LEFT AFTER ABOUT 24 HOURS.
IN FACT...NONE OF THE DYNAMIC MODELS HAVE MITCH NORTH OF 17N BY 36
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GENERALLY FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE...BUT
MAKES THE TURN TOWARD THE WEST A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH THEN ALL BUT
ONE OF THE MODELS...ABOUT 100 NM SOUTH OF JAMAICA.  THIS MIGHT BE
CLOSE ENOUGH THAT A TROPICAL STORM WATCH...OR POSSIBLY A HURRICANE
WATCH...COULD BE NECESSARY LATER TODAY FOR THAT ISLAND.
 
WITH STRENGTHENING HAVING RESUMED...AND A FUTURE ENVIRONMENT
FAVORING ADDITIONAL INTENSIFICATION...THE WIND SPEED IS FORECAST TO
INCREASE.
 
THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED USING THE RECON DATA AND
OBSERVATIONS FROM SHIP ZCBN5.

FOR JAMAICA VERY SOON.
 
AN IMPRESSIVE CDO HAS FORMED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS IN

ADVISORY.  THERE IS ALSO A HINT OF AN EYE-TYPE FEATURE FORMING.
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE UP TO 90 KNOTS.  THE INITIAL WIND

THE HURRICANE IS MOVING 355 DEGREES AT 5 KNOTS.  DYNAMICAL MODELS
ARE DEVELOPING A VERY STRONG MID-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER
THE GULF OF MEXICO DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND CONSEQUENTLY...THE
HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO CHANGE FROM THE CURRENT NORTHWARD TRACK
TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND WEST.  IN FACT...THE LATEST GFDL MOVES
MITCH TOWARD THE WEST AND WEST-SOUTHWEST AND KEEPS IT MEANDERING
NEAR THE NORTHEASTERN TIP OF HONDURAS.  ONLY CLIPER CONTINUES TO
SHOW A NORTHWARD TRACK.   I WOULD RATHER FOLLOW STATE OF THE ART
DYNAMICAL AND GLOBAL MODELS AND FORECAST THE WESTWARD TURN. 

RECON JUST MEASURED A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 976 MB AND A DROPSONDE IN
THE EYEWALL MEASURED 93 KNOTS AT LOW LEVELS.  SATELLITE IMAGES
REVEAL THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN IS BECOMING MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED WITH
A WELL DEFINED EYE AND EXCELLENT OUTFLOW IN ALL QUADRANTS.  MODELS
DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN DEVELOPING THE 200MB ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
HURRICANE...CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS EXPECTED YESTERDAY. SHIPS AND THE
GFDL CONTINUE TO FORECAST AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR STRENGTHENING. 
THEREFORE...MITCH IS EXPECTED TO REACH AT LEAST 120 KNOTS BY 36
HOURS.

DUE TO THE CURRENT NORTHWARD MOTION...A HURRICANE WARNING HAS BEEN
ISSUED FOR JAMAICA AND A HURRICANE WATCH FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN
CUBA.  HOWEVER...DUE TO THE FORECAST NORTHWEST TURN OF THE HURRICANE
...CUBA SHOULD BE READY TO EXTEND OR SHIFT THE HURRICANE WATCH TO
CENTRAL OR WESTERN CUBA...AND THE CAYMAN ISLANDS SHOULD BE READY TO
ISSUE A WATCH OR A WARNING.  

NOTE: THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HURRICANE WHICH IS FORECAST TO
MOVE VERY SLOWLY THROUGH THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN DURING THE NEXT
SEVERAL DAYS.  THIS WOULD ALLOW SOME TIME FOR THE LONG RANGE PATTERN
TO CHANGE AND CONSEQUENTLY A FUTURE CHANGE IN THE TRACK.  INTERESTS
IN THE ENTIRE WESTERN CARIBBEAN SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THIS

SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW A VERY WELL DEFINED EYE EMBEDDED
WITHIN A COLD CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST.  HURRICANE HUNTERS RECENTLY
REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 949 MB WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT
PRESSURE DROP OF 27 MB OVER 13 HOURS.  MAX WINDS FROM A FLIGHT LEVEL
OF 10000 FEET ARE 119 KNOTS SO FAR.  SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS ARE
ESTIMATED AT 110 KNOTS.  THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW REMAINS VERY WELL
ESTABLISHED...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR ADDITIONAL
STRENGTHENING.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST SHIPS AND GFDL
GUIDANCE.

THE NOAA JET FLEW IN THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE HURRICANE YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND FOUND A NARROW MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF MITCH.  THIS RIDGE HAS TURNED THE HURRICANE MORE TOWARD THE
WEST-NORTHWEST...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 295/06. 
HOWEVER...MOST MODELS WEAKEN THIS RIDGE WITH TIME.  NEAR THE END OF
THIS FORECAST PERIOD A 500 MB ANTICYCLONE SHOULD BE CENTERED OVER
THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND A BROAD TROUGH SHOULD PERSIST OVER
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...BUT THESE FEATURES APPEAR TO BE TOO FAR AWAY
FROM THE HURRICANE TO PRODUCE ANY WELL-DEFINED STEERING FOR MITCH.
WEAK STEERING CURRENTS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN
AND WE COULD SEE SOME MEANDERING OF THE HURRICANE IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS.  CURRENT TRACK CONTINUES THE GENERAL MOTION TOWARD THE WEST
NORTHWEST BUT WITH A DECREASE IN THE FORWARD SPEED.  THE GFDL AND
UKMET MODELS BOTH PRACTICALLY STALL THE HURRICANE AFTER 36 HOURS
...WHILE THE NAVY NOGAPS CONTINUES A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION TOWARD THE
NORTH COAST OF HONDURAS.

NOTE: THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HURRICANE WHICH IS FORECAST TO

BUT ANOTHER PLANE IS DUE TO MAKE A CENTER FIX AROUND 05Z...AND WE
SHALL SEE IF MITCH HAS STRENGTHENED EVEN MORE.  SINCE THE SHEAR IS
WEAK AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE WARMER THAN 29 DEG C OVER THE
AREA...SOME ADDITIONAL INTENSIFICATION COULD TAKE PLACE.
 
THE EYE HAS WOBBLED A BIT TO THE LEFT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS
BUT CURRENT MOVEMENT IS ESTIMATED TO BE WESTWARD AROUND 7 KNOTS.
STEERING CURRENTS ARE NOT WELL-DEFINED.  ONE KEY FACTOR FOR THE
STEERING OF MITCH DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS IS HOW MUCH MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGING THERE WILL BE TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE.
TRACK PREDICTION MODELS ARE GIVING A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS...BUT THE
LATEST GLOBAL MODEL RUNS SHOW THE 500 MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF MITCH
WEAKENING SOMEWHAT DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS IS ALSO
INDICATED BY THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN WHICH SHOWS A MORE
NORTHWARD...BUT SLOW...MOTION DEVELOPING SOON.   A NORTHWARD TURN IS
ALSO SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...BUT LATER IN THE PERIOD. 
REGARDLESS...THIS TRACK STILL KEEPS MITCH OVER THE NORTHWEST
CARIBBEAN FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS.
 
DUE TO THE CURRENT WESTWARD TRACK...HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE
RECOMMENDED FOR THE NORTHEASTERN COAST OF HONDURAS.  IT WAS NOT
POSSIBLE TO COORDINATE THESE WARNINGS WITH THE METEOROLOGICAL
SERVICE OF THAT COUNTRY DUE TO COMMUNICATIONS DIFFICULTIES.

U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVES REPORTED A 10 NMI DIAMETER EYE WITH A
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 923 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A
SYMMETRIC HURRICANE WITH A WELL DEFINED EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN VERY
COLD CONVECTIVE TOPS.  SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS ARE STILL ESTIMATED
AT 130 KNOTS.  THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN IS WELL ESTABLISHED
AND SOME FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS STILL POSSIBLE TODAY.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS GENERALLY TOWARD THE WEST.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND CONTINUES TO
BE A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS.  THE STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF THE HURRICANE AND HOW THIS CHANGES WITH TIME IS CRUCIAL.
THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL INDICATES A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION AS DOES
THE UKMET MODEL.  THE GFDL AND AVIATION MODELS SHOW THE RIDGE
WEAKENING AND INDICATE A MORE NORTHWARD...BUT SLOW...TRACK.  IN ANY
CASE...THE MOTION FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS IS EXPECTED TO BE SLOW
WHICH LEAVES THE HURRICANE OVER THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/07...NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM THE LAST
ADVISORY.  THE 06Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE HURRICANE MEANDERING
NORTH AND THEN NORTHEASTWARD FOR 72 HOURS.  ALL OF THE TRACK MODELS
SHOW VERY LITTLE MOTION AS A HIGH OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO DRIFTS 
SOUTHWESTWARD AND BLOCKS THE HURRICANE.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
DRIFTS THE HURRICANE SLOWLY WESTWARD AND THEN NORTHWARD...BUT SUCH
SLOW FORWARD SPEED MAKES THE DIRECTION OF MOTION HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.

THE MAXIMUM 1-MIN SURFACE WIND IS INCREASED TO 135 KNOTS BASED ON
7.0 TO 7.5 DVORAK T NUMBERS.  THIS IS STILL A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE
OF THE WIND SPEED.  A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST AFTER 24 HOURS
FOLLOWING THE SHIPS STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL WHICH
INDICATES THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY FOR A TROPICAL CYCLONE TO
MAINTAIN 135 KT WINDS FOR 72 HOURS. 

I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONTACT BELIZE OR HONDURAS FOR THIS ADVISORY. 
IT MAY SOON BE TIME TO CONSIDER A HURRICANE WATCH FOR BELIZE AND THE
REMAINDER OF THE NORTH COAST OF HONDURAS.

MITCH CONTINUES TO INTENSIFY.  THE LATEST RECON CENTRAL PRESSURE IS
906 MB.  A WIND SPEED OF 173 KNOTS WAS MEASURED FROM A GPS
DROPSONDE AT 500 FT AT ABOUT 1900Z.  THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO
155 KNOTS AT 21Z ON THIS BASIS.  THIS MAY BE THE STRONGEST ATLANTIC
BASIN HURRICANE IN RECENT YEARS TO BE OBSERVED AS LATE AS OCTOBER
26.  IT IS CLIMATOLOGICALLY UNLIKELY FOR THIS STRENGTH TO PERSIST
AND A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS...BUT
MITCH IS EXPECTED STILL BE A VERY DANGEROUS HURRICANE IN THREE DAYS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/07.  ONCE AGAIN THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE SLOW MOTION WITH A 500 MB HIGH PERSISTING
OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO.  THE GFDL MEANDERS THE HURRICANE
NORTHWARD AND SHOWS A POSITION STILL IN THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN IN
FIVE (5) DAYS.  THE NOGAPS SHOWS A SLOW TURN TOWARD THE NORTH IN
THREE DAYS AND THE UKMET SHOWS A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION...REACHING
BELIZE OR MEXICO IN THREE DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND OF
THE ABOVE MODELS SHOWING VERY SLOW MOTION FOR 72 HOURS WITH A TURN
TO THE NORTH.
 
IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHICH COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES IN THE NORTHWEST
CARIBBEAN ARE MOST THREATENED.  THE PROXIMITY OF THE HURRICANE TO
HONDURAS MOTIVATED THE GOVERNMENT OF HONDURAS TO ISSUE A HURRICANE
WARNING FOR ALL OF THEIR COASTLINE.

THE EYE CONTINUES TO BE EXTREMELY WELL-DEFINED AND THE UPPER-
TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW REMAINS VERY IMPRESSIVE.  LATEST DVORAK
CLASSIFICATIONS FROM SAB IN WASHINGTON AND THE TPC CONTINUE TO
SUPPORT A CURRENT INTENSITY OF 155 KNOTS...HOWEVER THERE HAS BEEN
SOME EROSION OF THE COLD CLOUD TOPS OVER THE NORTHWEST SEMICIRCLE OF
THE HURRICANE...WHICH IS BELIEVED TO BE A TEMPORARY CONDITION.  IT
IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR HURRICANES TO MAINTAIN SUCH GREAT INTENSITY FOR
VERY LONG...BUT HURRICANES SUCH AS THESE ARE RARE EVENTS THEMSELVES.

MITCH WILL LIKELY REMAIN AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HURRICANE FOR AT
LEAST A DAY OR TWO.  THE MAIN FACTOR GOVERNING WHETHER MITCH WILL
MAINTAIN SUCH INTENSITY...OTHER THAN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES
WHICH CAN CAUSE SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS...IS INCREASED VERTICAL
SHEAR.  THIS SHEAR MAY BE PRODUCED BY STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL
WESTERLIES TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE...WHICH COULD EVENTUALLY
IMPINGE ON MITCH.

MOTION CONTINUES TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST.  OUR TRACK PREDICTION
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO BE ANYTHING BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD.  THE 500 MB
HIGH OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH MITCH ON A
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TO WESTWARD PATH TOWARD BELIZE OR YUCATAN...AND
THIS IS SHOWN BY THE BETA/ADVECTION MODELS AND THE U.K. MET. OFFICE
GLOBAL MODEL.  ON THE OTHER HAND THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...NOGAPS...
AND THE BAROTROPIC MODEL SHOW A TURN TO THE NORTH IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS.  THE LATTER TRACK IS CONSISTENT WITH A SUBTLE WESTWARD SHIFT
OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED RIDGE IN THE MODEL FORECAST...WHICH COULD
LEAVE A SLIGHT OPENING TO THE NORTH OF MITCH.  THE LATEST GFDL RUN
SHOWS A SLOW MEANDERING MOTION DEVELOPING IN 12 TO 24 HOURS...AND
PERSISTING THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST...LIKE THE
PREVIOUS ONE...SHOWS A SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED IN 12 HOURS OR
SO WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  THE
LONGER-TERM MOVEMENT OF MITCH REMAINS SHROUDED IN UNCERTAINTY.

IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT...BASED ON THE 905 MB CENTRAL
PRESSURE MEASURED FROM THE AIRCRAFT EARLIER TODAY...MITCH IS TIED AS
THE FOURTH STRONGEST HURRICANE OBSERVED IN THE ATLANTIC BASIN.  HERE
ARE THE RANKINGS:

GILBERT (1988)...888 MB

...CORRECTION TO 4TH PARAGRAPH...
 
THE LATEST DATA FROM THE U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF MITCH HAS
RISEN A BIT THIS MORNING...UP TO 917 MB. HOWEVER...THE DROPSONDE
RECORDED 164 KNOTS AT 900 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO DEPICT
A REMARKABLY WELL-DEFINED EYE AND IMPRESSIVE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW.
AS SUSPECTED EARLIER THE EROSION OF THE COLD CLOUD TOPS WITHIN THE
NORTHWEST SEMICIRCLE OF THE HURRICANE WAS TEMPORARY. IN FACT...THE
CLOUD CANOPY SURROUNDING THE EYE HAS EXPANDED AND COOLED...WITH
TOPS TO -80 DEG C IN ALL QUADRANTS.  THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY
WILL BE HELD AT 155 KNOTS...ALSO SUPPORTED BY TAFB AND SAB DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES. AS MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR
HURRICANES TO REACH...AND MAINTAIN...SUCH GREAT INTENSITY FOR VERY
LONG...BUT HURRICANES SUCH AS THESE ARE RARE EVENTS THEMSELVES.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
MAINTAINING MITCH AS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HURRICANE FOR AT LEAST
A DAY OR TWO.  THE MAIN FACTOR GOVERNING WHETHER MITCH WILL MAINTAIN
SUCH INTENSITY...OTHER THAN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES WHICH CAN
CAUSE SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS...IS INCREASED VERTICAL SHEAR.  THIS
SHEAR MAY BE PRODUCED BY STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES TO THE
NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE...WHICH COULD EVENTUALLY IMPINGE ON
MITCH.
 
RECONNAISSANCE FIXES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS SUGGEST MITCH IS
MOVING ALMOST DUE WEST...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW
270/07 KNOTS.  THE 00Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY
MORE FOCUSED ON A MORE WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE THROUGH 36
HOURS OR SO SUGGESTING THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
GULF OF MEXICO COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH MITCH TOWARD BELIZE OR
YUCATAN. THEREAFTER...SEVERAL MODELS...NOTABLY LBAR AND THE GFDL...
TURN THE HURRICANE NORTHWEST TO NORTH BETWEEN 48 AND 72 HOURS IN
RESPONSE TO THE WESTWARD SHIFT OF THE 500 MB ANTICYCLONE MENTIONED
ABOVE.  MEANWHILE THE AVIATION AND BETA/ADVECTION MODELS...CONTINUE
A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS IMPLYING THAT THE RIDGE
HOLDS IN.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST CONTINUES A GENERAL WESTWARD
HEADING THROUGH 12 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL SLOWING IN FORWARD SPEED
AND BEND TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST THEN NORTHWEST THEREAFTER.  THIS
REPRESENTS A MODEST LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
ALTHOUGH THE OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS MITCH OFFSHORE THE CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO THE COAST...COUPLED WITH OUR HISTORICAL 24-HOUR TRACK
ERRORS AND THE STRENGTH OF THIS HURRICANE...WARRANTS STRONG 
CONSIDERATION OF UPGRADING THE HURRICANE WATCHES FOR THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA AND BELIZE TO HURRICANE WARNINGS.  THE RESPECTIVE
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN CONTACTED...AND THE WATCHES WILL LIKELY
BE REPLACED WITH HURRICANE WARNINGS AT 0900 UTC.  MEXICO AND
GUATAMALA HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND WE ARE AWAITING WORD BACK FROM
BELIZE.
 
THE LAST OCTOBER CAT 4/5 HURRICANE IN THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN WAS
HURRICANE HATTI IN 1961 WHICH REACHED AN ESTIMATED MINIMUM CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 924 MB ON THE 30TH.

MOTION.  THE GFDL IS ALMOST STATIONARY FOR 72 HOURS AND THE NOGAPS
SHOWS A SLOW MOSTLY NORTHWARD DRIFT.   THE LBAR SHOWS A NORTHWEST
DRIFT.  THE UKMET IS FASTER THAN THE OTHERS AND MOVES THE HURRICANE
WESTWARD ACROSS BELIZE IN 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK
FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWING A SLOW WEST TO
NORTHWESTWARD DRIFT FOR 72 HOURS TO NEAR THE YUCATAN PENINSULA.  IT
WOULD ONLY TAKE A 5 KNOT ERROR IN THE FORECAST SPEED OF MOTION FOR
THE HURRICANE TO MAKE LANDFALL IN 24 TO 36 HOURS ANYWHERE IN THE
WARNING AREA FROM HONDURAS TO THE YUCATAN.

THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED 10 KNOTS BASED ON THE RAGGEDNESS OF THE
DEEPEST  CONVECTION COMPARED TO EARLIER...ALONG WITH THE 06Z RECON
DATA WHICH SHOWED THE CENTRAL PRESSURE UP 12 MB AND SOMEWHAT WEAKER
FLIGHT LEVEL WIND SPEEDS.  THE FORECAST IS FOR THE WINDS TO
GRADUALLY DECREASE TO 115 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS...BASED ON THE SHIPS

THE EYE IS BECOMING LESS DISTINCT ON SATELLITE IMAGES...AND CENTRAL
PRESSURE REPORTS FROM THE AIR FORCE AND NOAA PLANES SHOW A STEADY
RISE.  THIS INDICATES THAT MITCH HAS BEEN GRADUALLY WEAKENING. 
HOWEVER...DROPWINDSONDE DATA STILL SHOW HIGH WIND SPEEDS WHICH
SUPPORT CATEGORY FOUR STRENGTH.  THE PROXIMITY TO THE LANDMASS OF
HONDURAS...CUTTING OFF THE LOW-LEVEL INFLOW FROM THE SOUTH...HAS
PROBABLY BEEN THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE WEAKENING.  VERTICAL SHEAR
APPEARS TO BE LIGHT OVER THE AREA AND IF THE CORE OF THE HURRICANE
REMAINS OVER WATER AS FORECAST MITCH WILL LIKELY REMAIN A FORMIDABLE
HURRICANE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS.

THE EYE HAS EXHIBITED LITTLE OVERALL MOVEMENT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
HOURS.  THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS HAVE BEEN VERY INCONSISTENT WITH
THIS SYSTEM.  FOR EXAMPLE...THE GFDL MODEL HAS VACILLATED FROM RUN
TO RUN AS TO WHETHER MITCH WILL MOVE GENERALLY WESTWARD...OR DRIFT
SLOWLY TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE LATEST SUITE OF OBJECTIVE TRACK
FORECASTS SHOW A MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION DEVELOPING...HOWEVER THE
U.K. MET OFFICE MODEL INDICATES A MAINLY WESTWARD TRACK.  IT
SUFFICES TO SAY THAT THE STEERING FLOW REMAINS ILL-DEFINED.  THE
CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
ONE...HOWEVER INTERESTS IN THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN SHOULD BEAR IN
MIND THAT THESE FORECASTS ARE UNCERTAIN AND THAT THE DANGEROUS
AFFECTS OF THIS HURRICANE COVER A SIZEABLE AREA.  

ALTHOUGH THE STORM SURGE...WAVES...AND HIGH WINDS ARE VERY
DANGEROUS...RAINFALL FROM THIS SLOW-MOVING SYSTEM IS PARTICULARLY
LIFE-THREATENING.  FIFI...A CATEGORY 2 HURRICANE IN 1974 WHICH MOVED

HURRICANE MITCH DISCUSSION NUMBER  27
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST WED OCT 28 1998
 
MITCH HAS BEEN MEANDERING THIS MORNING BETWEEN THE ISLAND OF GUANAJA
AND THE NORTH COAST OF HONDURAS.  THE LATEST FIX FROM THE U.S. AIR
FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT WAS A FEW TENTHS SOUTH OF
OUR 03Z POSITION...WITH SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB
AND SAB IN CLOSE AGREEMENT.  THE HURRICANE MAY BE IN THE PROCESS OF
MAKING A CYCLONIC LOOP.  WITH THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE CURRENT MOTION
MITCH WILL BE HELD STATIONARY WITH A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION EXPECTED
TO BEGIN LATER TODAY.
 
THE EYE HAS CONTINUED TO LOSE DEFINITION IN SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE
LATEST CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED FROM THE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT 
IS 941 MB...UP 8 MB SINCE THE LAST PENETRATION AROUND 00Z. THE RECON
MESSAGE ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE EYE WAS FILLING IN. THUS...THE
WEAKENING TREND HAS CONTINUED.  THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND
REPORTED WAS 120 KNOTS.  HOWEVER...AS WAS THE CASE IN EARLIER
MISSIONS THE DROPWINDSONDE DATA SHOW HIGHER WIND SPEEDS NEAR THE
SURFACE.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS NOW 115 KNOTS...MINIMUM CATEGORY
FOUR STATUS. THE PROXIMITY OF THE HURRICANE TO THE LANDMASS OF
HONDURAS...SERVING TO CUT OFF THE LOW-LEVEL INFLOW FROM THE SOUTH...
HAS PROBABLY BEEN THE PRIMARY CULPRIT BEHIND MITCH/S WEAKENING. WITH
A WEAK VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ENVIRONMENT AND THE ANTICIPATION OF THE
RESUMPTION OF A WESTWARD MOTION...WHICH WOULD BRING THE CORE OF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE BACK OVER WATER...MITCH IS FORECAST TO REMAIN A
FORMIDABLE HURRICANE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
 
THE 00Z GLOBAL MODELS OFFER LITTLE TO HELP RESOLVE THE STEERING
ENVIRONMENT. THE 06Z TRACK MODELS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THEIR 00Z
COUNTERPARTS DISPLAYING CONSIDERABLE SCATTER. THE SOLUTIONS VARY

WHILE MOST OF THE MODELS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE FORECAST
A WESTWARD MOTION AND LANDFALL ON THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...MITCH HAS
MOVED VERY LITTLE...IN FACT LESS THAN 40 NM IN THE PAST 18 HOURS.
THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO CAMPS OF FUTURE TRACKS.  THE FIRST INCLUDES
THE MODEL THAT HAS PERFORMED THE BEST SO FAR...NOGAPS.  THE NOGAPS
HAS PERSISTENTLY INDICATED AN EVENTUAL NORTHWARD MOVEMENT...WHEN ITS
REPRESENTATION OF THE LONGWAVE RIDGE AXIS WELL TO THE NORTHWEST
SHIFTS EASTWARD OF MITCH/S LONGITUDE IN 48 TO 72 HOURS.  THE MOST
RECENT GFDL...LBAR AND BAMD ARE NOW SIMILAR TO NOGAPS.  THE
REMAINING GUIDANCE IS TOWARD THE WNW TO NW.  IN DEFERENCE TO THE
FIRST GROUP...THE OFFICIAL TRACK SHIFTS THE THREE DAY POSITION A
LITTLE TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THIS IS A
SUBTLE BUT POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR THE U.S. GULF COAST--
MITCH WILL CONTINUE BATTERING PORTIONS OF THE NW CARIBBEAN FOR THE
NEXT 3 DAYS...AND COULD POSE A THREAT TO THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION
AFTER THAT.
 
CLOUD TOPS CONTINUE TO SLOWLY WARM...BUT NO CHANGE IS MADE TO THE
CURRENT INTENSITY.  A CONTINUED INTERACTION OF THE CIRCULATION WITH
LAND COULD RESULT IN FURTHER WEAKENING.  PERHAPS UPWELLING WILL LEAD
TO SOME WEAKENING AS WELL.  IF MITCH BEGINS TO MOVE NORTHWARD THEN
THE WEAKENING TREND WOULD LIKELY BE ARRESTED AND EVEN SOME
RE-INTENSIFICATION COULD OCCUR.
 
THE RECON DATA SHOW A PAIR OF WIND MAXIMA IN THE NORTHERN
SEMICIRCLE.  THE RADII FOR 64 KT AND 50 KT HAVE BEEN INCREASED TO
COVER THE OUTERMOST LOCATION OF THESE SPEEDS.
 
VERY DANGEROUS STORM SURGE...WAVES...AND HIGH WINDS WILL CONTINUE
OVER PORTIONS OF HONDURAS AND ADJACENT ISLANDS.  RAINFALL FROM THIS
SLOW-MOVING HURRICANE WILL ALSO BE A MAJOR THREAT...PRODUCING
LIFE-THREATENING FLASH FLOODS AND MUD SLIDES.

MITCH HAS DRIFTED TOWARD THE WEST OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS...
AND THIS RUN OF THE BAM SUGGEST THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE.  ALTHOUGH A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH OR TWO WILL BE PASSING WELL TO THE NORTH OF MITCH
DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO...MUCH OF THE REMAINING 12Z GUIDANCE
AGAIN SUGGESTS THAT NO SIGNIFICANT MOTION WILL OCCUR UNTIL THE
LONGWAVE RIDGE TO THE NW MOVES EAST OF MITCH/S LONGITUDE.  THE
NOGAPS SHOWS THIS OCCURRING IN ABOUT 72 HOURS.  THE GFDL HAS A
SIMILAR BUT DELAYED PATTERN EVOLUTION...WHILE THE AVN IS A LITTLE
SLOWER YET.  AS A RESULT...THE NOGAPS ENDS UP IN 72 HOURS IN THE
YUCATAN CHANNEL WHILE THE AVN IS NEAR THE NW TIP OF THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA.  THE NHC TRACK IS BETWEEN THESE TWO...AND VERY NEAR OUR
PREVIOUS TRACK AND THE CURRENT GFDL.
 
THE WEAKENING TREND HAS CONTINUED WITH THE CENTRAL PRESSURE NOW UP
TO 960 MB.  THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS ESTIMATED AT 100 KT.  THE
HURRICANE HAS LIKELY WEAKENED FROM A COMBINATION OF INTERACTION WITH
LAND...UPWELLED COOLER WATERS...AND A POSSIBLE EYEWALL REPLACEMENT
CYCLE AS INFERRED FROM THE DOUBLE WIND MAXIMA NOTED THIS MORNING. 
FURTHER WEAKENING WILL BE SHOWN UNTIL THE SYSTEM STARTS TO MOVE.

HURRICANE MITCH DISCUSSION NUMBER  30
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 PM EST WED OCT 28 1998

MITCH HAS BEEN STAGNATED NEAR THE BAY ISLANDS AND WILL LIKELY REMAIN
SO THROUGH TONIGHT.  THE CONTINUED INTERACTION OF THE SOUTHERN
PORTION OF ITS CIRCULATION WITH HONDURAS AND UPWELLING OF COOLER
SHELF WATERS NEAR THE COAST HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A STEADY WEAKENING.
LAST AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE OBSERVATIONS SHOWED A BREAKDOWN OF THE
EYEWALL STRUCTURE.  SOME FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY IF THE SYSTEM
REMAINS QUASI-STATIONARY...BUT IF THE CENTER MOVES BACK OVER OPEN
WATERS...RE-STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR.  

VERY LITTLE CHANGE IS MADE TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST. 
NUMERICAL GUIDANCE MODELS CONTINUE TO BE DIVERSE.  THE NOGAPS MODEL
SHOWS A MOSTLY NORTHWARD MOTION DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD...BUT
OTHER MODELS PREDICT A NORTHWESTWARD TO WESTWARD TRACK.  THE LATEST
NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS VERY LITTLE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE
500 MB LONGWAVE RIDGE THAT IS CURRENTLY OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO
DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  HOWEVER THIS MODEL DOES SHOW THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE TO THE EAST OF MITCH
IN 2-3 DAYS.  THIS COULD RESULT IN A MORE NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF
MOTION.  

BEYOND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST PERIOD...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AT 500 MB
MAY BREAK DOWN THE GULF RIDGE AND COULD STEER MITCH TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST...BUT THIS IS UNCERTAIN.    
 
STORM SURGE...WAVES...AND HIGH WINDS WILL CONTINUE OVER PORTIONS OF
HONDURAS AND ADJACENT ISLANDS.  LARGE AND DANGEROUS WAVES ARE ALSO
IMPACTING OTHER COASTAL LOCATIONS IN THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA. 
RAINFALL FROM THIS SLOW-MOVING HURRICANE IS ALSO A MAJOR THREAT...
PRODUCING LIFE-THREATENING FLASH FLOODS AND MUD SLIDES.

THE LATEST CENTER FIX FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT PLACES THE CENTER OF MITCH ON THE CAPE OF HONDURAS.
BASED ON THE LAST 12 HOURS OF RECON FIXES THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN
DRIFTING SOUTHWARD AND MAYBE DOING ANOTHER CYCLONIC LOOP.  MITCH
WILL BE HELD QUASI-STATIONARY INITIALLY...WITH A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST
MOTION FORECAST BY 12 HOURS.
 
RECON DATA SHOWS THAT MITCH HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN WITH THE CENTRAL
PRESSURE NOW UP TO 979 MB...A 41 MB RISE IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.  THE
DROPWINDSONDE DATA SHOWS 74 KNOTS AT 922 MB.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY
WILL BE REDUCED TO 75 KNOTS.  FURTHER WEAKENING IS POSSIBLE IF THE
CIRCULATION REMAINS ON THE COAST OR DRIFTS FARTHER INLAND...BUT IF
THE CENTER MOVES BACK OVER OPEN WATERS AS FORECAST RE-STRENGTHENING
COULD OCCUR.
 
ALTHOUGH THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS CONTINUE TO DISPLAY SOME
SCATTER A FAIR NUMBER HAVE REACHED A CONSENSUS ON A GENERAL
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CLIPER...ALL THE MODELS
BRING MITCH INLAND EITHER OVER BELIZE OR THE YUCATAN PENINSULA.
THE NOGAPS MODEL...WHICH HAD A NORTHWARD HEADING AT 00Z...NOW SHOWS
A MOSTLY NORTHWESTWARD MOTION DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD BRINGING
THE HURRICANE INTO NORTHERN BELIZE AFTER 48 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST IS SLIGHT LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BUT MAINTAINS
THE SLOW FORWARD SPEED. THE 00Z RUNS OF THE NCEP AND NOGAPS GLOBAL
MODELS SHOW A MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH FORMING EAST OF MITCH IN THE
NEXT 48-72 HOURS.  THIS MAY IMPART A MORE NORTHERLY MOTION LATER 
IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT IN INDICATING A SLOW NW MOTION...AS NOTED 6

DAYS. THE OFFICIAL TRACK REFLECTS THIS...BRINGING MITCH TO NEAR THE
EAST COAST OF THE YUCATAN OR BELIZE IN ABOUT TWO DAYS.  THE GFDL IS
THE OUTLIER THIS MORNING...SHOWING LITTLE MOVEMENT FOR ANOTHER 3
DAYS.  THE LONGER TERM TRACK REMAINS EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN WITH THE
00Z NOGAPS AND MRF SHOWING AN EVENTUAL BREAKDOWN OF THE LARGE SCALE
PATTERN TO THE NORTH ALLOWING MITCH TO THEN MOVE TOWARD THE NORTH
AND MAYBE THE NORTHEAST.
 
THE HIGHEST FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS ON THE EARLY MORNING RECON MISSION
WERE 72 KT.  THE PRESSURE WAS THEN UP TO 987 MB.  INITIAL WIND SPEED
IS ESTIMATED AT 65 KT.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MITCH WILL WEAKEN BELOW
HURRICANE STRENGTH LATER TODAY...BUT IF IT BEGINS TO MOVE AS

ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.  ON THE BASIS THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE WILL BE SET AT 255/03 KNOTS.

NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THIS IS LIKELY
IN RESPONSE TO THE AVIATION AND NOGAPS GLOBAL MODELS DEVELOPMENT OF 
A MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE EAST OF THE MITCH.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE THROUGH 12 HOURS
FOLLOWED BY A GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING THEREAFTER.  THIS TRACK IS
SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.   

THE CENTER OF MITCH REMAINS OVER LAND AND THE CIRCULATION CONTINUES

AND IS INLAND OVER HONDURAS.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 240/02.
ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST TO
NORTHWESTWARD DRIFT FOR 72 HOURS.  THIS IS THE RESULT OF A DEEP-

ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECENT SURFACE OBSERVATIONS OVER WATER TO KNOW
WHETHER MITCH IS STILL OF STORM STRENGTH.  AN AIRCRAFT WILL
INVESTIGATE THIS AFTERNOON TO DETERMINE THE WIND SPEEDS.  MEANWHILE
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL LEAVE THE WIND SPEED AT 35 KNOTS FOR 72

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 240/03.  THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS
THE HIGH IN THE GULF OF MEXICO BEING ERODED BY A SHORT WAVE TROUGH
IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS.  THIS IS THE BASIS FOR A SLOW NORTHWARD
COMPONENT OF MOTION SHOWN BY THE GFDL...NOGAPS...AND AVIATION
MODELS.  THE UKMET SHOWS MORE OF A NORTHWESTWARD MOTION.  THE
OFFICAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO...AND AN UPDATE OF...THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
THE CONVECTION IN THE MAIN BANDING FEATURE HAS BEEN DECREASING.
HOWEVER A RECENT REPORT OF 49 KNOTS FROM ROATAN REQUIRES THAT THE
WIND SPEED BE INCREASED BACK UP TO 50 KNOTS.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN
THAT A STRENGTENING TREND IS OCCURRING...BUT IT MEANS THAT OUR
PREVIOUS ESTIMATES WERE TOO LOW??  AN EVEN HIGHER OBSERVATION OF
70 KNOTS FROM PUERTO BARRIOS IS BELIEVED TO BE A RESULT OF A
FUNNELING EFFECT FROM NEARBY MOUNTAINS.  EXCEPT FOR THIS ADJUSTMENT
OF WIND SPEED...MITCH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WEAKENING AS MOST OF
THE CIRCULATION IS FORECAST TO REMAIN OVER LAND.
 
HEAVY RAINFALL OVER HONDURAS...NICARAGUA...GUATEMALA...BELIZE...AND
PORTIONS OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA CONTINUES TO BE THE PRIMARY

10 PM EST FRI OCT 30 1998
 
WHILE THE CIRCULATION CENTER IS DEVOID OF THUNDERSTORMS...MITCH
CONTINUES TO PRODUCE INTENSE CONVECTION PRIMARILY NEAR THE PACIFIC
BORDER AREA OF HONDURAS AND NICARAGUA.  IN THAT AREA...CLOUD TOP
TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS -90C HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY GOES SATELLITE AND
IMPLY THAT TORRENTIAL RAINS CONTINUE.  WINDS REMAIN LOCALLY STRONG
ALONG THE HONDURAS CARIBBEAN COAST...WITH 45-50 KT NOTED EARLIER
THIS EVENING AT ROATAN.

SURFACE DATA AND SATELLITE PICTURES SUGGEST THAT THE SURFACE CENTER
IS NOW OVER CENTRAL HONDURAS AND MOVING TOWARD ABOUT 250 DEGREES
NEAR 6 KT.  WHILE NUMERICAL MODELS HAVE SHOWN AN EVENTUAL BREAKDOWN
IN THE HIGH TO THE NORTH FOR SOME DAYS...THE 18Z AVN NOW INDICATES
THAT CHANGE SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.  IF CORRECT
...AND IF MITCH SURVIVES THAT LONG...THEN MITCH COULD BE PULLED
TOWARD THE NW OR NORTH.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS BASED ON THAT
PROGRESSION AND IS SIMILAR TO THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE.
 
HEAVY RAINFALL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODS ARE LIKELY TO PERSIST
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 24 TO 48 HOURS OVER PORTIONS OF HONDURAS...
NICARAGUA...GUATEMALA...BELIZE...EL SALVADOR...AND THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA.
 
THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY THAT TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS COULD
EVENTUALLY BE REQUIRED FOR THE PACIFIC COAST OF SOME OF THE ABOVE
MENTIONED AREAS.

THE CENTER IS POORLY DEFINED OVER THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF
HONDURAS AND DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON INFRARED IMAGES.  THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS 245/06.  THERER ARE NO IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE
TRACK GUIDANCE.  THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE 500 MB HIGH IN THE
GULF OF MEXICO BEING REPLACE BY WESTERLIES DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS
AND MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A SLOW MOTION FOR 72
HOURS WITH A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND THE GFDL MODEL SHOWING A SLOW
NORTHWARD TURN.
 
MOST OF THE CONVECTION IS GONE FROM OVER THE WATER NORTH OF HONDURAS
AND THE WINDS SPEEDS SHOULD BE DECREASING THERE.  A HUGE AREA OF
DEEP CONVECTION PERSISTS TO THE SOUTH OF THE CENTER AND EXTENDS 
OVER EASTERN PACIFIC WATERS.
 
HEAVY RAINFALL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODS ARE LIKELY TO PERSIST
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 24 TO 48 HOURS OVER PORTIONS OF HONDURAS...
NICARAGUA...GUATEMALA...AND EL SALVADOR.
 
EVEN THOUGH IS IS NOT PART OF THE FORECAST...THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
THAT THE CENTER COULD MOVE OR REFORM OVER PACIFIC WATERS...REQUIRING
TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS FOR THE PACIFIC COAST OF CENTRAL AMERICA.

12Z SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM WESTERN HONDURAS SUGGEST THAT THE
CENTER OF MITCH IS POSITIONED A BIT FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS
THOUGHT...SATELLITE-BASED FIXES ALSO SUPPORT THIS ALTHOUGH THE
CIRCULATION CENTER IS BY NO MEANS WELL-DEFINED.  THERE HAVE NOT
BEEN ANY REPORTS OF 34 KNOT WINDS FOR THE LAST 12 HOURS AND LAND
OBSERVATIONS INDICATE 10-20 KNOT WINDS.  THUS...MITCH IS BEING
DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS NOW 30 KNOTS.  THE GOVERNMENTS OF MEXICO...BELIZE...
GUATEMALA HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND ARE DISCONTINUING THE TROPICAL
STORM WARNINGS FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE COASTLINES.  WE HAVE BEEN
UNABLE TO CONTACT HONDURAS BUT EXPECT THEY WILL CONCUR.
 
BASED ON THE POSITION ESTIMATE THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 270/06
KNOTS. THE NCEP GLOBAL MODELS SHOW THE MID-LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE
GULF OF MEXICO BREAKING DOWN DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS AS A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST U.S. THE NHC TRACK 
CALLS FOR A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 36 HOURS
FOLLOWED BY A MORE NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72 HOURS..IN CLOSEST
AGREEMENT WITH THE UKMET AND THE GFDL GUIDANCE.  THE TRACK HAS THE
SYSTEM MOVING OVER THE MOST MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF GUATEMALA...WITH
PEAKS OF 8000-13000 FT.  THUS...THE SYSTEM MAY NOT SURVIVE AS LONG
AS FORECAST.

MITCH CONTINUES TO UP IN MOISTURE FROM THE EAST PACIFIC HELPING 
FUEL SOME DEEP CONVECTION MAINLY WEST OF THE CENTER.  THE STRONGEST
CONVECTION IS OCCURRING ALONG THE CARIBBEAN COASTAL SECTIONS OF
NICARAGUA...SOUTHERN EL SALVADOR...THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF HONDURAS
...WESTERN NICARAGUA...AND THE ADJACENT EAST PACIFIC WATERS.  HEAVY
RAINFALL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FLASH FLOODS AND MUD SLIDES WILL
LIKELY CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO.

...CORRECTION TO 5TH PARAGRAPH...
 
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT MITCH HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE
WESTWARD AND IS IN THE VICINITY OF THE HONDURAS-GUATEMALA-EL
SALVADOR BORDER.  VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT MITCH
STILL HAS A FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION ALTHOUGH 
MOST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPRESSION IS
OCCURRING WELL SOUTH AND EAST OF THE CENTER.  

SEVERAL 15Z SHIPS OBSERVATIONS FROM THE GULF OF HONDURAS WERE
RECEIVED LATE THIS MORNING SHOWING WINDS OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE
...33 KNOTS FROM SHIP C6YE AND 54 KNOTS FROM C6HH3...WELL REMOVED
FROM THE CIRCULATION CENTER. THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE LIKELY
ASSOCIATED WITH A BAND OF STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WHICH HAS SINCE
WEAKENED.  AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE BELIZE METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE
THEY INFORMED US OF THE FUNNELING EFFECT WHICH OCCURS IN THE GULF 
OF HONDURAS. THUS...THESE WINDS ARE LIKELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A
COMBINATION OF THE CONVECTION AND THE LOCAL FUNNELING EFFECT.  
A *SMALL CRAFT REMAIN IN PORT* STATEMENT HAS BEEN ADDED TO BOTH 
THE PUBLIC AND FORECAST/ADVISORY PRODUCTS TO HIGHLIGHT THIS THREAT
TO MARINE AND COASTAL INTERESTS. THIS STATEMENT ALSO COVERS THE
PACIFIC COASTAL AREAS AS THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED AND WE
HAVE RECEIVED SOME SHIP REPORTS OF 25 TO 30 KNOTS...MAINLY OFFSHORE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 270/10 KNOTS. BOTH THE AVIATION AND NAVY
GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE MID-LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE GULF
OF MEXICO BREAKING DOWN DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS AS A SHORTWAVE
TROUGH MOVES OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ONE OWING TO THE
INITIAL WESTWARD MOTION.  THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY OVER 8000-
10000 FT PEAKS AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK HAS THE SYSTEM MOVING OVER
THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF GUATEMALA. THUS...THE SYSTEM MAY NOT
SURVIVE AS LONG AS FORECAST.

THE OFFICIAL TRACK BRINGS THE SYSTEM CLOSER TO THE PACIFIC COAST OF
MEXICO...AND THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT THE CENTER COULD MOVE
INTO...OR REFORM OVER...PACIFIC WATERS LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

MITCH CONTINUES TO PULL IN MOISTURE FROM THE EAST PACIFIC HELPING
FUEL SOME DEEP CONVECTION MAINLY WEST OF THE CENTER.  THE STRONGEST
CONVECTION IS OCCURRING ALONG THE CARIBBEAN COASTAL SECTIONS OF
NICARAGUA...SOUTHERN EL SALVADOR...THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF HONDURAS
...WESTERN NICARAGUA...AND THE ADJACENT EAST PACIFIC WATERS.  HEAVY
RAINFALL AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FLASH FLOODS AND MUD SLIDES WILL
LIKELY CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO.

THE CENTER IS ILL-DEFINED BUT IT APPEARS THAT A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION
HAS CONTINUED SINCE THE LAST ADVISORY.  MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE
SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH IN A DAY OR TWO.  WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS SOUTHERLY TO SOUTHWESTERLY MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL

SHORTWAVE MOVING EAST-NORTHEASTWARD AND THE 500 MB ANTICYCLONE OVER
THE GULF OF MEXICO BREAKING DOWN WITHIN 24-48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AND SHOWS MITCH MOVING INTO
THE GULF OF MEXICO LATER IN THE PERIOD...IF IT SURVIVES.

SINCE THE FORECAST DOES NOT HAVE MITCH MOVING INTO THE EASTERN
PACIFIC...ALTHOUGH THAT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE...IT WILL CONTINUE TO
BE CLASSIFIED AS AN ATLANTIC TROPICAL CYCLONE FOR NOW.

THE CIRCULATION HAS BECOME POORLY-DEFINED AT THE SURFACE...AS IT
CONTINUES TO BE DISRUPTED BY THE MOUNTAINOUS LAND MASS OF GUATEMALA
AND SOUTHEASTERN MEXICO.  MOREOVER...SIGNIFICANT REGENERATION OVER

IN FLYING THROUGH MITCH EARLIER THIS EVENING...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS
PROVIDED CENTER FIXES BUT HAD TO SEARCH AROUND A BIT TO DO SO AS THE
INNER CIRCULATION WAS NOT PARTICULARLY WELL FORMED.  GIVEN THAT THE
SYSTEM IS NOW CENTERED OVER LAND...THE WINDS HAVE LIKELY DECREASED
TO NEAR 35 KT...DESPITE THE BAND OF INTENSE CONVECTION NOTED OVER
THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE.  MITCH COULD BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL
DEPRESSION LATER TONIGHT.
 
MITCH COULD AGAIN RESTRENGTHEN A LITTLE ONCE ITS CENTER LEAVES THE
YUCATAN AND MOVES OVER THE STILL RELATIVELY WARM WATERS OF THE SE
GULF OF MEXICO.  OUTPUT FROM THE 18Z AVN ALSO SUGGESTS THAT MITCH
COULD UNDERGO A MODEST RESTRENGTHENING DUE TO BAROCLINIC PROCESSES
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CYCLONE/S INTERACTION WITH THE APPROACHING
FRONT.  EITHER WAY...MITCH IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A HEAVY RAIN PRODUCER
WITH MUCH OF THE PRECIPITATION TO PRECEDE THE CENTER AND...GIVEN THE
FORECAST MOTION...WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS LIKELY TO BE TO THE SE OF
THE CENTER.
 
THE DYNAMICAL TRACK GUIDANCE TAKES MITCH TOWARD THE NORTHEAST
EITHER ACROSS THE FL PENINSULA OR THE FL STRAITS...EXCEPT THE GFDL
WHICH DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM.  THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF SPEEDS
FORECAST...HOWEVER...WITH 72 HOUR POINTS STRETCHING FROM THE NW
BAHAMAS TO THE AZORES.  THE NHC TRACK REPRESENTS AN INTERMEDIATE
SOLUTION AND IS ESSENTIALLY AN EXTENSION OF OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST.

MOST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH MITCH IS WELL-REMOVED
FROM THE CENTER...WITH ONE AREA OVER THE NORTHEASTERN YUCATAN
EXTENDING SOUTHWARD ALONG THE COAST OF BELIZE AND ANOTHER LARGER
AREA LOCATED OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL/SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. THE
INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE REDUCED TO 30 KT...BRINGING MITCH TO
TROPICAL DEPRESSION STATUS.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
WHICH HAS MITCH RE-STRENGTHENING TO A TROPICAL STORM WITHIN 36 HOURS
AS IT MOVES INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO DUE TO FAVORABLE SST/S
AND INTERACTION WITH AN APPROACHING FRONT. MITCH IS FORECAST TO
BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY 72 HOURS...ALTHOUGH THIS MAY OCCUR SOONER 
AS THE SYSTEM BECOMES ABSORBED BY THE APPROACHING FRONTAL ZONE.
REGARDLESS...THE MAIN THREAT POSED BY MITCH IS LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINFALL MAINLY IN ADVANCE OF THE CENTER.  THE LEADING EDGE OF 
THE RAIN SHIELD IS JUST WEST OF KEY WEST FLORIDA AT THIS TIME. 

INFRARED-BASED SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB PLACE THE POORLY-
DEFINED CENTER OF MITCH OVER THE NORTHWEST YUCATAN PENINSULA ABOUT
MIDWAY BETWEEN MERIDA AND CARMEN MEXICO. HOWEVER...THE LATEST
OBSERVATION FROM MERIDA SHOWS A SSW WIND SUGGESTING THAT THE CENTER

10 AM EST WED NOV 04 1998
 
REPORTS FROM SHIPS AND SURFACE SITES INDICATE THAT MITCH IS NOT
COMPLETELY TROPICAL ANYMORE.  WHILE CONVECTION IS MINIMAL NEAR THE
CENTER AND WINDS WITHIN ABOUT 100 NM OF THE CENTER SEEM TO BE
RELATIVELY LIGHT AT THIS TIME...GALE/TROPICAL STORM FORCE CONDITIONS
ARE OCCURRING IN A CONVECTIVE BAND BETWEEN 200 AND 300 NM SOUTHEAST
TO NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.   TO ACCOMMODATE THIS AND SIMPLIFY THE
WARNING PROCESS REQUIRES UPGRADING MITCH BACK TO A TROPICAL STORM...
WITH 40 KT WINDS.  SOME FILLING IN OF THE WIND FIELD IS LIKELY
DURING THE NEXT DAY.  THE STRUCTURE IS LIKELY TO BE COMPLICATED
FURTHER BY THE INCREASING INTERACTION BETWEEN MITCH AND THE
APPROACHING FRONT.
  
A TROPICAL STORM WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT FOR A PORTION OF THE FL
PENINSULA AND FL KEYS.  NORTHWARD FROM THERE...WINDS ARE ALSO LIKELY
TO INCREASE AND COULD REACH GALE STRENGTH ALONG THE COAST AS MITCH
TRANSITIONS INTO AN EXTRATROPICAL GALE UPON LEAVING FLORIDA.  THIS
IS PREDICATED ON A NORTHEASTWARD FORECAST TRACK WITH INCREASING
FORWARD SPEED...AS IMPLIED BY MOST OF THE NUMERICAL GUIDANCE.

THE PRIMARY IMPACT OF MITCH STILL APPEARS TO BE AREAS OF HEAVY
RAIN...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SEVERE WEATHER...AND LOCALLY GUSTY
WINDS.

HAVE BEEN PUSHED AHEAD A LITTLE TOO FAST ALONG THE TRACK...
HOWEVER...AND THE CURRENT POSITION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LATEST
SHIP OBSERVATIONS.  AS NOTED EARLIER...THE SYSTEM MAY ALREADY HAVE
LOST SOME TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS AND
HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION WELL-REMOVED FROM THE CENTER.  A LITTLE
STRENGTHENING...MAINLY DUE TO BAROCLINIC PROCESSES...COULD OCCUR
DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  MITCH IS LIKELY TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL
BY 48 HOURS OR SOONER.

WITH THE SHEARING ENVIRONMENT...SOME SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AND
ISOLATED TORNADOES MAY OCCUR IN PORTIONS OF THE WARNING AREA DURING
THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO.  AREAS OF HEAVY RAIN WILL CONTINUE
SPREADING OVER THE WARNING AREA THROUGH TONIGHT.  TROPICAL STORM
FORCE WINDS WILL LIKELY OCCUR ONLY IN A FEW OF THE RAINBANDS WELL
EAST OF THE CENTER. 

CURRENT MOVEMENT IS NORTHEAST NEAR 20 KNOTS.  MOST NUMERICAL MODELS

MITCH DOES NOT LOOK VERY TROPICAL...AND IN FACT IF THIS WERE NOT THE
REMNANTS OF MITCH WE WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE CALLING THIS A TROPICAL
CYCLONE.  HOWEVER...TO BEST SERVE THE WARNING PROCESS AND HIGHLIGHT
THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT...WE WILL CONTINUE TO REFER TO THIS SYSTEM
AS A TROPICAL STORM.
 
INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 45 KNOTS BASED ON SHIP REPORTS AND
RECON DATA.  THE STRONGEST WINDS WILL OCCUR IN A FEW OF THE
RAINBANDS WELL EAST OF THE CENTER.  SOME STRENGTHENING...DUE TO
BAROCLINIC PROCESSES...IS POSSIBLE DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  MITCH
WILL LIKELY BE DECLARED EXTRATROPICAL WITHIN 36 HOURS.
 
THE CENTER IS NOT WELL-DEFINED FROM SATELLITE OR RECONNAISSANCE
OBSERVATIONS AND IS ELONGATED ALONG A NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST AXIS.
SOME RELOCATION MAY BE NECESSARY DURING THE NIGHT.  THE CENTER IS
NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE...BUT RATHER THE SEVERE WEATHER
THREAT.  DURING THE EVENING...A TORNADO-PRODUCING MESOCYCLONE WAS
TRACKED WITH THE KEY WEST WSR-88D RADAR OVER THE MIDDLE AND UPPER
FLORIDA KEYS.  WITH THE SHEARING ENVIRONMENT...SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS
AND ISOLATED TORNADOES ARE STILL POSSIBLE OVER PORTIONS OF THE KEYS
AND SOUTHERN/CENTRAL FLORIDA THROUGH THE NIGHT.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NORTHEAST NEAR 23 KNOTS.  MOST NUMERICAL

AS MENTIONED IN EARLIER ADVISORIES MITCH IS NOT VERY TROPICAL IN
APPEARANCE AND ITS TRANSFORMATION TO AN EXTRA-TROPICAL SYSTEM
CONTINUES.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THE BULK OF THE DEEP CONVECTION
EAST OF THE CENTER WITH THE COLDEST CLOUD TOPS...-80 DEG C...MOVING
ONSHORE BETWEEN TAMPA AND NAPLES.   

THE LAST NOAA RECONNAISSANCE PASS THROUGH MITCH REPORTED A CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 993 MB AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS...1500 FT...OF
59 KNOTS.  THE KEY WEST NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR VAD
WIND PROFILE INDICATED 60 KNOTS AT 2000 FT...IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
THE RECON DATA. SINCE THE SYSTEM IS NOT WHOLLY TROPICAL THE USUAL
ADJUSTMENTS TO FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS DOES NOT APPLY.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 45 KNOTS...WITH HIGHER GUSTS POSSIBLE IN
STRONG CONVECTION. SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING...DUE TO BAROCLINIC
PROCESSES...IS SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DURING THE NEXT FEW
DAYS.  MITCH WILL LIKELY BE DECLARED EXTRATROPICAL WITHIN 24 HOURS.

POSITION ESTIMATES FROM THE NOAA RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT SUGGEST
THAT MITCH IS MOVING SLIGHTLY MORE EAST-NORTHEAST AND THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 070/20 KNOTS.  THE CENTER REMAINS ELONGATED
NE-SW AND IS TILTED IN THE VERTICAL...AS EVIDENCED IN THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RADAR AND RECONNAISSANCE FIXES...CONFIRMING
THE ONGOING EXTRA-TROPICAL TRANSITION.  ALL THE DYNAMICAL TRACK
PREDICTION MODELS SHOW A GENERAL EAST-NORTHEAST TO NORTHEAST MOTION 
WITH CONTINUED ACCELERATION THROUGH 48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
REFLECTS THIS...AND REPRESENTS A SLIGHT LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

AS MENTIONED EARLIER...THE CENTER FEATURE IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT
FEATURE RATHER ONE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE...NAMELY
THE CONTINUED HEAVY RAINFALL AND SEVERE WEATHER THREATS.

THE WARNING FOR CUBA WILL LIKELY BE DISCONTINUED LATER THIS MORNING.
THE LOWERING OF TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS FOR FLORIDA WILL BE ADDRESS

HURRICANE HUNTERS HAVE BEEN FLYING SHORE PATROL AROUND THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE PENINSULA.  AT 1118Z THEY REPORTED AN EXTRAPOLATED
PRESSURE OF 988 MB AT THEIR LOCATION JUST WEST OF THE CENTER.  THEY
SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND 73 KT AT THEIR 850 MB FLIGHT LEVEL JUST EAST OF
BISCAYNE BAY.  STRONG CONVECTION IN THE AREA IS LIKELY TRANSPORTING
SOME OF THAT MOMENTUM TOWARD THE SURFACE.  FOWEY ROCKS REPORTED A
10-MIN WIND OF 51 KT.  THEY ALSO HAD A TWO MINUTE WIND OF 52 KT WITH
A GUST TO 63 KT AT THE TOP OF THE 13Z HOUR...WHERE THE AIRCRAFT HAD
ABOUT 65 KT.  HENCE...MITCH RETAINS SOME TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS
AND BASED ON THE OBSERVATIONS THE MAXIMUM WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO
55 KT.

THE CENTER IS NOW EXITING THE FL EAST COAST NEAR JUPITER AND IS
MOVING AT ABOUT 060/23 KT.  A CONTINUED ACCELERATION TOWARD THE NE
IS FORECAST...AS INDICATED BY MODEL GUIDANCE.  THE MODEL TRACKS AND
THE NHC FORECAST PASS NORTH OF BERMUDA IN 24-36 HOURS...BUT ARE

BASED ON DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES...THERE COULD VERY WELL BE WINDS
OF 35 KNOTS OVER A SMALL AREA NEAR THE CENTER.  THIS IS THE BASIS

THE STORM IS LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL PORTION OF A LARGER UPPER-LEVEL
CYCLONE WHERE THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS RELATIVELY WEAK.  THIS IS

MUCH INCREASE IN STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED AND NICOLE IS LIKELY TO
ENCOUNTER LESS FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...AND
WEAKEN.

THE STORM IS MOVING JUST SOUTH OF WEST AND THIS GENERAL MOTION
SHOULD CONTINUE TODAY.  THE MOST REASONABLE STEERING SCENARIO FOR
NICOLE IS A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE WEST AND NORTHWEST DURING THE
PERIOD...AS IT ROUNDS A MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE.  A BROAD

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 250/09...SAME AS LAST ADVISORY.  THE
STORM APPEARS TO BEING STEERED BY THE FLOW BETWEEN AN UPPER LOW AND
A RIDGE TO THE NORTH.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT A SHORT
WAVE APPROACHING FROM THE WEST WILL NOT PICK UP THE STORM AND THAT
IT WILL CONTINUE A MOSTLY WESTWARD MOTION UNTIL THE NEXT SHORT WAVE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BASED ON THIS REASONING AND IS ADJUSTED TO
THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...BUT STILL SHOWS AN INCREASING
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION AFTER 48 HOURS IN RESPONSE TO THE
SECOND SHORT WAVE.  IT IS NOTED THAT MPC GUIDANCE SHOWS THE
ALTERNATE SOLUTION OF THE STORM BEING PICKED UP BY THE FIRST SHORT
WAVE AND THIS WOULD PUT THE 72 HOUR POSITION SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES
NORTHEAST OF THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.
 
UPPER LEVEL WESTERLIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRST SHORT WAVE ARE
WITHIN ABOUT 500 N MI AND ARE EXPECTED TO WEAKEN THE STORM IN ABOUT
24 HOURS.

SHIP REPORTS AT 06Z SHOW THAT THE 24-KNOT WIND SPEED RADII HAVE

10 AM EST WED NOV 25 1998

THE LATEST RUN OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB TROUGH
LIFTING OUT OF THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC AS ANOTHER DIGS NEAR THE U.S.
EAST COAST IN A DAY OR TWO.  THE RESULT OF THIS IS A DISCONTINUOUS
RETROGRESSION WITH A RIDGE DEVELOPING OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC. 
BASED ON THE ABOVE...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED SOUTHWARD...
ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN THE SHALLOW AND MEDIUM-LAYER BAM TRACKS.

HIGH-LEVEL WESTERLY FLOW OVER THE SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE INCREASING
AND NICOLE HAS MORE OF A SHEARED APPEARANCE THAN IT DID YESTERDAY. 
ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS HOMEPAGE SHOW
INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR ALONG THE PROJECTED TRACK.  GRADUAL
WEAKENING OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS FORECAST.

SHEARING CONTINUES TO AFFECT THE STORM AND CENTER IS BECOMING
EXPOSED NEAR THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE DENSE OVERCAST.  DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE NEAR 45 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  FURTHER
WEAKENING IS LIKELY...SINCE STRONG UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC WESTERLIES
SHOULD PERSIST ACROSS THE AREA.

LITTLE CHANGE IS MADE TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST. 
NICOLE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE MOSTLY WESTWARD TO THE SOUTH OF AN
AMPLIFYING MID-LEVEL RIDGE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  IF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE SURVIVES TO THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...A MORE
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION SHOULD DEVELOP AROUND THAT TIME AS THE SYSTEM
NEARS THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS RIDGE.

THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII ARE INCREASED A LITTLE MORE OVER
THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE BASED ON AN 18Z OBSERVATION OF 36 KNOTS FROM
A SHIP...CALL SIGN PJRO...AND SSM/I DATA.

AND 3.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...SUGGESTING THAT WINDS HAVE INCREASED

UNCERTAIN.  HIGH RESOLUTION HIGH LEVEL CLOUD WIND VECTORS DEPICT A
RIDGE OVER NICOLE WHILE WATER VAPOR IMAGES AND 200 MB FORECAST
MODELS INDICATE THAT VERY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLY WINDS SHOULD
REACH THE AREA OF THE STORM SOON.  THIS WOULD SUGGEST RAPID
WEAKENING. ON THE OTHER HAND...BOTH SHIFOR AND THE GFDL BRING NICOLE
TO HURRICANE STATUS.  AT THIS TIME...I DO NOT WANT TO DEVIATE TOO
MUCH FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. THEREFORE...SOME STRENGTHENING IS
INITIALLY INDICATED... FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL WEAKENING. 

NICOLE IS NOW MOVING 290/10.  THERE IS A VERY STRONG COLD FRONT
RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE AND THE BEST ESTIMATE GIVEN
SUCH PATTERN WOULD BE TO FORECAST RECURVATURE.  LATEST GFDL...AVN

10 AM EST SUN NOV 29 1998
 
THE CENTER OF THE STORM REMAINS LOCATED UNDER THE SOUTH-WESTERN EDGE
OF A PERSISTENT MASS OF DEEP CONVECTION.  UPPER-LEVEL DIFFLUENCE
OVER THE AREA APPEARS TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR FOR MAINTAINING
NICOLES INTENSITY AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD
SOON TAKE PLACE SINCE THE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO PERSIST AND THE STORM
IS MOVING OVER COOLER SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES.  NICOLE IS LIKELY TO
LOSE ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN A DAY OR TWO.
 
NICOLE SEEMS TO BE TRACKING ALONG PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK BUT
SLIGHTLY FASTER...050/11 KTS.  TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS VERY SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS GUIDANCE AND CONTINUES TO SHOW A LARGE SPREAD.  THE
UKMET AND NHC98 SHOW CONSIDERABLE ACCELERATION TO THE NORTHEAST. 
THE LBAR...GFDL AND BAMD ARE SLOWER AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS
TWO.  FINALLY...THE BAMS...AVN AND NOGAPS SHOW VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT
AND SLOWLY CURVE THE SYSTEM TO THE SOUTH.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
A COMPROMISE OF THE ABOVE GUIDANCE AND CLOSELY PARALLELS THE GFDL
TRACK AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK BUT SLIGHTLY
FASTER.

SATELLITE PICTURES OVER ABOUT THE PAST 12 HOURS HAVE SHOWN A RAGGED
EYE...SUGGESTING THAT NICOLE HAS PROBABLY BEEN AT THE THRESHOLD OF
HURRICANE STRENGTH FOR PART OF THAT PERIOD.  WITH THAT IN MIND...AND
WITH TAFB DVORAK ANALYSES GIVING NUMBERS OF 3.5 TO 4.0 AT 00Z...
NICOLE WILL BE UPGRADED TO A 65 KT HURRICANE ON THIS ADVISORY. 
CURRENTLY...THE CENTRAL PART OF NICOLE CONSISTS OF A WARM SPOT
EMBEDDED WITHIN A BROKEN RING OF EYEWALL CONVECTION WITH FAIRLY WARM
TOPS.  THE OUTFLOW PATTERN REMAINS DIFFLUENT TO THE EAST WITH MOST
UPPER-LEVEL MOISTURE STREAMING NORTHEASTWARD.
 
INITIAL MOTION USING THE WARM SPOT AS THE CENTER IS 050/13 KT...
SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY ANALYZED.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS
NICOLE CROSSING A NARROW E-W RIDGE AND BEGINNING TO BECOME ENTRAINED
INTO THE WESTERLIES TO THE NORTH.  FLOW AROUND A STRONG TROUGH TO
THE NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED TO CARRY NICOLE TOWARD THE NE...AS
INDICATED BY MOST OF THE GUIDANCE MODEL TRACKS.  BY 36 TO 48 HOURS
...NICOLE SHOULD BE EXTRATROPICAL WHILE PASSING NEAR THE WESTERN

AN EYE IS NO LONGER EVIDENT ON SATELLITE IMAGES...BUT DVORAK
ANALYSES USING THE EMBEDDED CENTER PATTERN SUGGEST THAT THE SYSTEM
IS STILL NEAR HURRICANE STRENGTH.  HOWEVER...THE CLOUD PATTERN IS
BECOMING MORE ASYMMETRIC...WITH MOST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION TO THE
NORTH OF THE CENTER.  GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST AND THE SYSTEM
IS EXPECTED TO MERGE WITH A FRONTAL LOW IN 24 TO 36 HOURS...AS SHOWN
BY THE LATEST AVN RUN OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL.

ALTHOUGH INITIAL MOTION...050/12...IS JUST SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN
BEFORE...MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUE TO SHOW
ACCELERATION WITH STEERING AROUND THE EASTERN SIDE OF A DEEP-LAYER
TROUGH AND CYCLONIC CIRCULATION TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE AZORES.  THE
CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE NCEP
GLOBAL MODEL AND SIMILAR TO THE LATEST GFDL TRACK...THOUGH NOT AS
FAST.  THE FORECAST TRACK SHOWS NICOLE PASSING A LITTLE FARTHER WEST
OF THE AZORES...BUT STILL CLOSE ENOUGH TO POSSIBLY HAVE EFFECTS ON
THOSE ISLANDS IN 24 TO 36 HOURS. 

IT IS OF INTEREST TO NOTE THAT...WITH NICOLE HAVING REACHED
HURRICANE STRENGTH...THE TOTAL OF 33 HURRICANES DURING THE FOUR-

VISIBLE PICTURES HINT AT A POSSIBLE EYE FEATURE RE-EMERGING WITH
A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION JUST NORTH OF THE CENTER.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 65 KNOTS WITH GRADUAL WEAKENING FORECAST  
PER THE LAST PACKAGE.  THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BECOME
EXTRATROPICAL BY 36 HOURS AS IT MERGES WITH A FRONTAL ZONE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 055/12 KNOTS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AS THE TRACK PREDICTION
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE SYSTEM GRADUALLY ACCELERATING AS IT
ROUNDS THE EASTERN SIDE OF A DEEP-LAYER TROUGH AND CYCLONIC
CIRCULATION TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE AZORES. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH BAMD.

THE NHC TRACK FORECAST BRINGS NICOLE SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO THE AZORES

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE LAST
SEVERAL DAYS HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED. FIRST LIGHT
VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE CENTER...ALTHOUGH STILL NOT WELL-
DEFINED...IS NOW SUFFICIENTLY INVOLVED WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION TO
WARRANT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO DEPRESSION STATUS. THE VERTICAL
SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM IS FAIRLY LIGHT ALTHOUGH THE OUTFLOW IS
INHIBITED OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE. THE FORECAST INTENSIFICATION
WILL LIKELY BE LIMITED BY COOLER SST LATER IN THE PERIOD.
 
SATELLITE-BASED CENTER FIXES OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS SHOW
CONSIDERABLE SCATTER. BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS
295/12. THE TRACK FORECAST IS COMPLICATED BY THE AVIATION MODEL
INITIALIZATION OF A SPURIOUS VORTEX TO THE EAST OF THE DEPRESSION.
THIS VORTEX MAY BE PRODUCING A LEFTWARD BIAS IN THE MODEL
FORECASTS...MOST OF WHICH RELY ON THE AVIATION MODEL FIELDS IN
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. MEANWHILE NOGAPS SEEMS TO HAVE A MORE REALISTIC
INITIALIZATION AND SHOWS A MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION. THIS APPEARS
MORE REASONABLE GIVEN THE LARGE MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH
TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE SEEN IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE OPTIONS
AND LEANS TOWARD THE NOGAPS SOLUTION.

ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPRESSION IS VERY BROAD AND POORLY DEFINED. 
LETS FACE IT...THE CENTER CAN BE LOCATED ANYWHERE WITHIN A RADIUS OF
100 N MI. THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS BECOME ELONGATED AND THE CONVECTION
IS SHAPELESS MEANING THAT THE TROPICAL CYCLONE CONTINUES
DISORGANIZED.  SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL HAS ONLY A MODEST
STRENGTHENING...THE GFDL PRACTICALLY DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM BY 72
HOURS OR SO.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS IN BETWEEN AND
CALLS FOR 50 KNOT WINDS...BEFORE THE SYSTEM REACHES COOLER WATERS.
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN INDICATED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 

THE DEPRESSION APPEARS TO BE DRIFTING AIMLESSLY...POSSIBLY DUE TO
THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE INITIAL POSITION.  MOST OF THE MODELS SUGGEST
THAT A RIDGE WILL BUILD TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE AS THE
CURRENT MID-TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE SYSTEM

STATISTICAL MODELS MOVE THE SYSTEM WESTWARD.  IF WARNINGS HAD TO BE
ISSUED UNDER THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TRACK MODELS...IT WOULD
REQUIRE TO ISSUE THEM FOR A RATHER LARGE AREA.  

SINCE GLOBAL MODELS ARE BUILDING A STRONG MID-LEVEL RIDGE FROM THE
GULF OF MEXICO ACROSS BAJA CALIFORNIA AND WESTWARD...A CONTINUED
MOTION TOWARD THE WEST OR WEST NORTHWEST IS REASONABLE AS SUGGESTED
BY CLIMATOLOGY AND BAM MODELS.

LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT DEEP CONVECTION REMAINS
NEAR THE CIRCULATION CENTER AND BANDING FEATURES ARE INCREASING.   
T-NUMBERS RANGE FROM 2.5 AT SAB AND GLOBAL TO 3.0 AT TAFB.  ALSO THE
OUTFLOW PATTERN HAS IMPROVED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE SYSTEM IN THE
PAST 24-HOURS. THEREFORE THE SYSTEM IS BEING UPGRADED TO TROPICAL
STORM AGATHA...THE FIRST EASTERN PACIFIC STORM OF THE 1998 SEASON.
THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO REMAIN A TROPICAL STORM UNTIL IT MOVES
OVER COOLER WATERS WITHIN THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS. 
 
TRACK MODELS REMAIN IN DISAGREEMENT.  HOWEVER...THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE
FORECAST BY GLOBAL MODELS TO BUILD TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE SYSTEM
APPEARS CORRECT.  THUS...THE OFFICIAL TRACK CONTINUES TOWARD THE
WEST-NORTHWEST.

ON THIS ACCELERATION. SATELLITE-BASED FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE

TO INSIST ON A SOUTHWEST MOTION BY 24 HOURS. THE REMAINDER OF THE
GUIDANCE SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWEST MOTION...AND IS THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST REFLECTS THIS. THE PRIMARY DISCREPANCY IS WITH THE FORWARD
SPEED. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A GRADUAL DECELERATION AS
THE MEAN STEERING DIMINISHES...IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH LBAR. THE

SATELLITE-BASED DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE

WARM SPOT IN SATELLITE IMAGERY DURING THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS THE SYSTEM AT 55 KNOTS THROUGH 24 HOURS 
THEN GRADUALLY WEAKENS IT AS IT MOVES INTO COOLER WATERS.

8 PM PDT SAT JUN 13 1998

AGATHA HAS A WELL DEFINED CURVED CLOUD BAND THAT WRAPS AROUND THE
CENTER...BUT DEEP CONVECTION IS LIMITED.  T-NUMBERS FROM ALL
AGENCIES ARE BETWEEN 3.0 AND 3.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE. THEREFORE...
THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 55 KNOTS.  AGATHA IS ABOUT TO CROSS
THE 26 DEGREE ISOTHERM AND IS HEADING FOR COOLER WATERS. SO...
WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN SOON. 

MODELS ARE BUILDING SUCH A STRONG RIDGE NORTH OF AGATHA THAT THE
STORM IS BEING FORECAST...BY SOME MODELS... TO MOVE SOUTHWARD AND
EVEN SOUTHEASTWARD. THE UK MODEL HAS NOW JOINED THE GFDL AND THE AVN
IN THIS VENTURE. BAM MODELS ARE DECREASING THE FORWARD SPEED OF THE
STORM AND THEN TURN IT EASTWARD WHILE NOGAPS AND STATISTICAL MODELS
ARE MOVING AGATHA WESTWARD.  THIS WOULD MAKE SENSE IF THE STORM
WEAKENS FAST AND THE TRACKING ALGORITHM GATHERS SOME OTHER SPURIOUS
VORTICES NOT RELATED TO AGATHA. I HARD TO ACCEPT THAT...IN THIS
CASE...GLOBAL MODELS AND THE GFDL WOULD BE SO WRONG.   

AT THIS TIME...WITH SUCH A DISCREPANCY...I WOULD GO WITH GOOD OLD
CLIMATOLOGY AND PERSISTENCE...AND MOVE AGATHA ON A GENERAL WEST
NORTHWEST TRACK WITH A DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED WHICH IS NOW ABOUT
17 KNOTS. OBVIOUSLY..IF THE STORM MOVES SOUTHWARD...AS SUGGESTED BY
SOME MODELS...THE SST ARGUMENT IS NOT VALID AND THE STORM WILL
PROBABLY SURVIVE LONGER.

IN SPITE OF BEING OVER SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ESTIMATED AROUND 23
DEGREES CELSIUS...THE STORM HAS MAINTAINED SOME DEEP CONVECTION
AROUND ITS CENTER.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 45 KNOTS FOLLOWING
DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM TAFB MIAMI AND SAB WASHINGTON.  SOUTHWESTERLY
VERTICAL SHEAR IS FORECAST TO INCREASE OVER AGATHA AND COOLER WATERS
SHOULD EVENTUALLY TAKE THEIR TOLL ON THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. 
WEAKENING TO A DEPRESSION IS FORECAST WITHIN 24 HOURS OR SO.  THE
SYSTEM SHOULD BE DISSIPATING LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

AGATHA IS NEARING THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE
AND IS CURRENTLY MOVING NORTHWESTWARD AROUND 9 KNOTS.  SOME FURTHER
SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED IS EXPECTED.  IF THIS WERE A STRONGER
SYSTEM...AGATHA WOULD PROBABLY BEGIN TO RECURVE AROUND THE RIDGE AND
BE STEERED NORTHWARD AND NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD DUE TO A MID- TO UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH OR CYCLONIC SHEAR AXIS EXTEND SOUTHWESTWARD FROM
NORTHERN BAJA.  AGATHA IS A RATHER WEAK STORM HOWEVER...AND ITS
MOTION IS MORE LIKELY TO BE CONTROLLED BY SHALLOWER-LAYER
STEERING...I.E. THE TRADEWINDS.  OUR TRACK MODELS CONTINUE TO BE
HIGHLY DIVERGENT...AND AT THIS TIME THE MOST PRUDENT FORECAST SEEMS
TO BE A MAINTENANCE OF A SLOW NORTHWEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION.

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THAT HAS BEEN MOVING SOUTH OF THE          
CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICAN COASTS DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS     
BECOME A LITTLE BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY.  LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE   
PICTURES SHOW A LARGE CIRCULATION WITH SOME BANDING FEATURES.       
THEREFORE...THE SYSTEM IS BEING CLASSIFIED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.

THE CENTER APPEARS TO BE ELONGATED AND STILL IS IN FORMATIVE STAGE  
SO ADJUSTMENTS IN THE INITIAL POSITION MAY BE REQUIRED LATER.       
                                                                    
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS 30 KT...IN AGREEMENT WITH TAFB DVORAK      
CLASSIFICATIONS.  THE OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED SINCE THE SYSTEM IS     
UNDER EASTERLY SHEAR BUT LIGHT ENOUGH TO ALLOW A GRADUAL            
STRENGTHENING.  THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM IN 18 HOURS AND SHIPS
BEGINS TO WEAKEN IT BY 48 HOURS BASICALLY DUE TO COOL SST.          
HOWEVER..SHIPS IS BASED ON LBAR TRACK FORECAST WHICH HAS A NORTHWARD
BIAS.                                                               
                                                                    
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/15. GLOBAL MODELS        
MAINTAIN A 500 MB RIDGE FROM MEXICO WESTWARD ANN THIS PATTERN WILL  
KEEP THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ON THE SAME GENERAL WET NORTHWEST TRACK

ANIMATION OF SATELLITE PICTURES AGAIN SHOWS A LARGE CIRCULATION
ELONGATED FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST.  THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION
CENTER IS LOCATED NEAR A CONVECTIVE CLUSTER IN THE NORTHEAST PART OF
THE ELONGATION BASED ON TAFB AND SAB ANALYSES.  INITIAL MOTION IS
ESTIMATED AT 290/15 KT.  CLOUD TOPS ARE WARMING AT THE MOMENT WHILE
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES SUPPORT KEEPING THE SYSTEM AS A
DEPRESSION IN THIS ADVISORY.
 
THE AVN MODEL MAINTAINS A STRONG AND LARGE ANTICYCLONE OVER
NORTH-CENTRAL MEXICO AND THE SOUTH-CENTRAL UNITED STATES THROUGH THE
72 HOUR FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS PATTERN IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE MOVING GENERALLY TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST WITH
LITTLE CHANGE IN FORWARD SPEED.  THE TRACK MODELS AND OFFICIAL
FORECAST ALSO SHOW THAT OUTCOME.   THE GFDL SHOWS DISSIPATION WITHIN
24 HOURS...WHILE THE UKMET SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING SOMETHING ELSE THAT
IT HAS MODELED ABOUT 5 DEGREES TO THE SOUTH. 
 
SOME EASTERLY UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE PRESENT WITH AN OTHERWISE
PROMINENT OUTFLOW.  ON THE FORECAST TRACK...THE SYSTEM HAS ONLY 
ANOTHER DAY OR SO TO BECOME MORE CONSOLIDATED AND STRENGTHEN PRIOR
TO REACHING THE SHARP GRADIENT AND A NEGATIVE ANOMALY IN SSTS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT SAT JUN 20 1998
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/16.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS
SHOW A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD MOTION FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS UNDER
THE INFLUENCE OF A RIDGE TO THE NORTH.  THE BAM AND GFDL MODELS SHOW
A SLIGHT SOUTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.  BUT THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL
UNREALISTICALLY INITIALIZES A TROPICAL STORM NEAR 08N 92W AND
INTENSIFIES IT TO A HURRICANE IN 24 TO 36 HOURS AND THIS COULD CAUSE
THE SOUTHWARD MOTION OF THE DEPRESSION.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY MOVING THE SYSTEM
WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD WITH SOME DECELERATION.

THERE HAS BEEN A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR WHERE THE CENTER IS
ASSUMED TO BE LOCATED DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THE LAST COUPLE OF
IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THE BURST HAS PEAKED.  DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE NEAR STORM STRENGTH WITH A 2.5 T NUMBER FROM TAFB AND
2.0 FROM SAB AND KGWC.  THE SYSTEM IS KEPT AT DEPRESSION STRENGTH
FOR THIS ADVISORY AND FORECAST TO A STORM IN 12 HOURS.  THE FORECAST
TRACK BRINGS THE CENTER OVER SSTS BELOW 23 DEGREES C IN 72 HOURS
WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REVERSE THE FORECAST OF SLOW STRENGTHENING
DURNING THE FIRST DAY OR TWO.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT SAT JUN 20 1998

THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS AND THE MAIN FEATURE IS A CLUSTER OF DEEP CONVECTION JUST EAST
OF THE CENTER.  THE DEPRESSION MAY BE VERY CLOSE TO BE A STORM.
HOWEVER...SINCE CONVECTIVE TOPS ARE WARMING AND THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER
IS POORLY DEFINED...WE WILL KEEP THE SYSTEM AS A DEPRESSION IN THIS
ADVISORY.  VISIBLE PICTURES LATER TODAY MAY INDICATE IF THE SYSTEM
HAS BECOME A TROPICAL STORM.  THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO
CROSS THE SHARP GRADIENT OF SST IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS SO
STRENGTHENING...IF OCCURS...HAS TO BE SOON.  BOTH GFDL AND SHIPS
WEAKEN THE SYSTEM BEYOND 36 TO 48 HOURS AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.

THE INITIAL MOTION CONTINUES TO BE 290/16 AND NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
IS EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO. THEREAFTER...A TURN MORE TO
THE WEST IS LIKELY AS THE SYSTEM WEAKENS AND BECOME STEERED BY THE
LOW LEVEL FLOW. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES AS WELL AS NRL MONTEREY ARRAY OF SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOW THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER OF THE DEPRESSION IS
PARTIALLY EXPOSED AND IS LOCATED TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE MAIN
CONVECTION. THIS WAS CAUSED PRIMARILY BY PREVAILING NORTHEASTERLY
WIND SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM.  THE INITIAL POSITION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED
A LITTLE TO THE EAST NORTHEAST OF THE LOCATION GIVEN IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY. THE SYSTEM MAY BE VERY NEAR TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS
BUT... SINCE THE CONVECTION IS CURRENTLY WEAKENING AND THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE IS HEADING FOR COOLER WATERS...IT IS BEING KEPT AS A
DEPRESSION IN THIS ADVISORY.  HOWEVER...A CONVECTIVE BURST COULD
BRING THE SYSTEM TO STORM STATUS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 HOURS BEFORE
WEAKENING OVER COOL WATER BEGINS. BOTH GFDL AND SHIPS DISSIPATE THE
DEPRESSION BY 48 HOURS OR SO.
 
THE DEPRESSION HAS SLOWED DOWN AND IS NOW MOVING 290/11.  A GRADUAL

OF DEEP CONVECTION OVER AND JUST WEST OF THE CIRCULATION CENTER.
THE SYSTEM IS KEPT AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION BASED ON ANALYSES OF
SATELLITE PICTURES.  SOME GROUND TRUTH ON THE INTENSITY COULD COME
FROM SOCORRO ISLAND WHICH WILL BE NEAR THE CYCLONE CENTER DURING THE

PERSISTS...NOW TOWARD 295/10 KT.
 
A MODEST LEFTWARD BEND IN THE TRACK COULD OCCUR OVER THE NEXT DAY OR

ANTICYCLONE THAT LAYS AHEAD OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE...AND THE
INCREASING INFLUENCE OF LOW-LEVEL STEERING WHILE THE DEPRESSION
WEAKENS OVER COOLER WATERS.  THE TRACK MODELS AND OFFICIAL FORECAST

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THAT WAS CENTERED ABOUT 500 MILES SOUTH OF
THE GULF OF TEHUANTEPEC FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS HAS BECOME BETTER
ORGANIZED DURING THE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING HOURS. LATEST INFRARED
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 2.0 AND 2.5 FROM SAB AND TAFB
RESPECTIVELY.  ALSO...LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW A WELL
FORMED CIRCULATION WITH THE CENTER EMBEDDED IN THE DEEP CONVECTION.
THEREFORE...THE SYSTEM IS BEING CLASSIFIED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION
WITH MAXIMUM WINDS OF 30 KTS.
 
THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER THAT WAS BEING SHEARED BY NORTHEAST
UPPER LEVEL WINDS YESTERDAY MOVED RAPIDLY TOWARD THE NORTHWEST
DURING THE EVENING AND NOW THE NORTHEAST WINDS ARE CREATING GOOD
OUTFLOW IN THE SOUTHERN QUADRANT. OUTFLOW IN THE NORTHERN QUADRANT
IS ALSO FAVORABLE.  SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE FORECASTS THE SYSTEM TO
A HURRICANE IN 48 HRS BECAUSE OF LOW VALUES OF FORECASTED VERTICAL
SHEAR AND VERY WARM SST ALONG THE FORECASTED TRACK.  THEREFORE...THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS FOR THIS DEPRESSION TO BE NAMED IN
THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO AND A HURRICANE IN APPROXIMATELY TWO DAYS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/09.  ALL TRACK MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN
THE DIRECTION OF MOTION BUT DIFFER IN FORWARD SPEED AT THE LATER
FORECAST PERIODS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE DIRECTION OF THE
FORECASTS BUT IS A COMPROMISE IN THE DIFFERENT SPEEDS.

TROPICAL STORM BLAS DISCUSSION NUMBER   2
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT MON JUN 22 1998

TROPICAL DEPRESSION THREE-E IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM BLAS.
 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE BOTH 3.0 FROM SAB AND TAFB.
THE SYSTEM IS ON A MODERATE INTENSIFICATION TREND. VISIBLE PICTURE
ANIMATION SHOWS GOOD UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW IN ALL QUADS EXCEPT THE
NORTHEAST WHERE IT IS EITHER NEUTRAL OR SLIGHTLY INWARD.  THE SYSTEM
IS LOCATED OVER SOME OF THE WARMEST WATERS IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC SO
THAT THE SUPPLY OF LATENT AND SENSIBLE HEAT IS NOT A PROBLEM.
THEREFORE...THE SYSTEM IS BEING UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM
WITH MAXIMUM WINDS OF 45 KTS.  INTENSIFICATION TO A HURRICANE IS
FORECAST IN 24 HOURS OR SO.
  
INITIAL MOTION IS 310/13.  ALL TRACK MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN
THE DIRECTION OF MOTION BUT DIFFER IN FORWARD SPEED. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST FOLLOWS THE DIRECTION OF THE MODEL FORECASTS BUT IS A
COMPROMISE IN THE DIFFERENT SPEEDS.

...CORRECTION FOR STORM NAME....

SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS SHOWS A BURST OF DEEP
CONVECTION...TOPS NEAR -80C...OCCURRING OVER THE ESTIMATED CENTER OF
BLAS. THE OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE IS WELL-DEFINED WHILE
IMPROVING OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE. DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE 3.0 AND 3.5 FROM TAFB AND SAB RESPECTIVELY. THEREFORE
THE INITIAL INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY IS SET AT 50 KNOTS. THE
FORECAST BRINGS BLAS TO HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 24 HOURS. BOTH GFDL
AND SHIPS SUPPORT THIS SCENARIO WITH SHIPS SUGGESTING THE WARM SST
AS THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.        
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 305/11. THIS REPRESENTS A SLIGHT
DECELERATION FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...LIKELY IN RESPONSE TO A
MID- TO UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. ALTHOUGH MOST OF
THE TRACK MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN WITH A GENERAL NORTHWEST
MOTION THEY DIVERGE CONSIDERABLY WITH REGARDS TO THE SPEED. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS FASTER THAN CLIPPER AND NHC90 WHILE
SLOWER THAN THE MID AND DEEP BAMS AND LBAR. IT CLOSELY RESEMBLES
THE GFDL. NOGAPS IS THE ONLY MODEL WHICH BRINGS BLAS MORE NORTHWARD
TOWARDS THE COAST OF MEXICO.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/09.  THIS IS A PAST 24 HOUR
MOTION.  THE STORM HAS SLOWED IN FORWARD SPEED AND THE MOTION OVER
THE PAST 12 HOURS MAY BE AS SLOW AS 6 KNOTS.  ALL OF THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR 72 HOURS. 
THIS IS BASED ON A RIDGE HOLDING TO THE NORTH OF THE STORM AS
INDICATED ON THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL RUN.  MOST OF THE MODELS
MAINTAIN ABOUT A 10 KNOT SPEED EXCEPT THE UKMET WHICH IS MUCH SLOWER
AND LBAR WHICH IS SOMEWHAT FASTER.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS IN THE
MIDDLE AND NEAR THE GFDL AND NOGAPS MODELS.

A COLD CDO IS PERSISTING OVER THE CENTER OF THE STORM.  INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB ARE DVORAK T NUMBER 3.5 OR 55 KNOTS
WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR INCREASING THE CURRENT WIND SPEED TO THIS
VALUE.  THE FORECAST IS FOR CONTINUED STRENGTHENING TO 85 KNOTS IN
36 HOURS...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE SHIPS MODEL AND
SHIFOR BRING BLAS TO 90 KNOTS IN 36 HOURS WHILE THE GFLD STAYS BELOW
70 KNOTS.

BLAS CONTINUES TO GRADUALLY BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED WITH A WELL-
DEFINED AND STRONG BANDING FEATURE IN THE SHAPE OF THE NUMBER
6.  IT COULD MAKE IT TO HURRICANE INTENSITY LATER TODAY...BUT DVORAK
SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS DO NOT YET SUPPORT INCREASING THE WIND
SPEED ABOVE 55 KT.  THE ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS HAS LED TO SOME
JUMPING AROUND OF THE ESTIMATED SATELLITE-DERIVED POSITION
ESTIMATES.  INITIAL MOTION IS CURRENTLY NEAR 300/11 KT.
 
THE 00Z MRF OUTPUT SUGGESTS THAT THE LARGE WSW-ENE ORIENTED
ANTICYCLONE OVER NORTHERN MEXICO WILL REMAIN IN PLACE DESPITE THE
FORECAST PROGRESSION OF SEVERAL TROUGHS INTO THE U.S. WEST COAST.
HENCE...LITTLE CHANGE IN TRACK HEADING OR SPEED IS SHOWN IN THE NHC
FORECAST FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH TRACK
MODELS AS WELL...EXCEPT FOR A MUCH SLOWER SPEED INDICATED BY THE
UKMET...AND THE 06Z GFDL RUN WHICH ENDS UP A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES
NORTH OF MOST OF THE OTHER GUIDANCE...AND ITS 00Z FORECAST.
 
THE PATTERN ALSO CONTAINS A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL LOW SEEN IN WV IMAGERY
OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO.  THIS FEATURE APPEARS TO BE
CONTRIBUTING TO THE OUTFLOW ALOFT FROM THE CYCLONE.  WITH WARM
WATERS AHEAD AND THIS ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT...INTENSIFICATION IS
FORECAST THROUGH 48 HOURS.  SOMEWHAT COOLER THAN NORMAL WATERS COULD
AFFECT BLAS THEREAFTER.

2 PM PDT TUE JUN 23 1998
 
SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW AN IMPRESSIVE PRIMARY RAINBAND WRAPPED
AROUND A SMALL CENTRAL CONVECTIVE BALL...WITH HINTS OF A BANDING-
TYPE EYE.  TAFB DVORAK CLASSIFICATION HAS REACHED 4.0 AND SUPPORTS
UPGRADING BLAS TO BE THE FIRST HURRICANE OF THE YEAR IN THE EASTERN
NORTH PACIFIC.  FORWARD SPEED HAS INCREASED TO 13 KT...STILL TOWARD
THE WNW.
 
THE 06Z AVN RUN MAINTAINS THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH THROUGH WEST
OF BLAS WHICH IMPLIES A GENERAL CONTINUATION OF ITS CURRENT MOTION
...AS INDICATED BY NEARLY ALL TRACK MODELS.  THIS TRACK IS ROUGHLY
PARALLEL TO...AND ABOUT 300 MILES OFFSHORE OF...THE COAST.  

A TROUGH THAT MOVES ONSHORE CALIFORNIA IN ABOUT 72 HOURS DOES WEAKEN
THE HIGH A LITTLE...LEAVING AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE THAT BLAS COULD
EVENTUALLY HAVE SOME IMPACT ON FAR SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA.  THE
GFDL TRACK SUGGESTS THIS...BUT IT IS AN OUTLIER FROM THE OTHER
GUIDANCE AND GFDL METEOROLOGISTS INDICATE THAT THE GFDL MODEL MAY
HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A LESS THAN OPTIMAL AVN
INITIALIZATION.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST AGAIN CALLS FOR INTENSIFICATION DURING THE
NEXT DAY OR TWO...BEFORE BLAS REACHES SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER WATERS.

BLAS HAS INTENSIFIED CONSIDERABLY THIS EVENING.  AN EYE HAS RECENTLY
APPEARED IN SATELLITE IMAGERY AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED
TO 90 KNOTS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST DVORAK ESTIMATE FROM TAFB.
WITH THE OUTFLOW AROUND BLAS WELL-ESTABLISHED AND WARM SST/S...
CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER 24 HOURS.
WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS IT ENCOUNTERS COOLER WATERS ONLY TOWARD THE
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
THE SYSTEM REMAINS ON A WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING WITH THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE OF 290/14 KNOTS. THE MID-TO UPPER LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC
ANTICYCLONE POSITIONED OVER NORTHWESTERN MEXICO..PER LATEST WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY... SHOULD KEEP BLAS ON THIS GENERAL COURSE THROUGH
72 HOURS. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE GLOBAL SPECTRAL MODEL 500 MB
ENSEMBLE DATA. THE SHORT-WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER THE WESTERN U.S.
COULD WEAKEN THE RIDGE ENOUGH TO SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED LATER IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH

SUBJECTIVE DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB MIAMI AND SAB WASHINGTON
YIELDED A SIMILAR RANGE FOR THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE.  MAXIMUM
WINDS ARE KEPT AT 100 KNOTS...BUT THERE IS STILL SOME POTENTIAL FOR
STRENGTHENING SINCE THE UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN CONTINUES TO
LOOK IMPRESSIVE AND THE SEA SURFACE IS STILL FAIRLY WARM.  HOWEVER
WITHIN A DAY OR SO...WEAKENING IS LIKELY TO COMMENCE AS WATER
TEMPERATURES BECOME MARGINAL.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS IN

HOURS.  IN FACT...IT HAS DISAPPEARED IN THE LATEST INFRARED
SATELLITE IMAGES.  THUS...THE ANTICIPATED WEAKENING TREND HAS
BEGUN.  THIS IS SUPPORTED BY OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE DVORAK
T NUMBERS TRENDS.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 115 KNOTS
FOR THIS ADVISORY WITH GRADUAL WEAKENING THROUGH 72 HOURS...
CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED
TO BE BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 48 HOURS AS IT APPROACHES
22C WATERS.  THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS98
INTENSITY FORECAST MODELS.  HOWEVER...THE WEAKENING MAY BE
MORE RAPID IF BLAS MOVES AT A FASTER PACE.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE NOW OF 305/09 KNOTS.  THE DEEP-LAYER
MEAN RIDGE EXTENDING FROM NORTHERN MEXICO INTO THE PACIFIC SHOULD
KEEP BLAS ON A GENERAL NORTHWEST COURSE THROUGH 48 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO DECELERATE AND TAKE A MORE
NORTHERLY HEADING AS IT APPROACHES THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE
RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL
AND SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN THE BAM MODELS.

AND...EVEN THOUGH ITS TRACK IS NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE SST

THAT IT HAS BEEN SO SLOW TO WEAKEN...IN SPITE OF RELATIVELY COOL

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW JUST SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST AT 10

THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT SOUTH OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.  IT SHOULD BE
NOTED HOWEVER THAT...IN GENERAL...SEVERAL OF THE DYNAMICALLY-BASED

A 45-KNOT OBSERVATION FROM SHIP KGTI AND SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE
THAT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING OFF THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF
MEXICO DURING THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND
HAS REACHED TROPICAL STORM STATUS.  THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER OF CELIA
CAN NOW BE OBSERVED BY THE CUYUTLAN RADAR IN MEXICO.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS SET AT 40 KNOTS.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST FOR
THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO BEFORE THE SYSTEM ENCOUNTERS COOLER SST/S.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/14 KNOTS.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST
TO REMAIN NORTH OF THE SYSTEM SO THIS GENERAL TRACK IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH A GRADUAL DECREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS...
INCLUDING CLIMATOLOGY.   

RADAR AND SATELLITE SHOW THAT THERE ARE BANDS OF HEAVY SHOWERS
APPROACHING THE COAST OF MEXICO WEST OF ZIHUATANEJO.  THIS ACTIVITY
WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE AREA THROUGH THE DAY...PRODUCING HEAVY

THE CENTER OF CELIA CAN BE OBSERVED FROM LOS CABOS RADAR IN MEXICO
AND IT IS ALSO DEPICTED IN THE LAST AVAILABLE SSM/I IMAGE. IT
APPEARS THAT THE STORM IS JUST PASSING ABOUT 120 N MI TO THE SOUTH
OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA WHILE MOVING NEARLY 305/15.
IF THIS TRACK CONTINUES...AS EXPECTED...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS WILL
PROBABLY BE DISCONTINUED LATER THIS MORNING.

THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN INTENSITY AS INDICATED BY T-
NUMBERS.  THE CENTER OF THE STORM APPEARS TO BE EMBEDDED WITHIN A
SMALL BUT CONCENTRATED AREA OF VERY DEEP CONVECTION AT THIS TIME. 
HOWEVER...IN ABOUT 12 HOURS OR LESS...CELIA WILL BE MOVING OVER COOL
WATERS SO A GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN.  GFDL MODEL ALSO WEAKENS
CELIA. 

THE STORM IS MOVING AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A DEEP LAYER MEAN HIGH
PRESSURE SYSTEM LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES. GLOBAL
MODELS INDICATE THAT THE HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD WESTWARD.
CONSEQUENTLY...MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS FORECAST A GENERAL NORTHWEST
TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. SINCE
CELIA IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN...IT WILL PROBABLY BE STEERED MORE TO
THE WEST BY THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW AS SUGGESTED BY BAM SHALLOW LATER IN
THE FORECAST PERIOD. 

NOTE: PLEASE IGNORE THE LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION TO THE WEST OF
CELIA GENERATED BY THE AVN MODEL.  THIS FEATURE IS SO LARGE AND SO
UNREALISTIC IN THE MODEL THAT CELIA IS PRACTICALLY NOT REPRESENTED.

WARMED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...SUGGESTING THAT WINDS SHOULD SOON
DECREASE FROM THE ESTIMATED 50 KT ON THIS ADVISORY.  TWO SHIP
REPORTS...ONE AT 12Z AND ONE FROM VWSD AT 03Z...IMPLY A SOMEWHAT
SMALLER CIRCULATION THAN PREVIOUSLY INDICATED.
 
THE 06Z AVN...LIKE ITS PREDECESSORS...CONTAINS SPURIOUS STRONG
VORTICES IN ITS INITIALIZATION WHICH WILL LIKELY HAVE AN ADVERSE
IMPACT ON ITS TRACK FORECAST OF CELIA.  NOTWITHSTANDING...THE
CONTROLLING FEATURE FOR TRACK IS THE STRONG ANTICYCLONE THAT IS
FORECAST TO REMAIN TO THE NW TO N OF CELIA FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
THAT HIGH AND THE INCREASING INFLUENCE OF LOW-LEVEL STEERING SHOULD
DRIVE CELIA GENERALLY TOWARD THE NW AND THEN THE WNW AS INDICATED BY
MOST TRACK GUIDANCE AND THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.
 
GIVEN THE FORECAST TRACK AND THE REDUCED WIND RADII...IT IS LIKELY
THAT THE THREAT TO SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA IS LESSENED.
ACCORDINGLY...THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO IS DISCONTINUING THE

SST ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM IS ENTERING 24-25C WATERS.
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB INDICATE THAT
CELIA IS ON A WEAKENING TREND WITH T-NUMBERS OF 2.5 AND 3.0
RESPECTIVELY.  THUS...THE INTENSITY WILL BE LOWERED TO 40 KNOTS
FOR THIS ADVISORY.  GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THE
SYSTEM EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE WITHIN 48 HOURS.
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS SHOWS THAT CELIA HAS
BEEN MOVING ON A MORE WESTERLY HEADING.  THIS IS CONFIRMED BY 06Z
TAFB AND SAB FIX LOCATIONS.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 275/10
KNOTS.  THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE THAT RELY ON AVIATION MODEL FIELDS
...WHICH CONTINUE A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS...ARE
CONSIDERED SUSPECT DUE TO THE SPURIOUS VORTEX SOUTHWEST OF CELIA.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK CALLS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION
THROUGH 48 HOURS.  THIS IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH CLIPER...
NOGAPS AND UKMET GUIDANCE AND IS CONSISTENT WITH LOWER TROPOSPHERIC
STEERING.

8 AM PDT SUN JUL 19 1998

ALTHOUGH DEEP CONVECTION HAS DECREASED...CELIA STILL HAS A WELL-
ORGANIZED CLOUD PATTERN.  DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS SHOW LITTLE CHANGE
IN STRENGTH SO CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 40 KNOTS.  SINCE
VERTICAL SHEAR IN THE STORM/S ENVIRONMENT IS LIGHT...WEAKENING WILL
BE SLOW.  NONETHELESS AS SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES IN THE CYCLONE/S
PATH ARE IN THE 22-23 DEG C RANGE IT IS LIKELY THAT THE SYSTEM WILL
BE DISSIPATING IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

NOT MUCH CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE TO THE TRACK FORECAST.  MOTION
CONTINUES SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE WEST NEAR 9 KNOTS.  THE CURRENT
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND IS GENERALLY
TO THE SOUTH OF THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE.  AS HAS BEEN NOTED
EARLIER...MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS LIKELY BEING ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY A LARGE SPURIOUS VORTEX IN THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
SITUATED ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO THE SOUTHWEST OF CELIA.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS BECOME RATHER SPARSE IN CELIA...ALTHOUGH A FEW
CELLS SPORADICALLY DEVELOP NEAR THE CENTER.  THE CYCLONE IS STILL
FAIRLY WELL-ORGANIZED AND IS ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR MINIMAL TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH...AS PER DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM THE TPC TROPICAL

FORECAST SINCE SST/S ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE 22-23 DEG C RANGE
ALONG THE PATH OF THE SYSTEM.  CELIA SHOULD BE DISSIPATING IN A

NO CHANGES TO THE MOTION ARE APPARENT AND THE TRACK FORECAST FROM
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY IS MERELY EXTENDED FARTHER TO THE WEST. 
AGAIN...AS NOTED EARLIER...THE LACK OF REAL DATA AND THE PRESENCE OF

DVORAK T-NUMBERS OF 2.0...AND TO SUPPORT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO
TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIVE-E.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS MOST PROMINENT
IN THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE...REPRESENTING A CHANGE FROM YESTERDAY
WHEN A SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR WAS EVIDENT.  THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN MOVING
TOWARD ABOUT 290/11 KT.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND SOUNDING DATA SHOW AN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED

AVN AND GFDL IMPLY SOME WESTWARD RIDGING OF THE HIGH TO THE NORTH OF
THE STORM.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS BASED ON THAT DEVELOPMENT AND
SHOWS A MOSTLY WNW TO W MOTION WITH SOME ACCELERATION.
 
A HIGH LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY CURRENT IS IMPINGING ON THE NORTHWEST

DARBY CONTINUES ON A CLIMATOLOGICALLY-FAVORED WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/10 KNOTS.  DARBY/S MOTION
APPEARS TO BE CONTROLLED PRIMARILY BY THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH

DRIFT WEST IN RESPONSE TO THE WESTWARD BUILDING RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST ACCEPTS THIS SCENARIO...AND IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ONE SHOWING A GENERAL WEST/WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION.
 
UPPER AIR ANALYSIS AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS NO IMPEDANCE TO
FURTHER INTENSIFICATION.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST WITH

2 PM PDT FRI JUL 24 1998
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/10.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
ALL SHOW A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION WITH SOME ACCELERATION THROUGN
72 HOURS...ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT CLEAR FROM THE AVIATION MODEL 12Z RUN
AS TO WHY THE MOTION SHOULD ACCELERATE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND SHOWS
ONLY A SMALL ACCELERATION.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A WELL DEFINED EYE HAS FORMED OVER THE PAST
FEW HOURS AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 80 KNOTS.  THIS
IS BETWEEN THE 4.5 DVORAK T NUMBER FROM TAFB AND THE 5.0 T NUMBER
FROM SAB.  THE ONLY FACTOR TO AFFECT THE INCREASING INTENSITY TREND
IS THAT THE TRACK MOVES OVER SLIGHTLY COOLER WATER AFTER 36 HOURS.

HURRICANE DARBY DISCUSSION NUMBER   8
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT FRI JUL 24 1998

DARBY HAS INTENSIFIED RAPIDLY DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AND MAXIMUM
WINDS ARE 100 KNOTS.  THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON SUBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS
FROM SAB...TAFB AND RAW NUMBERS OBTAINED FROM THE NEW OBJECTIVE
DVORAK TECHNIQUE (ODT). THESE RAW NUMBERS HAVE BEEN OSCILLATING
AROUND 5.0 AND 6.0.  THE CLOUD PATTERN IS EXCELLENT AND CONSISTS OF
A DISTINCT EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A CDO...WELL DEFINED CURVED BANDS AND
OUTFLOW IN ALL QUADRANTS. DARBY HAS AT LEAST 24 MORE HOURS OVER WARM
WATERS...SO ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS POSSIBLE.  THEREAFTER... THE
HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO CROSS THE 25 DEGREE ISOTHERM AND WEAKENING
SHOULD BEGIN.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WEAKENS THE HURRICANE IN
AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS MODEL BUT SLOWER THAN SHIFOR AND MUCH SLOWER
THAN THE GFDL.  THE GFDL WEAKENS DARBY TO A 50-KNOT STORM IN ABOUT
36 HOURS. 
 
DARBY...LIKE MOST OF THE EASTERN PACIFIC HURRICANES IS MOVING AT
290/10.  SINCE THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE
...THIS MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH 72 HOURS. THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH GUIDANCE.

DARBY HAS LIKELY BEEN UNDERGOING A CONCENTRIC EYEWALL PHASE AS
SUGGESTED BY INFRARED AND MICROWAVE DATA.  ANALYSES FROM THE

DARBY IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT SKILLS IN
PREDICTING INTENSITY CHANGES ARE LOW.  THIS IS DIFFICULT PROBLEM
THAT BOTH OPERATIONAL AND RESEARCH COMMUNITIES ARE TRYING TO
OVERCOME.  HURRICANE SPECIALISTS AND EVERY AVAILABLE MODEL...RANGING
FROM THE SIMPLE SHIFOR TO THE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED STATE OF THE ART
GFDL...FORECAST WEAKENING.
 
DARBY DID NOT WEAKEN AS FORECAST AND IN FACT...IT COULD BE A LITTLE
BIT STRONGER TODAY IF THE NEW OBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS ARE CONSIDERED.
THESE NUMBERS ARE PEAKING AROUND A 6.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE.
HOWEVER...MORE RELIABLE SUBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS FROM SAB AND TAFB
REMAIN ABOUT 5.5 GIVING AN INTENSITY OF ABOUT 100 KNOTS.  THE
HURRICANE HAS A DISTINCT AND LARGE EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A WELL
DEFINED CDO BUT WITHOUT BANDING FEATURES.  DARBY IS MOVING PARALLEL
TO THE 25 DEGREE SST ISOTHERM SO ONLY A SLOW WEAKENING IS INDICATED
AND AS SUGGESTED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.    

DARBY IS MOVING AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A STRONG DEEP LAYER MEAN
ANTICYCLONE WHICH IS FORECAST TO PERSIST.  THEREFORE...NO
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TRACK IS FORECAST DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36
HOURS.  THEREAFTER...AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED AND A SMALL TURN
TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED AS SUGGESTED BY MOST OF THE
GUIDANCE.  ON THIS TRACK...IN ABOUT 48 TO 60 HOURS...DARBY WILL BE
CROSSING 140 DEGREES WEST...MOVING INTO THE HONOLULU AREA OF

CONVECTIVE TOPS HAVE WARMED OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS OR SO...BUT DARBY
REMAINS VERY WELL-ORGANIZED WITH A WELL-DEFINED EYE ESTIMATED TO BE
ABOUT 25 N MI IN DIAMETER.  THUS FAR...DARBY HAS KEPT FAR ENOUGH TO
THE SOUTH SO AS TO AVOID THE STRONGER VERTICAL SHEAR NEAR 20N
LATITUDE.   THE HURRICANE APPARENTLY UNDERWENT AN EYEWALL
REPLACEMENT CYCLE OVER THE PAST 24 TO 36 HOURS...LEADING TO THE
SECOND PEAK IN INTENSITY.  IT IS NOT CERTAIN WHETHER THE SYSTEM WILL
GO THROUGH ANOTHER SUCH CYCLE OR NOT.  THIS LIKELY DEPENDS ON HOW
MUCH LONGER THE ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC ENVIRONMENT REMAIN
FAVORABLE.  SINCE THE CURRENT TREND SUGGESTS SLOW WEAKENING...AND
EYEWALL CYCLES ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORETELL...GRADUAL WEAKENING
IS PREDICTED AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY PACKAGE.

THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE MOTION OR THE TRACK
FORECAST.  STEERING WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE DOMINATED BY A DEEP-
LAYER MEAN RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF DARBY...ALONG ABOUT 27N LATITUDE. 
THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS THIS RIDGE EXTENDING THROUGH
145W LONGITUDE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

8 PM PDT MON JUL 27 1998

DARBY CONSISTS OF A LARGE EYE SURROUNDED BY AN EYEWALL AND NO
BANDING FEATURES. T-NUMBERS ARE ALREADY DECREASING BUT DARBY REMAINS
AS 100-KNOT HURRICANE AS INDICATED BY CI NUMBERS.  IT APPEARS THAT
THE WEAKENING PROCESS SHOULD BEGIN SOON. 

NOTHING HAS CHANGED...THE SAME STEERING PATTERN...AND THE SAME
MOTION...275/13.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS TURN DARBY MORE TO THE
WEST-NORTHWEST BEYOND 48 HOURS AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. 
DARBY IS EXPECTED TO CROSS 140W AND MOVE INTO THE HONOLULU AREA OF
RESPONSIBILITY IN A DAY OR SO.

HURRICANE DARBY DISCUSSION NUMBER  21
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT TUE JUL 28 1998

THE EYE IS BECOMING DIFFUSE AND OVERALL DARBY LOOKS WEAKER THAN IT
WAS 24 HOURS AGO.  CURRENT MAXIMUM WINDS ARE REDUCED TO 90 KNOTS. 
THE HURRICANE IS CURRENTLY CROSSING THE 25 DEG C SST ISOTHERM AND
FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY.  THE RATE OF WEAKENING WILL LIKELY
INCREASE LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL
SHEAR.

THE DIRECTION OF MOTION HAS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY MORE TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST BUT NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS MADE TO THE TRACK FORECAST
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  DARBY SHOULD BE NEARING THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF A DEEP-LAYER MEAN RIDGE IN A FEW DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS QUITE CLOSE TO THE LATEST GFDL MODEL GUIDANCE.

DARBY HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN THIS MORNING WITH CONVECTION HAVING
DECREASED IN BOTH COVERAGE AND INTENSITY.  MOREOVER...THE EYE IS 
NO LONGER DISCERNIBLE IN INFRARED SATELLITE PICTURES.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS DECREASED TO 85 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY IN LINE WITH
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB.  THE INTENSITY
FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE WITH GRADUAL
WEAKENING THROUGH THE PERIOD AS THE SYSTEM ENCOUNTERS COOLER
WATERS AND INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR.  THE STRONGER
UPPER-LEVEL SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW IS EVIDENT NEAR 140W IN
SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND ANALYSES BY THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES.  
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/14 KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK CONTINUES A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH THE PERIOD
...AND IS SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  DARBY
SHOULD BE CROSSING 140W WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS...BRINGING IT INTO
THE CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES THIS AFTERNOON SHOW THAT THE STRATOCUMULUS
CLOUD FIELD WEST OF DARBY IS BECOMING INVOLVED WITH THE WESTERN
FLANK OF THE SYSTEM.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DECREASE IN THE
AREAL COVERAGE OF DEEP CONVECTION.  THE CURRENT INTENSITY IS LOWERED
TO 75 KNOTS...IN LINE WITH CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...
SAB AND KGWC.  THE WEAKENING TREND OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WILL 
BE ACCELERATED SOMEWHAT BRINGING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS
WITHIN 12 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE SYSTEM SHOULD CONTINUE TO UNWIND
AS IT MOVES INTO INCREASING SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR AND
PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATERS. 
 
SATELLITE FIXES DURING THE DAY SUGGEST THAT DARBY IS MOVING ON A
SLIGHTLY MORE WESTERLY TRACK...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE
IS ADJUSTED TO 280/14 KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM IS NEARING THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF THE DEEP-LAYER MEAN RIDGE WITH A MORE NORTHERLY
COMPONENT OF MOTION EXPECTED BY 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK CALLS FOR A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION BEYOND 24 HOURS
AND IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH BAM SHALLOW...THE GFDL...AND THE
AVIATION TRACK GUIDANCE.

THE CURRENT FORECAST BRINGS DARBY TO 140W...DENOTING THE CENTRAL
PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY....LATER TODAY.

HURRICANE DARBY DISCUSSION NUMBER  24
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT TUE JUL 28 1998
 
DARBY CONTINUES TO WEAKEN...IN PART DUE TO SLOWLY COOLING WATERS
ALONG THE TRACK AND IN PART TO INCREASING SHEAR.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY NOW SHOWS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW/TROUGH TO THE WEST GREATLY
DISTORTING DARBY/S MOISTURE PATTERN WITH AN ELONGATED PLUME HEADING
NORTHWARD.  DEEP CONVECTION...AS MEASURED BY TOPS LOWER THAN -50C...
IS RAPIDLY DIMINISHING.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED
AT 70 KT.  INITIAL MOTION IS NEAR 285/16 KT.
 
DARBY APPEARS TO BE ROUNDING THE WESTERN EXTENSION OF THE RIDGE AND
SHOULD CONTINUE TO GAIN IN NORTHWARD COMPONENT...UNTIL IT WEAKENS TO
THE POINT OF BEING STEERED BY THE LOW-LEVEL CURRENT IN A DAY OR TWO.
THE NHC TRACK IS PARALLEL TO BAMM FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS AND THEN
PARALLEL TO BAMS THEREAFTER.
 
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS NOW CROSSING 140W AND ENTERING THE CENTRAL
PACIFIC HURRICANE BASIN.  FUTURE INFORMATION ON THIS SYSTEM WILL BE
PROVIDED BY THE NWS CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER IN HAWAII.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIX-E DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT WED JUL 29 1998
 
AN AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER CENTERED ABOUT 150 NMI SOUTH-SOUTHWEST
OF ACAPULCO MEXICO HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY AND IS BEING
UPGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIX-E.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/06 AND IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN SINCE
THE CIRCULATION HAS BEEN TRACKED FOR ONLY ABOUT 12 HOURS OLD.  THE
MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES A RIDGE WILL PERSIST TO THE NORTH OF THE
DEPRESSION CAUSING IT TO MOVE ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD TRACK
FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS
REASONING.
 
THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF STRONG VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ALONG THE FORECAST
TRACK AND GRADUAL STRENGTHENING TO 60 KNOTS IN 72 HOURS IS FORECAST.
THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL CALLS FOR HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 48 HOURS
BUT SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THE DEEP CONVECTION TO BE WEAKENING AT
PRESENT.  SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE SHIPS
MODEL.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH TAFB MIAMI AND SAB
WASHINGTON ARE AT 35 KNOTS...SUPPORTING THE UPGRADING OF THE SYSTEM
SOUTH OF MANZANILLO MEXICO TO TROPICAL STORM ESTELLE.  THE CYCLONE
CONTINUES TO DEVELOP...WITH CONSIDERABLE DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE
ESTIMATED CENTER AND BANDING FEATURES TRYING TO TAKE SHAPE OVER THE
NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST QUADRANTS.   WITH WEAK VERTICAL SHEAR OVER
THE AREA AND SST/S IN THE 28-29 DEG C RANGE...FURTHER STRENGTHENING
SEEMS INEVITABLE.

THE CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS WESTWARD AT 10-11 KNOTS.  THERE IS A
LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH DRAPED ACROSS THE AREA NORTH OF ESTELLE.
CONSEQUENTLY THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS THE CURRENT WESTWARD
MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS IS ALSO IN GENERAL
AGREEMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS...AND ONLY
SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.

8 AM PDT THU JUL 30 1998

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB MIAMI AND SAB INDICATE THAT
THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS OF ESTELLE HAVE INCREASED TO 45 KNOTS.
THE SYSTEM APPEARS WELL ORGANIZED WITH STRONG CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER. THE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK
REMAIN ABOVE 28 DEG C FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS AND THE STORM IS LOCATED
SOUTH OF AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE. THEREFORE FAIRLY RAPID
INTENSIFICATION IS PREDICTED...IN AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME (SHIPS).  
 
THE CURRENT MOTION IS WESTWARD ABOUT 10 KNOTS AND THIS GENERAL
MOTION IS EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE AVN RUN
INDICATES THAT ESTELLE WILL REMAIN SOUTH OF THE UPPER LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS. A SLIGHT INCREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED IS EXPECTED AS ESTELLE MOVES TO THE SOUTH OF THE RIDGE AXIS.
THIS MOTION IS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.

ESTELLE CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED WITH SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 55 KNOTS FROM TAFB MIAMI AND SAB. DEEP
CONVECTION IS OCCURRING ON ALL SIDES OF THE SYSTEM AND THE
PRESENTATION ON THE VISIBLE IMAGE IS IMPRESSIVE. THE STORM SHOULD
REMAIN OVER WARM WATER AND SOUTH OF AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE
THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD SO THE CURRENT STRENGTHENING TREND IS
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. 

THE PREDICTED TRACK HAS CHANGED LITTLE SINCE THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.
THE WEST TO WEST NORTHWEST MOTION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR THE
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE BAM AND GFDL MODELS SUGGEST A SOMEWHAT SLOWER
MOTION THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. THE FORECAST TRACK IS MORE
CONSISTENT WITH THE STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL MODEL NHC91 WHICH HAS
PERFORMED WELL IN THE EAST PACIFIC SO FAR THIS SEASON.

ESTELLE IS LARGE TROPICAL CYCLONE AND HAS CONTINUED TO INTENSIFY. T-
NUMBERS ARE OSCILLATING AROUND 5.0 AND 5.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE. AN
EYE IS CLEARLY OBSERVED ON IR IMAGES AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF BANDING
FEATURES. WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 95 KNOTS. FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS
INDICATED EXCEPT SOME WEAKENING BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD
WHEN ESTELLE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER COOLER WATERS.

INITIAL MOTION IS 270/13. THERE IS A PERSISTENT AND SOLID DEEP LAYER
MEAN RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ESTELLE. THIS PATTERN WILL SUGGEST A
GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS. THIS IN GOOD

THE INTENSIFICATION TREND HAS...AT LEAST TEMPORARILY...CEASED.  THE
EYE HAS BECOME ILL-DEFINED ON INFRARED IMAGERY AND THERE IS AN
EROSION OF THE COLD CLOUD TOPS OVER THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE

FLUCTUATION OR THE BEGINNING OF A LONG-TERM WEAKENING TREND.
ESTELLE IS CURRENTLY CROSSING THE 27 DEG C SST ISOTHERM...SO FURTHER
WEAKENING SEEMS PLAUSIBLE.  HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES...
THE CURRENT INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS A RELATIVELY SLOW DECAY.  LATE
IN THE PERIOD...SEA TEMPS COULD BE NEAR 24 DEG C SO ESTELLE MIGHT BE
CONSIDERABLY WEAKER THAN SHOWN HERE.
 
GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS INDICATE THAT A WELL-ESTABLISHED MID-

ESTELLE HAS SLOWED ITS FORWARD MOTION CONSIDERABLY IN COMPARISON TO
LAST NIGHT.  CURRENT ESTIMATE IS SET AT 12 KNOTS...AND AFTER JOGGING
A LITTLE TO THE WEST-SOUTHWEST...IT IS MOVING WESTWARD AGAIN.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED TO ACCOMMODATE THE SLOWER
INITIAL MOTION...BUT CONTINUES TOWARD THE WEST.  THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN WHICH SHOWS A LARGE MID-LEVEL
RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ESTELLE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 

ONLY A SMALL AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION IS FOUND...OVER THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE CYCLONE.  CURRENT DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB
AND SAB AGREE AT 55 KNOTS.  CONTINUED GRADUAL WEAKENING DUE TO
COOLER WATERS AND A MORE STABLE ATMOSPHERE IS EXPECTED.

THERE HAS BEEN A FURTHER SLOWING OF THE FORWARD MOTION OF ESTELLE...
TO NEAR 10 KNOTS...STILL TOWARD THE WEST.  CONSEQUENTLY THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST HAS BEEN SLOWED JUST A BIT MORE BUT OTHERWISE IS BASICALLY
UNCHANGED.  
 
DEEP CONVECTION HAS PRACTICALLY VANISHED AT THIS TIME.  CURRENT
INTENSITY NUMBER IS 3.0 FROM BOTH THE TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER AND
THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE DATA INFORMATION SERVICE...
CORRESPONDING TO A WIND SPEED OF 45 KNOTS.  EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A
LARGE...WELL-DEFINED CIRCULATION...AND WILL BE RATHER SLOW TO SPIN
DOWN...ESTELLE SHOULD BE REDUCED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION IN A DAY
OR TWO AND DISSIPATING AROUND THE END OF THE PERIOD.

THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS POORLY ORGANIZED AND APPEARS TO BE

CONFIRMED BY A FEW SHIP REPORTS WITH WINDS BLOWING AWAY FROM THE
CIRCULATION.  CONVECTION IS LIMITED AND DISORGANIZED AND T-NUMBERS

ENOUGH OF A SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN A 25-KNOT DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME BUT
THE SYSTEM COULD DEGENERATE INTO A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE.  

THE ENVIRONMENT IS CLIMATOLOGICALLY FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING IN
THIS BASIN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EFFECTS OF COOL WATERS.  SO...I
WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF CONVECTION REDEVELOPS AND WINDS INCREASE
SOME.  THIS STRENGTHENING MUST OCCUR SOON BECAUSE AFTER 24
HOURS...THE DEPRESSION WILL LIKELY MOVE OVER 25 DEGREE WATER AND
RAPID WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 325/09. THIS TRACK IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WITH A

WINDS SOUTH AT 25 KNOTS...WITH 1008.7 MB FOLLOWING A 3 HR PRESSURE
RISE OF 3.1 MB.  ALSO AT 18Z...WINDS OF 20 KT AND 33 KT WERE
REPORTED BY TWO SHIPS NOT FAR FROM EACH OTHER ABOUT 130 NMI TO THE
NE OF THE CENTER IN THE VICINITY OF A CONVECTIVE BAND.
 
THE 12Z AVN IS SIMILAR TO THE 06Z RUN...WITH A WEAKNESS IN THE
HEIGHT PATTERN TO THE NW AND A FORECAST TRACK IN THAT DIRECTION. 
THE AVN BASED GUIDANCE HAS MOSTLY NW TRACKS.  THE NHC FORECAST IS
AGAIN TO THE RIGHT OF ALL THAT GUIDANCE AND FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE 00Z
NOGAPS.  OUR TRACK IS SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS NHC
FORECAST.
 
THE SYSTEM COULD REMAIN OVER RELATIVELY WARM WATERS FOR THE NEXT DAY
OR TWO...AND IS NOW FORECAST TO REACH TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  A
TROPICAL STORM WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO FOR
THE SOUTHERN PART OF BAJA CALIFORNIA. 
 
RAINFALL OVER BAJA CALIFORNIA COULD INDUCE FLASH FLOODS AND MUD
SLIDES.

VISIBLE AND INFRARED SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM HAS
GOTTEN BETTER ORGANIZED IN THE PAST 6 HOURS.  TAFB NOTES A FOUR
TENTHS BANDING FEATURE ON THE BD CURVE AND HAS A T NUMBER OF 2.5. 
SAB IS STILL GIVING A T NUMBER OF 2.0  AT 2100 AND OOOO UTC SEVERAL
SHIPS PASSING ABOUT 100 NM TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER REPORTED
25 TO 33 KNOTS OF WIND.  BASED ON THIS WE ARE UPGRADING THE
DEPRESSION TO TROPICAL STORM FRANK WITH MAXIMUM WINDS OF 35 KNOTS.
THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO INTENSIFY SLIGHTLY AND THAN DECREASE AS IT
MOVES OVER COOLER WATERS IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO.

FRANK IS MOVING ABOUT 360/07.  THIS INITIAL MOTION AND OUR TRACK
FORECAST WILL BRING THE STORM APPROXIMATELY PARALLEL TO THE BAJA
PENINSULA AND WOULD KEEP THE STRONGEST WINDS JUST OFFSHORE. 
HOWEVER...A SLIGHT TURN BACK TO THE NORTH COULD BRING THE SYSTEM
INLAND OVER BAJA.  THUS THE TROPICAL STORM WATCH WILL REMAIN IN
EFFECT AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY MAY BE CHANGED TO TROPICAL STORM
WARNINGS LATER TONIGHT OR TOMORROW.
 
MOST TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO TURN THE SYSTEM TOWARD THE
WEST-NORTHWEST OR NORTHWEST.  HOWEVER THE NAVY NOGAPS AND LBAR MODEL
TRACKS DO PARALLEL THE COASTLINE.  THE NHC FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND VERY CLOSE TO THE NAVY NOGAPS TRACK
FORECAST.
 
RAINFALL OVER BAJA CALIFORNIA COULD INDUCE FLASH FLOODS AND MUD

2 AM PDT SAT AUG 08 1998

SATELLITE...SURFACE AND RADAR OBSERVATIONS FROM MEXICO INDICATE THAT
FRANK IS MOVING NORTHWARD ABOUT 11 KNOTS.  FRANK IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO
THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA THAT TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS 
MAY REACH A PORTION OF THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA. THEREFORE
... A TROPICAL STORM WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED FROM CABO SAN LAZARO TO
PUNTA ABREOJOS.  SINCE THE STORM IS FORECAST TO MOVE PARALLEL TO
BAJA CALIFORNIA...A TROPICAL STORM WATCH HAS BEEN EXTENDED
NORTHWARD TO PUNTA EUGENIA.  

A WEAKNESS OF THE 500 MB HIGH TO THE NORTHWEST OF FRANK IS CAUSING
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO MOVE NORTHWARD. BECAUSE THE MODELS BUILD THE
RIDGE ONCE AGAIN IN 24 TO 36 HOURS...A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST
IS FORECAST.  THIS NORTHWEST TRACK IS REFLECTED IN MOST OF THE TRACK
MODELS.

THERE IS AN AREA OF DEEP AND CIRCULAR CONVECTION OVER THE CENTER OF
THE TROPICAL STORM AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 2.5 FROM
BOTH TSAF AND SAB.  WINDS ARE KEPT AT 35 KNOTS BUT FRANK COULD
STRENGTHEN SOME BEFORE REACHING COOL WATERS IN 24 HOURS. 
 
RAINFALL OVER PORTIONS OF BAJA CALIFORNIA COULD INDUCE FLASH FLOODS

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 350/10.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWS A
TURN TOWARD THE WEST IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO EXCEPT FOR LBAR AND THE
DEEP BAM WHICH MOVE THE STORM NORTHWEST AND THEN NORTHWARD.  THE 00Z

THE STORM AND MOVES THIS SYSTEM MOSTLY WESTWARD WHILE REBUILDING A
RIDGE TO THE NORTH.  THIS INITIALIZATION MAY NOT BE VERY ACCURATE. 
IN ANY CASE...THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY SHOWING A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND DECELERATION.  

DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES KEEP FRANK AT MINIMAL STORM STRENGTH...
35 KNOTS.  THERE ARE COLD SSTS ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK AND
WEAKENING IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.

THE FORECAST TRACK KEEPS THE CENTER WITHIN ABOUT 50 NAUTICAL MILES
OF THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND IT IS
RECOMMENDED THAT TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS NOW BE ISSUED FROM PUNTA
TOSCA TO PUNTA EUGENIA.

THERE IS AN OUTER RAINBAND LOCATED OVER THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA.

FUTURE INTENSITY OF SYSTEM POTENTIALLY GOVERNED BY SEVERAL FACTORS. 
CURRENTLY...THE TD SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE UNDER NORTHEASTERLY
SHEAR...WITH BAM GUIDANCE IMPLYING STRONG NW SHEAR BY THE END OF THE

TO NORTH MOVEMENT BUT THIS IS PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SPURIOUS
VORTEX INITIALIZED ABOUT 7 DEG WEST OF GEORGETTE.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST KEEPS A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST THEN NORTHWEST MOTION BY
72 HOURS.  THIS IS MIDWAY BETWEEN BAM DEEP AND LBAR...AND IS ON

SATELLITE IMAGES EARLY THIS EVENING SHOW THAT GEORGETTE HAS
CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN.  T-NUMBERS ARE 3.0/3.0/2.5 FROM
TAFB/GLOBAL/SAB RESPECTIVELY. INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 45 KNOTS. 
THE OUTFLOW OVER THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE CONTINUES TO BE HINDERED BY
THE DEVELOPING UPPER-LEVEL LOW NORTH OF THE SYSTEM AS SEEN IN THE
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR STRENGTHENING
TO HURRICANE IN 24 HOURS BUT LITTLE CHANGE AFTER THAT...IN LINE WITH
SHIPS AND GFDL GUIDANCE.
 
GEORGETTE IS INTERACTING WITH THE DEVELOPING UPPER LEVEL LOW TO THE
NORTH OF THE SYSTEM.  THE SYSTEM HAS SLOWED TO ABOUT 5 KNOTS AND IS
CONTINUING TO TAKE ON MORE OF A NORTHERLY COMPONENT IN DIRECTION
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 305/05.  THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO MOVE WESTWARD.  LATEST GUIDANCE FROM THE
BAMD...GFDL...NAVY NOGAPS AND P91 MODELS SUGGEST A SLOW FORWARD
MOTION UNTIL THE UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES TO THE WEST AND THEN AN
INCREASE IN FORWARD MOTION AND A MOVEMENT TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED TRACKS AND IS
SOMEWHAT TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

THE TRACK HAS EDGED A LITTLE MORE TO THE RIGHT...315/7 KT...
PRESUMABLY IN RESPONSE TO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GEORGETTE AND THE
UPPER-LEVEL LOW NOW CENTERED ABOUT 500 NM TO THE NORTH.  GEORGETTE
HAS A SMALL...BUT GROWING...SPOT OF DEEP CONVECTION AT THE ESTIMATED
CENTER OF CIRCULATION AND A STRONG BAND OF CONVECTION THAT WRAPS
INTO THE CENTER FROM THE SW-S-E-N.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
SUPPORT INCREASING THE WIND SPEED TO 50 KT.  A SHIP ABOUT 160 NM NE
OF THE CENTER REPORTED 25 KT WINDS AND 15 FT SEAS AT 0600 UTC.
 
THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST HAD THE TRACK OF GEORGETTE WRAPPING AROUND
THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE UPPER LOW...WHICH THE AVN FORECASTS WILL
CONTINUE TO MOVE WESTWARD.  THE 00Z GFDL AND AVN HAVE SIMILAR
SOLUTIONS TO THAT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS...SHOWING A TURN TOWARD THE
NORTH AND THEN AN ACCELERATION BACK TOWARD THE NW.  IT IS NOT
CLEAR...HOWEVER...WHETHER THEY DO SO BECAUSE OF THE UPPER LOW OR...
INSTEAD...BECAUSE OF A RESIDUAL MODEL VORTEX INITIALIZED BY THE AVN
NEAR 12N 119W.  THE NHC FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE OFFICIAL TRACK OF
6 HOURS AGO AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE...BETWEEN GFDL AND

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT WED AUG 12 1998
 
GEORGETTE HAS CONTINUED TO INTENSIFY THIS MORNING WITH A WELL-
DEFINED BANDING FEATURE WRAPPING AROUND THE SYSTEM.  THE OVERALL
CLOUD PATTERN HAS IMPROVED MARKEDLY OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.  
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB ARE NOW 4.0...65 KNOTS...
AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 65 KNOTS.  THIS MAKES
GEORGETTE THE 4TH HURRICANE OF THE EAST PACIFIC SEASON.  THE
INTENSITY FORECAST CONTINUES THE STRENGTHENING TREND THROUGH 
24 HOURS...WITH A GRADUAL WEAKENING BEYOND 48 HOURS AS THE
SYSTEM ENCOUNTERS 23/24C WATERS.  THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH
THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME (SHIPS). 

A SHIP LOCATED ABOUT 180NM NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER REPORTED A SSE
WIND OF 25 KNOTS AND SEAS OF 15 FT.  ACCORDINGLY...THE TROPICAL
STORM-FORCE WIND AND 12-FOOT SEA RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED.
 
SATELLITE PICTURES THIS MORNING SUGGEST THAT GEORGETTE/S FORWARD
MOTION HAS INCREASED...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 310/
10 KNOTS.  THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW LOCATED ABOUT 460NM NORTH OF THE
SYSTEM CONTINUES TO MOVE WESTWARD...AS FORECAST BY THE AVIATION
MODEL.  THIS SHOULD KEEP GEORGETTE ON A MORE NW TRACK HEADING.  
MOST OF THE 12Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWEST
MOTION...AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST REFLECTS THIS.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BAM DEEP AND NHC91.  THIS
REPRESENTS A SLIGHT LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

GEORGETTE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A BANDING-TYPE HURRICANE.  THE SYSTEM
HAS A LARGE ENVELOPE AS INDICATED BY SATELLITE IMAGERY AND SURFACE
SHIP REPORTS.  A SHIP LOCATED ABOUT 205 NMI NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER
...ID KGTI...REPORTED AN E WIND OF 20 KNOTS AND SEAS OF 16 FT. 
BASED ON THIS DATA THE TROPICAL STORM-FORCE WIND AND 12-FOOT SEA
RADII HAS BEEN MODIFIED.  

DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE IN AGREEMENT...
AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 70 KNOTS FOR THIS
ADVISORY. WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED OUTFLOW AND NO OBVIOUS FACTORS TO
HINDER DEVELOPMENT...GEORGETTE IS FORECAST TO GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN
THROUGH 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A GRADUAL WEAKENING TREND SHOULD
BEGIN AS THE SYSTEM APPROACHES PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATERS...NEAR 
22 DEG C BY 72 HOURS.
 
GEORGETTE HAS CONTINUED ON A NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH THE DAY.  
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/11 KNOTS.  THE MID- TO UPPER-
LEVEL LOW POSITIONED ABOUT 450 NMI NORTH OF GEORGETTE CONTINUES 
TO MOVE WESTWARD WITH A RIDGE BUILDING TO ITS EAST.  THIS SYSTEM 
IS HAVING LITTLE IMPACT ON THE HURRICANE...PER WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
...AND IS FORECAST TO WEAKEN.  THE 18Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS 
MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED AROUND A GENERAL NORTHWEST TRACK MOTION.

GEORGETTE CONTINUES AS A BANDING TYPE HURRICANE WITH AN EXCELLENT
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW. THE EYE IS NOT OBSERVED ON SATELLITE IMAGES YET
BUT T-NUMBERS FROM SAB AND TAFB HAVE INCREASED TO 4.5 ON THE DVORAK
SCALE.  THE WINDS ARE THEN ADJUSTED TO 75 KNOTS IN THIS ADVISORY.
CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST DURING THE NEXT 36 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...A GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN AS THE HURRICANE MOVES
OVER COOLER WATER.

INITIAL MOTION IS 305/12.   MOST OF THE MODELS ARE SUGGESTING THAT
THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE WILL EXPAND WESTWARD.
THEREFORE...THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  TRACK MODELS...INCLUDING THE LATEST GFDL SUGGEST A GRADUAL
TURN MORE TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST AS THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH
BECOMES BETTER ESTABLISHED...AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL

THE EYE IS QUITE LARGE...30-35 NMI IN DIAMETER AND IS SURROUNDED BY
A SOLID RING OF DEEP CONVECTION.  INTERESTINGLY...THERE IS ALMOST NO
VERY DEEP CONVECTION ELSEWHERE.  THE WIND SPEED IS AGAIN ESTIMATED
TO BE 100 KT AS IMPLIED BY THE 5.5 TAFB AND SAB T-NUMBERS. GEORGETTE
TOOK A JOG TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS.  IT HAS COME BACK A LITTLE BUT A SMOOTHED VERSION OF ITS
MOTION SINCE LAST EVENING GIVES A HEADING OF ABOUT 315 DEGREES AT 13
KT.  THE WIND AND 12 FT SEAS RADII NW OF CENTER HAVE BEEN EXPANDED
BASED ON THE OBSERVATIONS FROM SHIP KGTI AT 03Z AND 06Z.
 
IT IS HARD TO RECONCILE THE RECENT MOTION WITH FEATURES ANALYZED IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OR SHOWN IN THE 00Z AVN INITIALIZATION.  THERE
DOES APPEAR TO BE A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATION...
PERHAPS CLOSED...TO THE NNW OF THE HURRICANE.  IT MIGHT BE RELATED
TO THE VORTEX NOTED IN PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS AND THE CIRCULATION ON
THE SE SIDE OF IT COULD BE HELPING TO ACCELERATE GEORGETTE ON A MORE
NORTHWARD HEADING.  THIS MIGHT BE TEMPORARY.  OTHERWISE...THE AVN
LARGE-SCALE PATTERN IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS RUNS.  THE TRACK
MODELS COVER THE HEADINGS FROM W TO NW AND HAVE SUBSTANTIAL
DIFFERENCES IN SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A SLOW BEND BACK
TOWARD WNW AND GRADUAL DECELERATION.
 
THE CENTER OF GEORGETTE WILL BE CROSSING THE 25C SST ISOTHERM TOWARD

HURRICANE GEORGETTE DISCUSSION NUMBER  15
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT FRI AUG 14 1998
 
DVORAK T NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 4.5 BUT THE CURRENT INTENSITY
NUMBERS REMAIN AT 5.5 OR NEAR 100 KNOTS.  THE WIND SPEED IS
DECREASED TO 95 KNOTS AT 21Z BASED ON A WEAKENING TREND AND COLD
SSTS ARE EXPECTED TO WEAKEN GEORGETTE TO A DEPRESSION BY 72 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 315/15.  SOME OF THE MODEL
GUIDANCE...INCLUDING THE DEEP BAM...THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL
P91E...AND THE LBAR...SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH INTO A WEAKNESS
IN THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE.  HOWEVER GEORGETTES
EXPECTED WEAKENING SHOULD RESULT IN A MORE WESTWARD STEERING BY THE
LOWER LEVEL FLOW AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS FOR A GRADUAL
MORE WESTWARD MOTION ALONG WITH SOME DECELERATION...SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

A SHIP REPORT OF 20 KNOTS AT A POSITION ABOUT 80 NMI NORTHEAST OF
THE CENTER AT 18Z SUGGESTS THAT THE 34-KNOT WIND SPEED RADIUS OF 175
NMI IS TOO LARGE.  HOWEVER THE SAME SHIP HAD RATHER HIGH SEAS AND
COULD BE BETWEEN CONVECTIVE BANDS.  SO THE RADIUS IS LEFT AT 175
MILES IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT UNTIL THERE IS ADDITIONAL
CONFIRMATION OF A SMALLER RADIUS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT FRI AUG 14 1998

GEORGETTE IS MOVING OVER INCREASING COOLER WATERS...ALREADY OVER 23
DEGREES CELSIUS.  THEREFORE...RAPID WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN.  THE EYE
IS DISAPPEARING AND CONVECTION IS DECREASING QUICKLY. HOWEVER... NO
SURPRISE IF CONVECTION TEMPORARILY REDEVELOPS DURING THE NEXT 12 TO
24 HOURS.  T-NUMBERS STILL SUPPORT 85 TO 90 KNOTS SINCE DVORAK RULES
DO NOT PERMIT SUCH A FAST WEAKENING.  GEORGETTE IS LIKELY TO BE A
SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS IN 24 TO 36 HOURS AND PROBABLY WILL BE DECLARED
DISSIPATED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 315/14. THIS GENERAL TRACK IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  A TURN MORE TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST IS
FORECAST AS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WEAKENS AND BECOMES STEERED BY THE
LOW-LEVEL FLOW.  TRACK MODELS ARE DIVERGENT BEYOND 36 HOURS WITH
MOTIONS EITHER SLOW OR FAST AND TRACKS TO THE NORTHEAST...NORTH AND
WEST. THE BEST OPTION IS TO USE BAM-SHALLOW WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF
THE LOW-LEVEL STEERING AND ITS PROBABLY APPROPRIATE FOR A RAPID
WEAKENING SYSTEM.

DEEP CONVECTION IS DIMINISHING IN COVERAGE AND IT IS BECOMING
DIFFICULT TO DISCERN AN EYE ON IR IMAGERY.  WHILE DVORAK CI NUMBERS
AT 06 UTC WERE 5.0 FROM TAFB AND SAB...GEORGETTE IS EXPECTED TO
QUICKLY WEAKEN OVER COOLER WATERS DURING THE WEEKEND.  THE HURRICANE
CONTINUES MOVING TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AT ABOUT 13 KNOTS.
 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A CYCLONIC CIRCULATION CENTER ABOUT 500 NM
NW WEST OF GEORGETTE AND THIS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO A CONTINUATION OF
THE CURRENT HEADING FOR ANOTHER DAY OR SO.  THEREAFTER...GEORGETTE
IS EXPECTED TO BE MUCH WEAKENED AND MORE LIKELY STEERED BY LOWER

GEORGETTE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN OVER PROGRESSIVELY COLDER SSTS AND
THERE IS LITTLE DEEP CONVECTION REMAINING NEAR THE CENTER.  GALE

A SMALL AREA OF CONVECTION HAS INCREASED A LITTLE NEAR WHERE
EXTRAPOLATION AND CONTINUITY WOULD PLACE THE CENTER AT 18Z.  HOWEVER
A HOLE IN THE CLOUDS HAS RECENTLY APPEARED TO THE SOUTH.  THIS COULD
BE THE CENTER...NOT AN EYE...OR IT COULD BE A SUCKER HOLE.  A
COMPROMISE INITIAL POSITION IS SELECTED WHICH GIVES AN INITIAL
MOTION OF 305/10.  THIS RESULTS IN A CONTINUATION OF THE GRADUAL
SLOWING OF FORWARD SPEED AND A SLIGHT TURN TOWARD THE LEFT.  MOST OF

ONLY A FEW PATCHES OF WEAKENING CONVECTION TO THE NORTH OF THE
CENTER AT THIS TIME. LATEST ERS2 ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT WINDS ARE
AROUND 45 KNOTS WHILE DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE DECREASING.  THEREFORE
...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS ADJUSTED TO 45 KNOTS.  SINCE GEORGETTE
IS OVER COOL WATERS IT SHOULD WEAKEN TO AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE

AN EYE FEATURE HAS APPEARED IN SATELLITE IMAGERY THE LAST SEVERAL
HOURS AND INDICATES STRENGTHENING.  DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM 
TAFB AND SAB ARE 5.0 AND 4.5 RESPECTIVELY.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY
IS INCREASED TO 85 KNOTS.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST ALONG
THE LINES OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/12.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72 HOURS...AND
THE SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK.  THIS REPRESENTS A SLIGHT
LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII HAS BEEN ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY DUE
TO SEVERAL 06Z SHIP REPORTS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/12.  THE GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A
CONTINUATION OF THIS GENERAL MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE AVIATION
MODEL 00Z RUN SHOWS SOME WEAKENING OF THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE
HURRICANE SO THAT THERE COULD BE SOME SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED 
AND PERHAPS A SLIGHT TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
SHOWS SLIGHT DECELERATION AFTER ABOUT 48 HOURS.

WITH A WELL DEFINED EYE...THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 95 KNOTS
AND INTENSIFICATION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER 24 HOURS. 
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...SLIGHTLY COOLER SSTS COULD
START A WEAKENING TREND.

THROUGH ABOUT 36 HOURS.  AFTER THIS TIME GFDL AND NOGAPS MAKE A
GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE NORTH...WHILE ALL THE BAMS...UKMET...AND

INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 130 KNOTS.  THE FORECAST IS FOR SOME
FURTHER STRENGTHENING...FOLLOWED BY SLOW WEAKENING AFTER 12 HOURS AS

IS WHAT MOST OF THE GUIDANCE IS SHOWING FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THIS
SHIFTS THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS

NORTH COULD SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED AND MOVE THE HURRICANE A LITTLE
FURTHER NORTH.
 
THE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATE FROM TAFB IS T NUMBER 6.5 OR 127
KNOTS.  HOWEVER THE COLDEST TOPS HAVE WARMED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS
AND THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS DECREASED FROM 130 TO 125 KNOTS ON
THIS BASIS.  THE FORECAST WIND SPEEDS ARE DECREASED SOME FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY ALSO BECAUSE OF THE ABOVE SUGGESTION THAT THE

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW A LARGE EYE ASSOCIATED WITH HOWARD
SURROUNDED BY A RING OF DEEP CONVECTION BUT NO BANDING FEATURES. 
LOW LEVEL STRAT0-CUMULUS CLOUDS ARE BEING ADVECTED INTO HOWARD AND
THIS COMBINED WITH COOLER SSTS ARE BEGINNING TO WEAKEN THE SYSTEM. 
DVORAK T-NUMBERS HAVE ALL DECREASED TO 5.5.. SO INITIAL INTENSITY IS
SET AT 105 KTS. CONTINUED WEAKENING IS FORECAST. 
 
HOWARD HAS SLOWED DOWN SO THAT THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/08.  THE
MODEL ENSEMBLE GENERALLY TAKES THE SYSTEM TOWARD THE WEST-
NORTHWEST...ALSO AT A SLOWER PACE. THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS SLIGHTLY
SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND SOMEWHAT SLOWER.

HOWARD CONTINUES ITS SLOW DECLINE.  ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM STILL
HAS A WELL-DEFINED EYE...ABOUT 30 NM IN DIAMETER...THE SURROUNDING
CONVECTION HAS WEAKENED.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM BOTH
TAFB AND SAB ARE NOW 5.5...102 KNOTS.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
REDUCED TO 100 KNOTS.  THE GRADUAL WEAKENING TREND SHOULD CONTINUE
AS HOWARD APPROACHES COOLER WATER.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/09 KNOTS.  THE RIDGE NORTH OF HOWARD
SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  MOST OF THE DYNAMIC-
BASED MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS A WEST-NORTHEAST MOTION THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD.  A 24-HOUR SATELLITE LOOP SHOWS THAT HOWARD HAS BEEN ON
A GENERAL WESTWARD COURSE...NOTWITHSTANDING A WOBBLE OR TWO.
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST CALLS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING

SEMICIRCLE OF THE SYSTEM.  AVERAGING THE LATEST DVORAK SATELLITE
CLASSIFICATION INTENSITIES FROM TPC AND NESDIS YIELD A CURRENT
INTENSITY OF 60 KNOTS...SO HOWARD IS DOWNGRADED TO A STORM ON THIS
ADVISORY.  HOWARD IS MOVING INTO AN AREA OF MARGINAL SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES... AND SATELLITE-DERIVED ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN CIMSS SHOW INCREASED VERTICAL SHEAR AHEAD OF THE
CYCLONE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS STEADY WEAKENING AS IN
PREVIOUS PACKAGES.

THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN FORECASTS A LOW- TO MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO BUILD SOMEWHAT TO THE NORTH OF HOWARD.  ALSO
AS THE CYCLONE WEAKENS...IT SHOULD TEND TO BE STEERED MORE BY THE
FLOW IN THE LOWER HALF OF THE TROPOSPHERE.  HOWARD/S CURRENT

LARGE...MONSOON-LIKE...SYSTEM SOUTH OF BAJA CALIFORNIA...A SHIP
REPORTED 997 MB WHILE ANOTHER HAD 40 KT AT 18Z.  BASED ON THIS
SURFACE DATA...THE DISTURBANCE IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM ISIS
WITH 45 KT WINDS.  DUE TO THE LOOSE STRUCTURE THE INITIAL POSITION
AND MOVEMENT ARE UNCERTAIN.  CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 350/8 KT.
 
THE 06Z AND 12Z AVN MODEL RUNS TAKE ISIS NORTHWARD TOWARD SOUTHERN
BAJA CALIFORNIA AND THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA...ALTHOUGH PART OF THE
MOTION COULD HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY THE EXTRANEOUS MODEL VORTEX TO THE
WEST. THE UKMET OUTPUT FROM 12Z IS NOT TOO DIFFERENT...SHOWING ISIS
MOVING ALL THE WAY UP THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA WITHIN 3 DAYS.  OTHER
GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY SIMILAR...AS IS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST BUT THE AMOUNT OF INTENSIFICATION WILL BE
HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON HOW MUCH THE SYSTEM INTERACTS WITH LAND.
 
A TROPICAL STORM WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT FOR THE SOUTHERN PART OF
BAJA CALIFORNIA.

RADAR DATA FROM THE MEXICAN WEATHER SERVICE/S DOPPLER RADAR IN CABO
SAN LUCAS SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER OF TROPICAL STORM ISIS IS ABOUT
35 MILES SOUTHEAST OF CABO SAN LUCAS. MOREOVER...A SHIP OBSERVATION
WAS RECEIVED LOCATED JUST WEST OF THE ESTIMATED RADAR LOCATION
REPORTING NORTHEAST WINDS AT BEAUFORT FORCE 10...48-55
KNOTS...AND A 993 MB PRESSURE.  BASED ON THIS DATA...THE CENTER OF
ISIS IS BEING RE-LOCATED NORTHWARD AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS INCREASED TO 60 KNOTS. THIS INTENSITY WILL BE HELD
THROUGH 36 HOURS WITH GRADUAL WEAKENING THEREAFTER AS THE SYSTEM
BECOMES MORE INVOLVED WITH LAND. 

THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO IS EXTENDING THE TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS
ON THE BAJA PENINSULA SOUTH OF A LINE SANTA ROSALIA TO PUNTA
ABREAJOS....AND MAINLAND MEXICAN COAST FROM ELDORADO TO GUAYMAS. 

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 360/09 KNOTS.  ISIS SHOULD CONTINUE
MOVING NORTHWARD IN RESPONSE TO A MID-LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING
SOUTHWARD FROM THE SOUTHWEST U.S. INTO THE EASTERN PACIFIC.  MOST
OF THE 00Z TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWARD HEADING
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO....AND IS IN CLOSEST
AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL MODELS P91E AND P9UK.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT WED SEP 02 1998

A VERY LARGE SYMMETRICAL AREA OF VERY DEEP CONVECTION... TOPS TO 
-80C...HAS BEEN FIRING FOR THE LAST 3-4 HOURS AROUND THE SUSPECTED 
CENTER OF ISIS.  RECENTLY A BANDING-TYPE FEATURE HAS BECOME EVIDENT
SOUTH AND EAST OF THE CENTER ALONG THE COAST OF MEXICO TO NEAR
PUERTO VALLARTA.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 60 KNOTS
FOR THIS ADVISORY.  WITH THE FAIR TO POOR OUTFLOW AND THE SYSTEMS
PROXIMITY TO LAND NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST THROUGH 36
HOURS.  BEYOND 36 HOURS SOME GRADUAL WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS
ISIS BECOMES MORE INVOLVED WITH MAINLAND MEXICO.  

THE LAST AVAILABLE RADAR IMAGE FROM THE MEXICAN WEATHER SERVICE/S
DOPPLER RADAR IN CABO SAN LUCAS...AROUND 05Z...PLACED THE CENTER 
ABOUT 60-70 MILES SOUTHEAST OF CABO SAN LUCAS.  THIS POSITION
ESTIMATE IS CONFIRMED BY SSM/I...85GHZ IMAGERY OBTAINED FROM THE
U.S. NAVY RESEARCH LABORATORY IN MONTEREY.  THE SYSTEMS FORWARD
SPEED HAS DIMINISHED OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS AND THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS NOW 360/5 KNOTS.

A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD
FROM THE SOUTHWEST U.S. INTO THE EASTERN PACIFIC IS FORECAST TO 
KEEP ISIS ON A GENERAL NORTHERLY COURSE THROUGH 24 HOURS WITH
A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST THEREAFTER.  MOST OF THE 
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK. THE NHC TRACK IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH LBAR 
AND THE UKMET...ALBEIT SLIGHTLY FASTER. 

THE 12-FOOT SEA RADII IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT HAS BEEN EXPANDED 
TO 275 NMI BASED ON 06Z SHIP DATA.

THE TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE UNCHANGED FOR THIS ADVISORY.

THIS SYSTEM WILL POSE A SIGNIFICANT HEAVY RAINFALL THREAT FOR
INLAND AREAS WITH POSSIBLE FLASH FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES IN HIGH
TERRAIN REGIONS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT WED SEP 02 1998
 
IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER OF ISIS ON IR IMAGES.
SHIP REPORTS HAVE HELPED...AND IMPLY A NORTHWARD MOTION OF ABOUT 7
KT.  CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS NEAR THE
CENTER...PERHAPS DUE TO INTERACTION BETWEEN THE INNER CIRCULATION
AND THE NARROW MOUNTAIN RANGE THAT RUNS DOWN THE SPINE OF BAJA
CALIFORNIA.
 
THE 06Z AVN INITIALIZATION SHOWS A LARGE-SCALE ANTICYCLONE IN THE
SHAPE OF AN INVERTED V DRAPED OVER ISIS.  HENCE...THE FUTURE COURSE
OF ISIS WILL BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE HIGH.  AT
PRESENT...THE MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE PART OF THE RIDGE TO THE EAST
AND NE WILL DOMINATE AND STEER ISIS TO THE NW TO N.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT EVOLUTION...WITH MOST MODELS
SHOWING TRACKS UP THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA.

THE OFFICIAL TRACK FOLLOWS THE GUIDANCE.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS
BASED ON THAT TRACK.  A SMALL DEVIATION TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT WOULD
PUT THE CENTER OVER LAND AND LEAD TO WINDS LESS THAN WHAT WE SHOW IN
THE FORECAST.  IT IS RARE...BUT NOT UNPRECEDENTED...FOR A TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO MOVE UP THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA.  KATRINA IN 1967 IS AN
EXAMPLE OF A HURRICANE THAT CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.
 
REGARDLESS...HEAVY RAINFALL FROM THIS SYSTEM POSES A THREAT FOR
FLASH FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES.

RADAR DATA FROM MEXICO/S WEATHER SERVICE SITE AT GUASAVE...AND MORE
RECENTLY THE APPEARANCE OF AN EYE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...HAS HELPED
LOCATE THE CENTER OF ISIS OVER THE SOUTHERN GULF OF CALIFORNIA. 
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH SURFACE OBSERVATIONS TAKEN 75-100 NM FROM
THE CENTER AT LA PAZ AND CULIACAN.  IT IMPLIES A MOTION OF ABOUT 005
DEGREES/10 KT.  ALTHOUGH WINDS AT THOSE SURFACE SITES ARE ONLY 10 KT
AND 20 KT...RESPECTIVELY...AND DEEP CONVECTION DOES NOT COMPLETELY
ENCIRCLE THE CENTER...THE SYSTEM IS UPGRADED TO A 65 KT HURRICANE
BASED ON THE SATELLITE PICTURES.
 
WHILE THE GUIDANCE AGAIN TAKES ISIS TO THE NORTHWEST TO NORTH
THROUGH 72 HOURS...MOST OF THE TRACKS THIS TIME HEAD INLAND OVER
MAINLAND MEXICO...AS WOULD BE IMPLIED WITHIN 12 HOURS BY
EXTRAPOLATION OF THE CURRENT MOTION.  IF THAT HAPPENS IT WOULD
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE DURATION OF THE STORM/S LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION AND ITS POTENTIAL TO GENERATE ORGANIZED DEEP CONVECTION.
THE NHC TRACK IS MORE CAUTIOUS...SHOWING SOME BENDING BACK TO A
NORTHWEST MOTION...WITH ISIS MOVING UP THE EAST SIDE OF THE GULF OF
CALIFORNIA.  IT ALSO SHOWS A FASTER MOVEMENT THAN IN THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST...AS DOES THE GUIDANCE.
 
REGARDLESS OF THE ABOVE IMPORTANT DETAILS ABOUT TRACK...ISIS WILL
CONTINUE TO BE A FLOOD THREAT TO MEXICO FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  FOR
THE U.S. SOUTHWEST...THE 12Z 200-300 MB FORECASTS BY THE NOGAPS...
AVN...GFDL...AND ETA...SHOW AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW DEVELOPING OFFSHORE
FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE FORECAST CONFIGURATION AT THIS TIME
KEEPS RATHER STRONG WESTERLIES OR SOUTHWESTERLIES OVER NORTHWEST
MEXICO TO THE SOUTH OF THE LOW.  THIS WOULD CREATE A SHEARING
ENVIRONMENT IF ISIS MOVES INTO THAT REGION...AND ONE WHICH WOULD
LIKELY ADVECT MUCH OF ISIS/S MOISTURE TO THE EAST AND NORTHEAST...
MOSTLY TOWARD EASTERN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO.  IF THE TROUGH DROPS
FARTHER SOUTHWEST OR BECOMES MORE NEGATIVELY-TILTED...THEN ISIS
COULD BE DRAWN MORE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...AT A FASTER SPEED...AND
WOULD THEN BRING MOISTURE FARTHER TO THE WEST.

SATELLITE IMAGERY ALONG WITH RADAR DATA FROM MEXICO/S WEATHER
SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR AT GUASAVE SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER OF
ISIS IS MAKING LANDFALL AT THIS TIME...JUST SOUTH OF LOS MOCHIS. 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS FROM LOS MOCHIS SINCE 02/2245Z.  THE
SYSTEM HAS A NICE RADAR PRESENTATION AND SHOWS THAT THE HEAVIEST
RAINS ARE OCCURRING OVER INLAND SECTIONS JUST NORTH AND EAST OF 
LOS MOCHIS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS ISIS AS A HURRICANE
AT ADVISORY TIME FOLLOWED BY WEAKENING AS THE SYSTEM INTERACTS 
WITH LAND. 

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 005/10 KNOTS.  MOST OF THE 00Z
TRACK GUIDANCE CONTINUE TO MOVE ISIS TO THE NORTHWEST THROUGH 72
HOURS.  THE SYNOPTIC REASONING REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM THE LAST
PACKAGE AS MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW
DEVELOPING OFFSHORE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  THIS WOULD RESULT
IN THE ADVECTION OF MUCH OF ISIS/S ASSOCIATED MOISTURE EAST AND
NORTHEAST TOWARD EASTERN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO.  IF THE TROUGH
DROPS FARTHER SOUTHWEST OR BECOMES MORE NEGATIVELY-TILTED...THEN
ISIS COULD BE DRAWN MORE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...AT A FASTER SPEED
...AND WOULD THEN BRING MOISTURE FARTHER TO THE WEST.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS ISIS MOVING NORTHWARD THROUGH 
12 HOURS WITH A NORTH-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION BEYOND.  
THIS REPRESENTS A SLIGHT RIGHT ADJUSTMENT...THEREFORE A MORE 
INLAND TRAJECTORY...THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED PRIMARILY 
ON THE INITIAL MOTION.  

AS MENTIONED IN EARLIER ADVISORIES THE PRIMARY THREAT FROM ISIS 
WILL BE HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS RESULTING IN
POSSIBLE FLASH FLOODS...AND MUDSLIDES IN HIGH TERRAIN.  A STORM 
SURGE OF 3-5 FEET ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS IS POSSIBLE IN THE
WARNED AREA.  ALL INTERESTS IN THE WARNING AREA SHOULD RUSH ALL

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT MON SEP 07 1998

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE TO THE SOUTH OF CABO SAN LUCAS HAS
GRADUALLY BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE LAST DAY OR SO AND IS
NOW ESTIMATED TO HAVE BECOME A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  THE SYSTEM HAS
BEEN IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF EASTERLY SHEAR AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE CONVECTIVE CLOUD
MASS.  HOWEVER...NEW CONVECTIVE CELLS ARE BEING GENERATED NEAR THE
ESTIMATED CENTER AND THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW...WHICH HAD BEEN RATHER
PALTRY...IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT BETTER ESTABLISHED.  THEREFORE THE
SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE APPEARS TO BE LESSENING AND SOME
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR.  THIS IS SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...WITH COOLING OCEAN TEMPERATURES BRAKING THE
INTENSIFICATION PROCESS LATER IN THE PERIOD.

INITIAL MOTION...QUITE UNCERTAIN FOR A NEWLY-DEVELOPED TROPICAL
CYCLONE...IS ESTIMATED TO BE 300/09.  A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW SEEN
IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS WEAKENED THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ELEVEN-E.  MOREOVER THE NCEP
GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A SIZEABLE 500 MB TROUGH DROPPING INTO CALIFORNIA
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  THESE FLOW FEATURES COULD CAUSE THE TRACK TO
TURN MORE TO THE RIGHT...POSSIBLY EVEN RECURVE THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
TOWARD BAJA.  NOTWITHSTANDING...THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS FAVOR A
MORE SOUTHERN ROUTE...ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM LOOK A BIT BIZARRE.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES MORE WITH THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN AND TRENDS
MORE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  SUBSEQUENT FORECASTS MAY HAVE TO BE
ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT DEPENDING ON OBSERVED AND MODEL TRENDS.

THIS AFTERNOON WITH A CONVECTIVE BAND ATTEMPTING TO FORM ON THE
EAST SIDE OF THE CENTER.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL EXPERIENCING UPPER-
LEVEL EAST-NORTHEASTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR...APPROXIMATELY 100 MB...
RESULTING IN RESTRICTED OUTFLOW OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE. 
HOWEVER...ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL
SATELLITE STUDIES SUGGESTS THAT THE SHEAR WILL RELAX AS THE SYSTEM
MOVES NORTHWESTWARD.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB
ARE 2.0 AND 2.5...RESPECTIVELY.  THE INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS
MAINTAINED AT 30 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING 
IS FORECAST WITH THE SYSTEM ATTAINING TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY
WITHIN 12 HOURS.  AFTER 48 HOURS A WEAKENING TREND IS INITIATED
AS THE SYSTEM APPROACHES 24 DEG C SST/S.  
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/09 KNOTS.  AS WAS THE CASE AT 12Z
THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS CONSIDERABLE SCATTER.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK CALLS FOR A GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72
HOURS WITH A GRADUAL DECELERATION.  THE SYNOPTIC REASONING BEHIND
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE
AS MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS MOVE A RATHER EXPANSIVE MID-LEVEL
TROUGH...CURRENTLY POSITIONED NORTH OF 35N ALONG 140W...TO THE U.S.
WEST COAST DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS.  THIS COULD RESULT IN A
MORE NORTHERLY COURSE...POSSIBLY EVEN RECURVING THE SYSTEM TOWARD
THE BAJA PENINSULA.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST HAS BEEN ADJUSTED
SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY PRIMARILY DUE TO THE
INITIAL POSITION ESTIMATE.

BASED ON THE CURRENT FORECAST...NO WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE REQUIRED
FOR BAJA CALIFORNIA AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...ALL INTERESTS ALONG 
THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

SPECIAL GOES IR CHANNEL REVEALS A SHEARED CIRCULATION EXPOSED OVER
MOST OF THE NORTHEASTERN SEMICIRCLE.  CENTER POSITION ESTIMATES FROM
THIS IMAGERY IMPLY A SLOWER INITIAL MOTION THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED
...NEAR 290/4 KT.  INTENSITY ESTIMATES BASED ON A DVORAK SHEAR
PATTERN GIVE MAXIMUM WINDS AROUND 40 KT.
 
WITH THE SLOWER MOTION USED TO INITIALIZE THE TRACK MODELS...MOST
GUIDANCE SHOWS LITTLE NET MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  EARLY ON...THERE
IS AN INDICATION OF A CONTINUED SLOW WNW OR NW HEADING.  THEN...
THERE IS THE SUGGESTION OF A NORTHWARD TO EASTWARD DRIFT...PERHAPS
AS THE FORECAST TROUGH ALOFT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A SIMILAR HEADING TO 6 HOURS AGO...BUT PULLS
BACK THE FORECAST POINTS ALONG THAT TRACK.

INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST AND THIS ASSUMES THAT THE SHEAR WILL
DECREASE AND UPWELLING WILL NOT INHIBIT STRENGTHENING.
 
ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SHOULD
CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

CORRECTION TO ADVISORY NUMBER...6 INSTEAD OF 7
 
VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES DURING THE DAY INDICATE THAT THE
CENTER OF JAVIER IS EXPOSED EAST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.
 
SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER OF JAVIER IS NOW UNDER
THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 45
KNOTS.  THE UPPER-LEVEL SHEAR HAS DIMINISHED AND THE OUTFLOW HAS
IMPROVED SOMEWHAT.  THE MODEST STRENGTHENING TREND FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY IS MAINTAINED.
 
THE LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES IMPLY THAT JAVIER/S FORWARD
SPEED HAS SLOWED SLIGHTLY FROM THE LAST ADVISORY.  THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 285/03 KNOTS.  THE DRIVING FACTOR BEHIND
THE TRACK FORECAST CONTINUES TO BE THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH APPROACHING THE U.S. WEST COAST.  THE TROUGH
IS FORECAST TO EXTEND FAR ENOUGH SOUTH...NEAR 20N...BY 48 HOURS
TO PULL JAVIER NORTHWARD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A SLOW
WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A NORTHWEST
..THEN NORTH-NORTHWEST HEADING BEYOND 48 HOURS WITH A SLIGHT
ACCELERATION.  THIS FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.
 
THERE IS ONE CAVEAT TO THIS TRACK FORECAST...IF JAVIER STRENGTHENS
MORE THAN FORECAST IT COULD RECURVE SOONER.  ALL INTERESTS ALONG
THE WEST COAST OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

THE MOTION HAS BEEN STATIONARY FOR THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE
TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS DIVERGENT AS FAR AS DIRECTION OF MOTION IS
CONCERNED...BUT MOST OF THE MODELS SHOW VERY SLOW MOTION THROUGH 72
HOURS.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL WHICH SHOWS
THE STORM CUT OFF AND NEARLY STATIONARY.  THE AVIATION MODEL ALSO
SHOWS A TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES DIGGING SOUTHWARD JUST WEST OF THE
STORM AND THIS COULD GET THE STORM MOVING DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A LITTLE SLOWER AND A LITTLE
TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

THE LAST VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWED MOST OF THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION
EXPOSED AND THE DEEP CONVECTION WAS WELL WEST OF THE CENTER.  THIS
IS THE BASIS FOR DECREASING THE WIND SPEED TO 35 KNOTS.  THERE DOES
NOT APPEAR TO BE MUCH VERTICAL SHEAR NEARBY...EVEN THOUGH THE
EXPOSED CENTER SUGGESTS THE PRESENCE OF SHEAR.  THE FORECAST IS FOR
SOME STRENGTHENING AFTER 12 HOURS.

THE STORM IS RATHER CLOSE TO SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA...BUT THE
CURRENT WEAKENING TREND AND LOCATION OF THE DEEP CONVECTION
INDICATES THAT WARNINGS ARE NOT NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.

THE ONLY PERCEIVED MOVEMENT HAS BEEN A SLIGHT DRIFT TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...CLOSEST TO THE LIMITED
AREA BAROTROPIC MODEL LBAR...BUT NORTHEAST OF MOST OF THE
GUIDANCE...SHOWS A VERY MODEST INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED AND A
GRADUAL CURVE TO THE NORTHWEST.  ON THIS TRACK THE CENTER WILL PASS

CURRENTS HAVE COLLAPSED AND LITTLE OVERALL MOTION IS LIKELY DURING
THIS FORECAST PERIOD.  THE GFDL SHOWS ESSENTIALLY NO MOTION WHILE
MOST OTHER GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE MOTION TOWARD THE NORTHWEST OR

2 PM PDT THU OCT 01 1998
 
THE AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER LOCATED A FEW HUNDRED MILES SOUTH-
SOUTHEAST OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA HAS CONTINUED TO
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY.  VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS
THAT THE CENTER IS INVOLVED WITH A CLUSTER OF DEEP CONVECTION WHICH
HAS PERSISTED MOST OF THE DAY.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
BOTH TAFB AND SAB ARE NOW 2.0...30 KNOTS. THUS...ADVISORIES ARE
BEING INITIATED AND THE SYSTEM IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION
TWELVE-E.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 30 KNOTS.  SOME GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST ALONG THE LINES OF THE STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...BRINGING THE 
SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS BY 12 HOURS.
 
THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/5 KNOTS.  THE
DEPRESSION IS IN A WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT AND A SLOW WEST-
NORTHWEST MOTION IS EXPECTED WITH A MORE WESTERLY TRACK BY 72 
HOURS.  A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
WILL LIKELY BYPASS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.

THE DEPRESSION IS POORLY ORGANIZED AND DEEP CONVECTION IS DECREASING
AT THIS TIME.  BECAUSE T-NUMBERS REMAIN 2.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS KEPT AT 30 KNOTS.  SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST
MODEL DOES NOT INTENSIFY THE DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE GFDL
DISSIPATES IT BY 48 HOURS.  HOWEVER...THE OUTFLOW IS FAIR AND THE
OCEAN IS WARM...SO A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED AS SUGGESTED
IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 
 
THE DEPRESSION HAS BEEN MOVING LITTLE DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.
STEERING CURRENTS ARE WEAK AND ARE NOT FORECAST TO CHANGE.  MODELS
INDICATE TRACKS IN ALL DIRECTIONS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR
A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

ANALYSIS OF SATELLITE PICTURES PUTS THE CENTER CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY LOCATION...NEAR 21N109W.  SHIP REPORTS 50-75 NMI TO THE N

THIS IMPLIES THAT EITHER THE SURFACE CIRCULATION IS EXCEEDINGLY
SMALL...THERE IS NO SURFACE CIRCULATION CENTER...OR THE CENTER IS
LOCATED FARTHER TO THE NORTH THAN PREVIOUSLY ANALYZED AND WELL TO
THE NORTH OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY.  FOR THIS FORECAST
CYCLE...ADVISORIES WILL BE CONTINUED FOR A CENTER THAT IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE SHIP DATA.
 
WITH THE POOR ORGANIZATION CURRENTLY OBSERVED...NO INTENSIFICATION
WILL BE SHOWN FOR THE SHORT TERM.  THE GFDL AND UKMET DISSIPATE THE
TD NEARLY IN PLACE DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THE SHIPS SCHEME
SHOWS SLOW WEAKENING BY THREE DAYS.  THE OTHER TRACK GUIDANCE HAS

THE FIRST VISIBLE IMAGERY SUGGESTS A WEAK LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION NEAR
20.0 109.5.  THIS IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND
VIOLATES THE 06Z C6LF9 SHIP REPORT AT 21.4N 109.6W WITH A WIND OF
230/27.  IF THAT SHIP IS CORRECT...THEN THERE IS NO WELL DEFINED LOW
LEVEL CIRCULATION.  REALIZING THE LARGE UNCERTAINTY IN LOCATING THE
CENTER OF A WEAK SYSTEM...THE INITIAL POSITION IS PUT AT 20.O 109.5
AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AS STATIONARY.
 
THE GUIDANCE DIVERGES QUITE A BIT WITH THE NOGAPS SHOWING A SLOW
NORTHWEST TO NORTHWARD MOTION......THE LBAR SHOING A NORTHEASTWARD
MOTION...THE AVIATION MODEL SHOWING A MOSTLY SOUTHWARD MOTION...AND
THE GFDL AND UKMET SHOWING VERY LITTLE MOTION.  THE FORECAST
RESOLVES THIS DIVERGENCE BY HOLDING THE DEPRESSION STATIONARY.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE IS LITTLE
ORGANIZED DEEP CONVECTION AND HOLDS THE WIND SPEED AT 30 KNOTS UNTIL
36 HOURS WHEN THE WIND IS INCREASED TO 35 KNOTS FOLLOWING THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT MON OCT 12 1998
 
WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING A TROPICAL DISTURBANCE LOCATED SEVERAL HUNDRED
MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA FOR SEVERAL
DAYS. THIS DISTURBANCE WAS INITIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ITCZ AND
BEGAN LIFTING NORTHWARD ON THE 10TH BECOMING DETACHED FROM THE ITCZ
ON THE 11TH. WHILE THE SYSTEM HAS HAD A SMALL WELL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION CENTER FOR THE LAST 18-24 HOURS THE COVERAGE OF DEEP
CONVECTION HAS BEEN MEAGER.  HOWEVER...THE AREAL EXTENT OF DEEP
CONVECTION HAS EXPANDED SUFFICIENTLY DURING THE LAST 6-9 HOURS TO
WARRANT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION STATUS. 
FURTHERMORE...DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM BOTH KGWC AND SAB ARE 
NOW 2.0.  THUS...ADVISORIES ARE BEING INITIATED ON TD THIRTEEN-E
AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 30 KNOTS.
 
SATELLITE ANIMATION SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BECOME MORE SYMMETRIC
AND ANALYSES FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL
SATELLITE STUDIES...CIMSS...AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN INDICATES
LITTLE VERTICAL WIND SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM.  GRADUAL STRENGTHENING
IS FORECAST..IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE PREDICTION
SCHEME..SHIPS..WITH THE SYSTEM ATTAINING TROPICAL STORM STATUS BY 
12 HOURS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 320/05 KNOTS.  THE DEPRESSION IS ON
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL RIDGE WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE
TO STEER THE SYSTEM ON A SLOW NORTHWESTERLY COURSE.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO AND IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT
WITH LBAR AND BAMD.  THE GFDL IS THE RIGHT-MOST OF THE GUIDANCE
TAKING THE SYSTEM ON A SLOW EAST-NORTHEAST HEADING THROUGH 72 HOURS.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON IR IMAGES BUT INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 310/04 BASED ON PAST 24 HOURS OF MOTION.  THE AVIATION
MODEL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DEPRESSION WILL MOVE NORTHWESTWARD
FOLLOWING THE LARGE SCALE STEERING CURRENTS FROM A RIDGE TO THE
NORTHEAST AND THIS IS SUPPORTED BY LBAR AND THE BAM MODELS.  HOWEVER
THE GFDL MODEL DRIFTS THE SYSTEM SOUTHEASTWARD FOR 30 HOURS AND THEN
DISSIPATES IT.  THE UKMET DRIFTS THE SYSTEM SOUTHWESTWARD FOR 3 DAYS
AND THE AVATION MODEL SHOWS LITTLE MOTION FOR 3 DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND A LITTLE
SLOWER...OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE DIVERGENCE OF THE GUIDANCE.

SOME CONVECTION CONTINUES TO PERSIST.  THE SHIPS MODEL CALLS FOR
SLIGHT STRENGTHENING AND THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME
AS THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

MAINTAINS KAY AS A HURRICANE THROUGH 48 HOURS...CONSISTENT WITH THE

DEEP CONVECTION HAS ESSENTIALLY VANISHED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS AND
KAY COULD BE WEAKENING AS FAST AS IT STRENGTHENED YESTERDAY.  DVORAK
TECHNIQUE RULES CONSTRAIN SATELLITE ANALYSTS FROM LOWERING THEIR
INTENSITY ESTIMATES TO BELOW A CI OF 3.5...55 KT...AT 1200 UTC. 
THERE COULD STILL BE A CIRCULATION ALOFT OF THAT STRENGTH.  IT IS
UNLIKELY...HOWEVER...LACKING A MECHANISM TO GENERATE/SUSTAIN SUCH A
STRONG WIND AT THE SURFACE OR TO TRANSPORT IT THERE FROM ALOFT...
THAT SURFACE WINDS ARE AS HIGH AS 55 KT.  ERS-2 DATA IMPLY WINDS NO
HIGHER THAN 40 KT...AND THIS IS THE OFFICIAL ESTIMATE FOR 1500 UTC.
 
THE BEND IN TRACK TOWARD THE LEFT CONTINUES WITH INITIAL MOTION NOW
SW...230/7 KT.  A SLOW WEST TO SW MOTION IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE AND

KAY IS NOW MOVING TOWARD THE SSW...WITH THE 12Z AVN SHOWING WEAK
STEERING CURRENTS TO PERSIST.  WHILE TROPICAL CYCLONES ARE NOT KNOWN
FOR STRENGTHENING WHEN MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION...WARMER WATERS ARE
AHEAD IN THIS CASE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SOME REDEVELOPMENT COULD
EVENTUALLY OCCUR.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS AND THE NHC FORECAST
SHOW A TURN BACK TOWARD THE WEST.  THE UKMET...WHICH SEEMS TO BE
DOING QUITE WELL ON THIS SYSTEM...CONTINUES THE CYCLONIC LOOP.

KAY HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN THIS EVENING WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION
HAVING ALL BUT DISAPPEARED.  ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A FLARE-UP IN
A NARROW BAND OF SOUTH AND WEST OF THE CENTER IT IS INSUFFICIENT 
FOR DVORAK CLASSIFICATION PURPOSES.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
REDUCED TO 30 KNOTS AND KAY IS DOWNGRADED TO DEPRESSION STATUS.
THE FORECAST HAS THE SYSTEM DISSIPATING BY 36 HOURS.   

THE DEPRESSION HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE IN A SOUTH-SOUTHWEST DIRECTION

GUIDANCE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A GRADUAL TURN BACK TOWARD THE WEST
...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS THIS SCENARIO.  THE AVN AND

A LIMITED AMOUNT OF DEEP CONVECTION HAS BEEN RECURRING NEAR THE
CENTER OF THE CYCLONE...SO THE SYSTEM IS BEING MAINTAINED AS A 30-
KNOT DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME.  THE FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR
DISSIPATION IN THE 36 HOUR TIME FRAME.

MOTION CONTINUES TOWARD THE SOUTH-SOUTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AND STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL
GUIDANCE.  THE NOGAPS MODEL ALSO SHOWS A FAIRLY SIMILAR TRACK.  AS
NOTED EARLIER...OTHER MODELS SUCH AS THE UKMET AND GFDL SHOW THE
SYSTEM LOOPING TOWARD THE EAST AND EAST-NORTHEAST IN A DAY OR TWO. 
THIS IS APPARENTLY IN RESPONSE TO A MID-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFYING NEAR
THE U.S. WEST COAST.  HOWEVER IT IS PRESUMED THAT KAY WILL BE SO
WEAK THAT IT WILL BE STEERED PRIMARILY BY THE NEAR-SURFACE NORTHEAST

AN INCREASING THREAT TO THE COAST OF SOUTHERN MEXICO AND POSSIBLY

...CORRECTION FOR INITIAL WIND SPEED...
 
TD 14-E HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW SIGNS OF STRENGTHENING THIS EVENING
WITH PROMINENT BANDING FEATURES AND A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION
ONGOING OVER/NEAR THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  DVORAK OBJECTIVE-BASED
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE NOW 3.0 FROM TAFB AND 2.5+ FROM SAB.  ON
THIS BASIS TD 14-E IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS...LESTER.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS 45 KNOTS. THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW
OVER THE SYSTEM IS WELL-ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST WITH LESTER BECOMING A HURRICANE BY 24 HOURS.  THIS IS
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS. THE ONLY INHIBITING FACTOR WILL LIKELY
BE THE SYSTEMS/S PROXIMITY TO LAND.
 
SATELLITE FIXES OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 6 HOURS SUGGEST THAT
LESTER HAS TURNED SLIGHTLY TO THE WEST. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE
IS NOW 305/6 KNOTS.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF
OF MEXICO WILL MOVE EASTWARD DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS IN
RESPONSE TO THE APPROACHING TROUGH FROM THE U.S WEST COAST.  THIS
SHOULD RESULT IN A GENERAL NORTHWESTERLY STEERING ENVIRONMENT.  MOST
OF THE 00Z TRACK MODELS ARE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED AROUND THIS SCENARIO
WITH VARIATIONS IN SPEED.  THE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS SOLUTION
ARE THE UKMET AND NOGAPS WHICH TURN THE SYSTEM BACK TO THE SOUTH
AND SOUTHEAST AND WEAKEN IT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS A
GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72 HOURS AND IS SLIGHTLY TO THE
LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
WITH THE LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT IN THE TRACK THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO
HAS EXTENDED TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS WESTWARD TO PUNTA MALDONALDO
AND HAS ISSUED A HURRIANCE WATCH FROM PUNTA ARISTA TO PUNTA
MALDONALDO.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT LESTER CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER
ORGANIZED WITH VERY DEEP CONVECTION WRAPPING AROUND THE CENTER. THE
OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED TO THE SOUTHWEST BUT IS ENOUGH TO FAVOR
STRENGTHENING.  LESTER IS FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE BEFORE
REACHING THE COAST IN 24 HOURS OR SO. THEREFORE...A HURRICANE
WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED ACCORDINGLY.

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 315/07.  MOST OF THE
HURRICANE MODELS SUGGEST THAT THIS GENERAL TRACK SHOULD CONTINUE
THROUGH THE NEXT 3 DAYS SINCE THE RIDGE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO
SHOULD MOVE EASTWARD.  ON THIS TRACK THE CENTER OF LESTER SHOULD BE
NEAR THE COAST WITHIN THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 24 HOURS. GLOBAL
MODELS DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE STORM AND
MOVE LESTER VERY LITTLE OR ERRATICALLY.

AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHT HAS CONFIRMED THE ESTIMATES MADE
FROM SATELLITE PICTURES EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.  THE HURRICANE
HUNTERS INITIALLY FOUND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 993 MB AND THEN 992
MB.  WHILE PEAK FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 70 KT WERE FOUND ON THE ONLY

TODAY...BUT AN EYE HAS BECOME VISIBLE ON SATELLITE PICTURES AND
DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE NOW 4.0.  LESTER IS UPGRADED TO A HURRICANE
WITH 70 KT SURFACE WINDS.
 
THE NW HEADING HAS PERSISTED...ALTHOUGH THE PAST FEW HOURS SUGGEST A
MORE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD HEADING.  THE FORWARD MOTION APPEARS TO HAVE
DECREASED TO ABOUT 5 KT.  THE 12Z AVN KEEPS LESTER ON THE SW SIDE OF

LANDFALL WITHIN 24 HOURS.  IN CONTRAST...THE UKMET AND NOGAPS SHOW

NORTHWESTWARD ON THE WEST SIDE OF THESE OBSTACLES...ALONG THE COAST
IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF ACAPULCO.  A MORE DRASTIC CHANGE IN

THE U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT MADE ITS PASS
THROUGH LESTER A FEW HOURS AGO AND REPORTED 85 KNOT SURFACE WINDS
AND A 973 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE FROM A GPS DROPSONDE. ON ITS EXIT
LEG THROUGH THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT IT FOUND A FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND OF
98 KNOTS.  BASED ON THIS DATA...THE INITIAL INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS
INCREASED TO 90 KNOTS. VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES HAVE SHOWN A FAINT

THE OUTFLOW IS WELL-ESTABLISHED OVER THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN
PORTIONS OF THE HURRICANE WHILE IMPROVING OVER THE NORTHERN
QUADRANT.  SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS STILL FORECAST...
CONSISTENT WITH THE OUTPUT FROM SHIPS. 
 
THE RECON FIX ALONG WITH SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT
LESTER HAS BEEN MOVING JUST SOUTH OF WEST OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS. 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 265/07 KNOTS. THIS A GENERAL
WESTWARD HEADING IS EXPECTED TO BE MAINTAINED FOR THE NEXT 24-36
HOURS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE
HURRICANE. THEREAFTER...A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE IS FORECAST AS
THE SYSTEM NEARS THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH
THE STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE MODEL NHC P91E.  THE GFDL IS THE
RIGHT-MOST OF THE TRACK PREDICTION GUIDANCE WHICH MOVES LESTER ON
A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THEN BENDS TOWARD THE NORTHWEST BEYOND 24
HOURS APPARENTLY IN RESPONSE TO THE TROUGH APPROACHING THE LOWER
U.S. WEST COAST.  BESIDES BEING INCONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT MOTION
HISTORICALLY THE GFDL HAS NOT BEEN A VERY GOOD PERFORMER WITH EAST
PACIFIC TROPICAL CYCLONES. 
 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT FORECAST TRACK SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHES THE
THREAT TO SOUTHERN MEXICO.  THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO WILL LIKELY
DISCONTINUE THE WATCHES AND WARNINGS LATER TODAY.  HOWEVER...ALL
INTERESTS IN THE WATCH AND WARNING AREA SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF LESTER SINCE COASTAL SECTIONS COULD STILL
EXPERIENCE SOME EFFECTS OF THIS HURRICANE.

THE INTENSITY...COVERAGE...AND ORGANIZATION OF DEEP CONVECTION
ASSOCIATED WITH THE HURRICANE HAS DIMINISHED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
HOURS...AND THE INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 85 KNOTS ON THIS ADVISORY. 
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW IS BEING IMPEDED TO THE NORTHEAST AT THIS
TIME.  AS LESTER CONTINUES FARTHER TO THE WEST...THE UPPER-LEVEL
FLOW MAY AGAIN BECOME MORE FAVORABLE...BUT GIVEN THE
UNCERTAINTIES...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST.

MOTION IS SLIGHTLY FASTER TOWARD THE WEST...AROUND 8 OR 9 KNOTS. 
OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION GUIDANCE AND THE 500 FLOW FORECAST FROM
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SUPPORT A CONTINUED GENERALLY WESTWARD MOTION
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD...A MORE
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION IS LIKELY AS LESTER NEARS A WEAKNESS IN
THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO THE NOGAPS AND
BAROTROPIC MODEL GUIDANCE.

AS A PRECAUTION...A HURRICANE WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR A PORTION OF
THE SOUTHERN COAST OF MEXICO.

THE DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH LESTER HAS MADE A COMEBACK
THIS MORNING WITH -80 DEG C TOPS NEAR/OVER THE CENTER.  DVORAK
CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB IS 90 KNOTS WHILE SAB AND
AFGW ARE 77 KNOTS.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 85 KNOTS.
THE HURRICANE IS STILL EXPERIENCING EAST/NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR WHICH
IS INHIBITING THE OUTFLOW NORTH AND EAST OF THE CENTER.  AS
MENTIONED EARLIER THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW MAY BECOME MORE CONDUCIVE
FOR STRENGTHENING AS THE SYSTEM MOVES WESTWARD...BUT GIVEN THE
UNCERTAINTIES...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST...
CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
LESTER HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE ON A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING AND THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/9 KNOTS.  THE FIRST VISIBLE SATELLITE
IMAGES SUGGEST THE CENTER MAY BE SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE 12Z FIXES
HOWEVER...WE WILL WAIT FOR A FEW MORE PICTURES BEFORE MAKING ANY 
ADJUSTMENT. THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE SHOULD
KEEP IT ON A GENERAL WESTWARD COURSE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH A
MORE WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING THEREAFTER AS LESTER APPROACHES A
WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE. MOST OF THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE REFLECTS
THIS AND IS MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED THAN 6 HOURS AGO.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS IN
CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH NOGAPS.
 
A HURRICANE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR A PORTION OF THE SOUTHERN
COAST OF MEXICO.  THE WATCH WILL LIKELY BE DISCONTINUED LATER TODAY
AS THE HURRICANE SHOULD REMAIN WELL OFFSHORE.  HOWEVER...PORTIONS
OF THE SOUTHERN COAST OF MEXICO COULD EXPERIENCE SOME FRINGE EFFECTS
OF LESTER...NAMELY LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL
TIDES.

2 AM PDT TUE OCT 20 1998

THE HURRICANE HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED WITH THE CENTER APPARENTLY
EMBEDDED WELL WITHIN AN AREA OF QUITE COLD CLOUD TOPS.  DVORAK
ANALYSES FROM TAFB AND SAB GIVE A CONSENSUS T5.0 WHICH IS EQUIVALENT
TO A CURRENT INTENSITY OF 90 KNOTS.  NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN
STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

AS NOTED EARLIER...THERE ARE 2 GENERAL TRACK FORECAST SCENARIOS. 
ONE IS A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH IN 2-3 DAYS AS SHOWN BY THE DEEP-
LAYER BAM...LBAR AND THE GFDL MODEL.  THE OTHER IS A CONTINUED WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION AS SHOWN BY THE SHALLOW- TO MEDIUM-LAYER BAM
AND THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL MODEL.  THE LATTER SCENARIO ASSUMES
THAT THE HURRICANE WILL BE ESSENTIALLY UNAFFECTED BY A MID- TO
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH CURRENTLY ALONG 115W-120W NORTH OF 20N.  THE NCEP
GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS THIS TROUGH GRADUALLY LIFTING OUT IN 48 TO 72
HOURS...WHICH WOULD ARGUE AGAINST A NORTHWARD TURN.  HOWEVER THE
NOGAPS MODEL DOES NOT LIFT THE TROUGH OUT QUITE AS MUCH.
REGARDLESS...THERE WILL PROBABLY BE ENOUGH OF A WEAKNESS IN THE
RIDGE NEAR 110W-115W SO THAT LESTER SHOULD TURN AT LEAST
NORTHWESTWARD IN THAT VICINITY.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST FOR
THIS PACKAGE IS SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS
ONE...AND IS ESSENTIALLY BETWEEN THE 2 AFOREMENTIONED SCENARIOS.

AN EYE HAS BEEN SEEN INTERMITTENTLY OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS TOWARD
THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF A NEARLY CIRCULAR AREA OF STRONG CONVECTION.
DVORAK T-NUMBERS REMAIN AT 5.0 FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND THE ESTIMATE
OF WIND SPEED IS AGAIN 90 KT.
 
LESTER IS STILL MOVING TOWARD THE WNW BUT HAS ACCELERATED TO ABOUT
10 KT.  THE 00Z AVN SHOWED THE CUTOFF LOW OVER THE U.S. SOUTHWEST
DEVELOPING SOUTHWARD A LITTLE MORE BEFORE LIFTING OUT...AND SO DOES
THE 06Z RUN.  IN ITS WAKE...A LIGHT SOUTHWESTERLY CURRENT REMAINS AT
500 MB AND THIS SHOULD HELP INDUCE A GREATER NORTHWARD COMPONENT
WITH TIME.  THE TRACK FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS REASONING AND IS SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS SEVERAL PREDICTIONS.  IT REMAINS BETWEEN THE TWO
FORECAST TRACK SCENARIOS DESCRIBED 6 HOURS AGO.

QUITE CLOSE TO THOSE GIVEN BY THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY

CAUSE THE WEAKENING TO BE MORE RAPID THAN SHOWN HERE.

THE MOTION HAS SLOWED SLIGHTLY BUT IS STILL TOWARD THE WEST-

TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...IN RESPONSE TO A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE... WITH A TURN BACK TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST NEAR THE END OF THE

THIS DECELERATION COULD BE EVIDENCE OF LESTER NEARING THE WESTERN
EDGE OF THE RIDGE TO THE NE.  SOME ADDITIONAL NORTHWARD COMPONENT

THE INTENSITY AND COVERAGE OF DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH
LESTER HAS DECREASED MARKEDLY DURING THE LAST 6-12 HOURS...MOST 
LIKELY IN RESPONSE TO UPWELLING. IN FACT...BASED ON THE DVORAK
INTENSITY SCHEME THE CURRENT COVERAGE OF DEEP CONVECTION IS
INSUFFICIENT TO CLASSIFY THE SYSTEM AS A HURRICANE. HOWEVER...
THE CIRCULATION REMAINS INTACT AND TYPICALLY TROPICAL CYCLONES 
TAKE TIME TO UNWIND...A PROPERTY INCORPORATED INTO THE DVORAK
TECHNIQUE.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE REDUCED TO 65 KNOTS.
GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST WITH LESTER BECOMING A TROPICAL 
STORM BY 12 HOURS.
 
LESTER HAS BEEN STATIONARY FOR THE LAST 36 HOURS BUT SATELLITE 
FIXES OVER THE LAST 3-6 HOURS SUGGEST THAT A SOUTH TO SOUTH-
SOUTHWEST DRIFT HAS BEGUN. THIS IS CONFIRMED BY U.S. AIR FORCE 
AND U.S. NAVY DMSP FIXES/IMAGERY. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
200/02 KNOTS.  A SOUTH-SOUTHWEST TO SOUTHWEST DRIFT SHOULD CONTINUE
TODAY WITH A MORE WESTERLY MOTION THEREAFTER AS HIGH DEVELOPS
NORTHWEST OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS
THIS SCENARIO AND IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE NORTHWEST OF THE CONVECTIVE CLUSTER.  INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS
AT 40 KNOTS WHICH IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN VARIOUS DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES.  SHIPS GUIDANCE INDICATES WEAKENING DUE TO INCREASED
SHEAR WHILE THE GFDL SHOWS A LITTLE STRENGTHENING.  THEREFORE...THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/09.  HOWEVER...THE DYNAMICAL MODELS
...GFDL...NOGAPS...AND UKMET...ALL INDICATE A SLOW DOWN AS STEERING
CURRENTS WEAKEN.  OUR CURRENT TRACK IS ADJUSTED CONSIDERABLY BASED
ON THIS AND IS A BLEND BETWEEN THE DYNAMICAL MODELS AND THE
SHALLOW/MID LAYER BAMS.  IF LESTER WERE TO BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY
STRONGER THAN FORECAST...A MORE RAPID RECURVATURE TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST COULD OCCUR...SIMILAR TO THE DEEP LAYER BAM.

AN EYE HAS NOT BEEN APPARENT ALTHOUGH RECENT ENHANCED IR IMAGES SHOW
A BIT OF A WARM SPOT NEAR THE APPARENT CENTER.  THE DEEP CONVECTION
CONTINUES TO BE ASYMMETRIC WITH COLDEST TOPS PRIMARILY OVER THE
SOUTHWEST SEMICIRCLE.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS FAIRLY STRONG EXCEPT
TO THE EAST.  A LITTLE MORE STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST BEFORE
MADELINE REACHES THE COAST.

MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE NORTHWARD...010/5.  THE 06Z RUN OF THE
NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS MADELINE NEAR THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A
MID-LEVEL RIDGE WITH A TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. DURING THE
NEXT 2-3 DAYS.  TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS SOME SPREAD BUT...BASED
ON THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN...THE MOST REASONABLE SOLUTION SEEMS TO BE A
GENERALLY NORTHWARD MOTION WITH A GRADUAL NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD BEND
NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE AND THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE MODEL NHC91.

2 AM PDT MON OCT 19 1998

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE SO NO LARGE CHANGES ARE MADE TO
THE MOTION ESTIMATE...SLOWLY NORTHWARD.   THE STEERING OF MADELINE
DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE ROLES OF A MID- TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NEAR
THE BAJA PENINSULA AND THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WHICH EXTENDS WESTWARD
TO THE VICINITY OF THE HURRICANE.  IF THE FORMER FEATURE
DOMINATES...THEN MADELINE WOULD ACCELERATED NORTH TO NORTHEASTWARD. 
IF THE LATTER IS MORE INFLUENTIAL...THEN A SLOWER NORTH TO
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION COULD DEVELOP.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK
FORECAST IS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE.  THIS IS A
COMPROMISE BETWEEN A NORTH TO NORTHEASTWARD OPTION AS SHOWN BY SOME
OF THE MODELS SUCH AS THE MEDIUM BAM AND THE BAROTROPIC..AND A NORTH
TO NORTHWESTWARD TRACK AS SHOWN BY NOGAPS AND THE GFDL MODEL.  

THE SYSTEM DOES NOT LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE AT THE MOMENT WITH ONLY A
SMALL AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION AND EVIDENCE OF SOUTHERLY SHEARING. 
CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS KEPT AT 75 KNOTS. VISIBLE SATELLITE
PICTURES LATER TODAY SHOULD PROVIDE A BETTER INTENSITY ESTIMATE.  NO

LOCATING THE CIRCULATION CENTER OF MADELINE IS A DIFFICULT TASK
WITH INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED
WITH THE HURRICANE HAS DIMINISHED AND INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE
CENTER IS PARTIALLY EXPOSED AS A RESULT OF SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY
VERTICAL WIND SHEAR...PER IMAGERY AND CIMSS ANALYSES.  DVORAK
CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 4.0 FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB...
AND ARE THE BASIS FOR REDUCING THE WINDS TO 65 KNOTS.  THIS
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD UNTIL LANDFALL FOR NOW...FORECAST IN ABOUT
24 HOURS...UNTIL A DEFINITIVE TREND CAN BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH
VISIBLE IMAGERY.  

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 360/04 KNOTS. THE SATELLITE
FIXES SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER MAY BE SLIGHTLY WEST OF THE PREVIOUS
TRACK.  THUS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS BEEN ADJUSTED A BIT
TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAME
GENERAL DIRECTION AND SPEED OF MOTION.  THERE STILL IS UNCERTAINLY
SURROUNDING WHICH FEATURE WILL DOMINATE THE STEERING OF MADELINE...
I.E. THE MID- TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NEAR THE BAJA PENINSULA OR THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE EXTENDING WESTWARD TO THE VICINITY OF THE
HURRICANE.  THE WESTWARD POSITION ADJUSTMENT SEEMS TO SUPPORT THE

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/03 KNOTS.  THE FIXES FROM TAFB
...SAB AND AFGWC ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER
HAS DRIFTED NORTH-NORTHWEST OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS. THE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO SHOW CONSIDERABLE SCATTER WITH THE STATISTICAL
MODELS SHOWING A NORTHWARD MOTION WHILE MOST OF THE DYNAMIC MODELS
SHOW A NORTH-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST HEADING. THE GFDL FOLLOWS THE
LATTER SCENARIO THRU 24 HRS THEN TURNS THE CYCLONE WEST THEN
SOUTHWEST.  THE REASONING BEHIND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REMAINS
UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. THE LATEST NHC TRACK IS 
SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED ON THE INITIAL MOTION
AND STILL HOLDS TO A VERY SLOW NORTH-NORTHWEST DRIFT THRU 72 HRS.

ARLENE HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED THIS EVENING.  THE
CDO IS STILL IN PLACE AND CENTER APPEARS TO BE EMBEDDED IN IT.  THE
SYSTEM MAINTAINS GOOD UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW AND HAS NOT BEEN SHEARED
BY APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE NOW 55 KT AND 45 KT...RESPECTIVELY AND AIR
FORCE GLOBAL IS AT 35 KT.  TAFB METEOROLOGIST HAS NOTED THAT
SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT MAIN INFLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS IS FROM THE
SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST AND LITTLE OR NO INFLOW FROM STABLE AIR IN HIGH
TO THE NORTH...WHICH HAS BLOCKED THE SYSTEM.  THIS MAY BE MAIN
REASON WHY ARLENE HAS BEEN ABLE TO INTENSIFY OVER THESE COOL SSTS. 
THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE RAISED TO 45 KT. ARLENE IS
INTENSIFYING AT THE RATE OF 5 KNOTS EVERY 6-HOURS SO 12 HOUR
FORECAST IS 55 KNOTS.  INTENSITY FORECAST TO 60 KNOTS AT 24 HOURS
AND HELD STEADY AT THIS VALUE.  HOWEVER...IF TREND CONTINUES...MAY
HAVE A HURRICANE IN 24 HOURS.
 
THE LATEST SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB SHOW THAT ARLENE
HAS BEEN WOBBLING NORTHWARD AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS 360/03
KNOTS. HOWEVER...LATEST IR ANIMATION SUGGESTS A WOBBLE TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHWEST.
 
GUIDANCE MODELS ARE STARTING TO AGREE ON DIRECTION OF MOTION FOR
ARLENE.  UKMET..AVN..NOGAPS..GFDL..BAMM AND BAMS MOVE SYSTEM SLOWLY
IN A GENERAL NORTHWEST TO WEST DIRECTION OUT TO 36 HOURS.  AFTER 36
HOURS...DIFFERENT ACCELERATIONS IN SPEED CAUSE TRACKS TO DIVERGE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE WITH A

THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE OBSERVED STRUCTURE OR
ESTIMATED INTENSITY OF THE TROPICAL STORM.  THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION CENTER REMAINS NEARLY EXPOSED NEAR THE WESTERN EDGE OF
THE DENSE OVERCAST.  DEEP CONVECTION WITHIN A SMALL CDO-LIKE FEATURE
HAS BEEN PULSATING DURING THE DAY.  AGAIN...THERE IS A SLIGHT
POSSIBILITY THAT THE WEST-NORTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR OVER THE AREA
MAY RELAX.  THUS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST ALLOWS FOR A SLIGHT INCREASE
IN INTENSITY DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  THIS IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR
THE LATEST STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...
SHIPS...OUTPUT. 

ARLENE HAS MOVED SLOWLY WESTWARD DURING THE LAST SIX HOURS OR SO. 
THE STORM HAS BEEN EMBEDDED WITHIN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE AND UNABLE TO MOVE MUCH TOWARD THE NORTH.  HOWEVER...GUIDANCE
MODELS SUGGEST THAT ENOUGH OF A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE WILL DEVELOP
SO AS TO ALLOW A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
IN FACT...THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ITS
PREDECESSOR AND TURNS ARLENE NORTHWEST AND NORTH IN TWO TO THREE
DAYS.  THE U.K. MET. OFFICE MODEL TURNS THE CYCLONE NORTHWARD EVEN
SOONER.  THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST SHOWS A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST AND
IS IN BETWEEN THE LATEST MEDIUM BAM AND AVN MODEL TRACKS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/04.  THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL
CONTINUES TO SHOW THE STORM EMBEDDED IN A RIDGE.  GUIDANCE MODELS
ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT A SLOW NORTHWEST TO NORTHWARD
MOTION FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED A
SMIDGEON TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AS ARE THE NOGAPS
AND GFDL MODELS COMPARED TO THEIR PREVIOUS RUNS.  A TROUGH IN THE
WESTERLIES IS FORECAST TO MOVE NORTH OF THE STORM IN THE NEXT THREE
DAYS AND COULD CAUSE SOME NORTHWARD ACCELERATION NEAR THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD...AND THIS IS INDICATED BY THE UKMET MODEL BUT NOT
BY THE NOGAPS OR GFDL.
 
WESTERLY SHEAR CONTINUES TO IMPINGE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE STORM
AND DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE DOWN TO 3.0 CURRENT INTENSITY
NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB.  THE KGWC ESTIMATE IS 2.5.  U.S. NAVY AND
ECMWF SSM/I AND SCATTEROMETER WIND SPEEDS AROUND THE STORM SHOW WIND
SPEEDS OF LESS THAN 50 KNOTS.  SO THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS
DECREASED 5 KNOTS TO 45 KNOTS ON THIS BASIS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
WIND SPEEDS ARE ALSO DECREASED 5 KNOTS FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
IN AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS AND GFLD GUIDANCE.
 
THE CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED AT 1000
MB IS INCREASED TO 1009 MB BASED ON SHIP REPORTS WHICH SHOW
SURROUNDING PRESSURES TO BE RATHER HIGH.

ARLENE CONTINUES MOVING WEST WITH THE INITIAL MOTION OF 275/05.
LARGER SCALE GUIDANCE IS IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT...WITH BROAD
LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGING NORTHEAST OF ARLENE PRODUCING A GRADUAL TURN
TO THE NORTHWEST/NORTH DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THIS WOULD TAKE
THE CENTER OF ARLENE NEAR OR EAST OF BERMUDA. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE
IS MORE DIVERSE...WITH THE BAMS PASSING JUST NORTH OF BERMUDA...THE
GFDL AND BAMM PASSING JUST SOUTH OF BERMUDA...AND THE BAMD...A98E
AND LBAR MAINTAINING A WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OVERALL GUIDANCE AND
SHIFTED SOMEWHAT TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.

CONVECTION HAS INCREASED NEAR THE CENTER DURING THE NIGHT...
ALTHOUGH THE CENTER REMAINS PARTIALLY EXPOSED DUE TO WESTERLY SHEAR.
THE LATEST INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 45 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND 2.5
FROM AFWA. THE CURRENT INTENSITY REMAINS AT 45 KT.

THE QUESTION NOW IS HOW MUCH SHEAR WILL ARLENE ENCOUNTER? THE LATEST
WATER VAPOR WINDS SUGGEST 10-20 KT WESTERLIES WEST OF THE CENTER...
WITH THE SHIPS MODEL INDICATING LESS THAN 15 KT OF SHEAR THROUGH 48
HOURS. AVAILABLE GLOBAL MODELS ALSO SUGGEST A DECREASE IN SHEAR...
WITH A UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DIGGING WEST OF BERMUDA BUILDING A RIDGE
NEAR ARLENE. BASED ON THIS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS A LITTLE
STRONGER THAN IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. THE MODELS INDICATE STRONG
NORTHERLY SHEAR DEVELOPING NEAR ARLENE BY 72 HOURS...WHICH IN
COMBINATION WITH COOLER SSTS SHOULD WEAKEN THE SYSTEM BY THAT TIME.
 
WIND RADII AT THE 36-72 HOUR FORECAST TIMES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED
ON THE PREDICTED NORTHWARD TURN AND HIGH PRESSURE TO THE EAST.

WATCHES OR WARNINGS FOR BERMUDA WILL NEED TO BE CONSIDERED LATER
TODAY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 285/04...A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO INDICATE A GRADUAL
TURN TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH...WITH CONTINUED DISAGREEMENT AS
TO WHETHER ARLENE WILL PASS EAST OR WEST OF BERMUDA. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SHIFTED TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND TAKES
THE CENTER OVER BERMUDA. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE 00Z GFDL IS
MUCH FASTER TURNING ARLENE NORTHWARD THAN THE 18Z RUN AND THUS LOOKS
A LITTLE SUSPECT. 
 
EVEN WITH THE DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING THE CENTER...IT REMAINS EXPOSED
WEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION. THE SHEAR HAS LESSENED TO THE POINT
WHERE ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE DEEP CONVECTION. 
HOWEVER...THERE IS STILL ENOUGH SHEAR TO HAMPER INTENSIFICATION.
THE INTENSITY FORECAST CONTINUES TO CALL FOR SLIGHT STRENGTHENING
ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...THERE IS A
POSSIBILITY THAT ARLENE MAY MEET STRONG SHEAR BEYOND 48 HOURS AND
WEAKEN.
 
AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS ENROUTE AND
IS SCHEDULED TO REACH ARLENE AROUND 11Z. 

A TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR BERMUDA. THE AIRCRAFT
DATA SHOULD HELP DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS
AROUND THE CENTER...AND THUS WHEN WARNINGS MAY BE REQUIRED.

AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT AND SATELLITE FIXES THIS
MORNING INDICATE THAT ARLENE HAS MOVED LITTLE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL
HOURS...AND THE CENTER MAY BE REFORMING CLOSER TO THE DEEP
CONVECTION.  

ARLENE IS IN A VERY WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT CUTOFF FROM THE
WESTERLY FLOW TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND
THE GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE WEST OF
ARLENE WILL DIG SOUTHWARD STRONGLY OVER THE NEXT 36 HOURS.  BEYOND
THAT...A SECOND TROUGH APPROACHING THE U.S. EAST COAST AT 72 HOURS
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO RECURVE ARLENE.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS A LITTLE
SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...WITH THE MEDIUM BAM TAKING ARLENE
TO THE WEST OF BERMUDA...AND THE GFDL TO THE EAST.  OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS TRACK BUT SLOWER...AND A BLEND
OF THE GFDL AND MEDIUM BAM.  WITH THE SLOWER INITIAL MOTION...A
TROPICAL STORM WARNING FOR BERMUDA IS NOT YET NECESSARY.
 
ALTHOUGH SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 2.5 AND
3.0...RESPECTIVELY...RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT FOUND 51 KT AT A FLIGHT
LEVEL OF 1000 FT.  WITH THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER CLOSER TO THE
CONVECTION...CURRENT INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 45 KT.  SHIPS AND AVN
INDICATE THAT THE SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM IS DECREASING AND SO
INTENSITY IS FORECAST TO INCREASE TO 55 KT IN 24 HOURS.  LONGER
TERM...COOLER SSTS AND INCREASING SHEAR WILL WEAKEN THE CYCLONE.

SATELLITE IMAGERY DURING THE AFTERNOON INDICATES THAT ARLENE IS ONCE
AGAIN LOSING ITS BATTLE WITH SHEAR...WITH A LOW-LEVEL CENTER EXPOSED
TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB
AND SAB ARE 3.0...AND THE INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 45 KT.  AN
AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN THE CYCLONE
AGAIN EARLY THIS EVENING TO SEE WHETHER THE WINDS HAVE DECREASED. 
THE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO CHANGE FROM SOUTHWESTERLY TO NORTHEASTERLY
OVER THE NEXT 36 H...IMPLYING A BRIEF INTERVAL OF FAVORABLE
CONDITIONS...BUT THIS WILL PROBABLY BE TOO BRIEF TO ALLOW
SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.  LONGER TERM...THE INCREASING SHEAR AND
COOLER SSTS SHOULD PROVE FATAL.

AFTER REMAINING ALMOST STATIONARY THIS MORNING...ARLENE HAS RESUMED
A SLOW MOTION TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE CENTER IS VERY BROAD AND POORLY
DEFINED...BUT OUR BEST INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 325/3.  THERE WAS
NO 12Z GFDL TODAY...BUT REMAINING GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT ARLENE WILL
REMAIN EAST OF BERMUDA.  OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT
OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE TOWARD THE SHALLOW BAM...IN ANTICIPATION OF
A MOSTLY SHEARED SYSTEM.

A USAF RESERVE AIRCRAFT FIXED THE STORM RECENTLY.  BASED ON THIS FIX
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/03 ALTHOUGH THE LOW LEVEL CENTER
IS NOT THAT WELL DEFINED.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES
ACCELERATION TOWARD THE NORTH AFTER 48 HOURS AS A MAJOR TROUGH
APPROACHES.  ONLY THE NOGAPS REMAINS SLOW WESTNORTHWESTWARD THROUGH
72 HOURS AND THIS WAS FROM THE 12Z RUN.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SHIFTED A SMIDGEON TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND
ACELLERATES THE STORM TO 12 KNOTS AFTER 48 HOURS.

THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED 55 KNOTS AT 1500 FEET ALTITUDE IN THE
NORTHEAST QUADRANT AND DVORAK T NUMBERS ARE 3.0 FROM TAFB AND SAB. 
SO THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 50 KNOTS ON THIS BASIS.  OTHERWISE
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY EXCEPT
FOR ADDING 5 KNOTS AT ALL FORECAST PERIODS AND CALLS FOR GRADUAL
WEAKENING IN 36 HOURS AS COLDER SSTS ARE ENCOUNTERED.

THE 34 KNOTS RADIUS IS INCREASED TO 125 NMI IN THE NORTHEAST
QUADRANT BASED ON AIRCRAFT DATA.  THIS IS EXTENDED TO THE NORTHWEST
QUADRANT IN 24 HOURS AS SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THE DEEP CONVECTION
ROTATING CYCLONICALLY AROUND THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE STORM.

BERMUDA IS RETAINING THE TROPICAL STORM WATCH FOR THIS ADVISORY.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT WED JUN 16 1999

DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH ARLENE HAS DECREASED DURING THE
NIGHT...AND IS ALSO LESS WIDESPREAD AND VIGOROUS THAN 24 HOURS AGO.
THIS COULD MEAN THE START OF A WEAKENING TREND. SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA REMAIN AT 45 KT. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 50 KT...ALTHOUGH THE NEW HURRICANE HUNTER
PLANE DUE INTO THE STORM AROUND 12Z MAY VERY WELL FIND A WEAKER
SYSTEM.

ALTHOUGH CIRRUS IS OBSCURING THE LOW LEVEL CENTER...ARLENE APPEARS
TO BE MOVING 300/4 KT. THE STORM IS SLOWLY CURVING AROUND THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC. ALL GUIDANCE
MODELS AGREE ON A GRADUAL ACCELERATION OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS IN
RESPONSE TO A WESTERLY TROUGH MOVING OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS THIS...ALTHOUGH IT IS A LITTLE SLOWER
THAN THE GUIDANCE DUE TO THE MODELS MOVING ARLENE TOO QUICKLY
NORTHWARD FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS PROBLEMATICAL. CONVECTION HAS DECREASED
EVEN THOUGH THE ENVIRONMENT APPEARS RELATIVELY FAVORABLE. NORTHERLY
SHEAR SHOULD DEVELOP OVER ARLENE IN THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS WHICH
SHOULD CAUSE WEAKENING. HOWEVER...MODEL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THE SHEAR
MAY NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO CAUSE RAPID WEAKENING. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR THE SAME WEAKENING AS THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...
EXCEPT TO MAKE ARLENE EXTRATROPICAL BY 72 HOURS.

FORECAST WIND RADII HAVE BEEN CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE ON
THE BASIS OF THE FORECAST MOTION...AND THE EXPECTATION THAT THE
NORTHERLY SHEAR WILL SUPPRESS CONVECTION IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT.

NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR IS BEGINNING TO IMPINGE ON THE SYSTEM AND A
GRADUAL SPIN-DOWN OF ARLENE IS EXPECTED.
 
THE CENTER IS EASILY LOCATED THIS MORNING BY BOTH RECON AND
SATELLITE...AND IS SOMEWHAT NORTH OF THE OVERNIGHT IR POSITIONS. 
RECONNAISSANCE FIXES SUGGEST THAT ARLENE IS NOW MOVING AT 340/6.
THE STORM IS SLOWLY CURVING AROUND THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE CENTERED

CENTRAL PRESSURE IS NOW UP TO 1015 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS VERY

ARLENE IS BARELY OF TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  THE SYSTEM IS IN AN
AREA OF CONFLUENT UPPER-LEVEL FLOW TO THE NORTH OF A LARGE UPPER-

INHIBITING THE REDEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION.  VERTICAL SHEAR APPEARS
TO BE INCREASING OVER THE AREA AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE
MARGINAL.  THEREFORE... FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY.  THE OFFICIAL

FORWARD MOTION HAS SLOWED TO A DRIFT BUT TRACK GUIDANCE INDICATES A
MOSTLY NORTHWARD MOTION DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS WITH A
GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHEAST THEREAFTER.  THIS IS

SATELLITE IMAGES AND SURFACE REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE CENTER OF
SHORT-LIVED TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWO IS ALREADY OVER LAND AND
WEAKENING.  IT IS FORECAST TO DISSIPATE AS IT MOVES WESTWARD.  HEAVY
RAINS ARE EXPECTED TO SPREAD OVER PORTIONS OF CENTRAL MEXICO DURING
THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. 

THIS WILL BE THE LAST ADVISORY ISSUED ON THIS SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN

TROPICAL DEPRESSION THREE DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT WED AUG 18 1999

RECONNAISSANCE AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT A CLOSED
CIRCULATION HAS FORMED OVER THE BAY OF CAMPECHE.  THEREFORE
ADVISORIES ARE BEING INITIATED.

INITIAL MOTION IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS STILL IN
THE DEVELOPING STAGE AND PREVIOUS CENTER FIXES SHOW A LOT OF
SCATTER.  MY BEST ESTIMATE IS WEST-NORTHWEST NEAR 7 KNOTS AT THIS
TIME.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A RETROGRESSION OF THE MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE SOUTH-CENTRAL UNITED STATES...WITH A
WEAKNESS EXTENDING NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE SOUTHWEST GULF TO A
DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.  THIS COMPLICATES
THE TRACK FORECAST AND LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE COULD REMAIN OVER THE SOUTHWEST GULF FOR THE NEXT FEW
DAYS...DUE TO WEAK STEERING CURRENTS.  THIS IS SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST AS WELL.

THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE SOME WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY
SHEARING DUE TO AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN GULF. 
THERE IS ALSO AN UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER THE
NORTH-CENTRAL GULF WHICH COULD BE IMPARTING SOME SHEAR.  EVEN THOUGH
THE SHEAR IS A NEGATIVE FACTOR FOR STRENGTHENING... THE ULTIMATE
EFFECT OF THE WEAK UPPER TROUGH ADJACENT TO THE DEPRESSION MAY BE TO
SPIN UP THE TROPICAL CYCLONE...AS SUGGESTED BY SOME RECENT RESEARCH. 
THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECAST SHOWS THESE UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC FEATURES
BECOMING MOSTLY INDISTINCT...WITH ANTICYCLONIC FLOW DEVELOPING OVER
THE AREA IN 2-3 DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS LITTLE
CHANGE IN STRENGTH EARLY IN THE PERIOD FOLLOWED BY SOME MODEST
INTENSIFICATION.  THIS ASSUMES THAT THE SYSTEM WILL REMAIN OVER
WATER THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.

AIRCRAFT RECONNAISSANCE AND SATELLITE DATA THIS EVENING INDICATE
THAT THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION REMAINS VERY POORLY ORGANIZED...WITHOUT
A WELL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  THERE IS LITTLE CONVECTION NEAR
THE LOCATION WHERE THE AIR FORCE RESERVE AIRCRAFT REPORTED A

BE REDEVELOPING TO THE NORTHEAST.  

INITIAL MOTION IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN...BUT IS ESTIMATED TO BE 280/2. 
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A RETROGRESSION OF THE MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE SOUTH-CENTRAL UNITED STATES...WITH A
WEAKNESS EXTENDING NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE SOUTHWEST GULF TO A

SUGGEST THAT THE CYCLONE MAY REMAIN OVER THE SOUTHWEST GULF FOR THE
NEXT FEW DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK CALLS FOR A SLOW WEST-
NORTWESTWARD MOTION...BUT IF THE SYSTEM REFORMS TO THE NORTHEAST A
MORE NORTHERLY TRACK IS LIKELY.
 
THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING SOME WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY
SHEAR DUE TO AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN GULF.
THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECAST SHOWS THE TROUGH MOVING OFF TO THE WEST

SATELLITE PICTURES THIS MORNING SUGGEST THAT TROPICAL DEPRESSION
THREE REMAINS ILL-DEFINED WITH A CHAOTIC CONVECTIVE PATTERN. THE
ALLEGED CENTER IDENTIFIED BY TAFB AND SAB METEOROLOGIST IS
POSITIONED SLIGHTLY NORTHEAST OF THE 03Z ADVISORY LOCATION. BASED 
ON THE TAFB AND SAB FIXES...THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/2 KT.
HOWEVER...AS MENTIONED IN THE LAST ADVISORY THE CENTER LOCATION 
REMAINS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.  A U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT IS ENROUTE TO INVESTIGATE THE SYSTEM AND WILL AID IN
DETERMINING THE LOCATION OF THE CENTER.     
 
THE OOZ AVN MODEL CONTINUES THE TREND FROM EARLIER RUNS OF 
RETROGRADING THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE SOUTH-CENTRAL
UNITED STATES...WITH A RESULTING WEAKNESS STRETCHING NORTHEASTWARD
FROM THE SOUTHWEST GULF TO A DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN
UNITED STATES.  THE GFDI AND AVN TRACKS GO IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS...
THE AVN EAST AND THE GFDI WEST-SOUTHWEST THEN SOUTH-SOUTHEAST INTO
CENTRAL AMERICA. THE REMAINDER OF THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS MORE 
CENTERED ON A WEST-NORTHWESTERLY COURSE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS
A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72 HRS...REPRESENTING A SLIGHT
NORTHWARD ADJUSTMENT TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE DUE TO THE INITIAL
POSITION. 

THE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR DUE TO
THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN GULF. THE GLOBAL
MODEL FORECAST SHOWS THE TROUGH MOVING OFF TO THE WEST AWAY FROM
THE DEPRESSION WHICH MAY ALLOW A MORE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR
STRENGTHENING BEYOND 24 HOURS.

CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH TROPICAL DEPRESSION THREE HAS INCREASED
CONSIDERABLY OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...WITH A 180 NM WIDE CONVECTIVE
MASS COVERING THE LOW LEVEL CENTER. REPORTS FROM THE AIR FORCE
RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTERS INDICATE THE CENTRAL PRESSURE IS STILL
1007-1008 MB. THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED 35-45 KT WINDS 90 NM FROM THE
CENTER JUST OFFSHORE OF VERACRUZ...AN AREA NOTORIOUS FOR WIND
FUNNELING. BASED ON THIS...AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 30
KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...THE SYSTEM WILL REMAIN A DEPRESSION FOR THIS
PACKAGE.

THE CYCLONE CONTINUES TO BE EMBEDDED IN LIGHT TO NON-EXISTENT
STEERING FLOW...AND BASED ON THE RECON FIXES OF THIS MORNING AND
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON THE INITIAL MOTION IS STATIONARY. NHC HURRICANE
GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST DRIFT SHOULD BEGIN
IN THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS
THIS...AND IT IS LITTLE CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE SAVE FOR
THE INITIAL POSITION.

THE DEPRESSION SHOWS FAIR TO GOOD OUTFLOW OVER THE NORTHEAST
SEMICIRCLE WITH ONLY LIGHT TO MODERATE SHEAR. WITH THE INCREASE IN
CONVECTION... CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR THE SYSTEM TO REACH
TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH LATER TODAY OR TONIGHT...WITH SLOW

FIRST HURRICANE OF THE 1999 ATLANTIC SEASON.  PRESSURE FALLS IN BRET
HAVE BEEN PRECEDING WIND INCREASES...AND WE EXPECT THAT BRET WILL
CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS CLOSE TO
THE SHIPS MODEL GUIDANCE AND SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 355/8...A BIT FASTER TO THE NORTH.  MOST
GUIDANCE IS SHIFTED A LITTLE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...THE

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT FOUND 85-90 KNOT FLIGHT
LEVEL WINDS IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT ON HIS LAST PASS WITH A
PRESSURE OF 980 MB.  AT NEARLY THE SAME TIME THE MIAMI SATELLITE
ESTIMATE WAS 77 KNOTS AND A PRESSURE ESTIMATE OF 979 MB. THUS...THE
WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 80 KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS
CLOSE TO THE SHIPS MODEL GUIDANCE WHICH FORECASTS BRET TO BECOME A
MAJOR HURRICANE IN 24 HOURS.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 340/6...A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHWEST. 
MODEL GUIDANCE HAS CHANGED LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THE
AVN CONTINUES TO SUGGEST THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH
MID-LEVEL RIDGING NORTH OF BRET TO TURN THE HURRICANE TO THE
NORTHWEST THEN WEST AND THEN SOUTHWEST AS DO THE BAM MODELS.  THE
UKMET CONTINUES TO MOVE THE HURRICANE INTO LOWER CENTRAL TEXAS WHILE
THE LBAR AND GFDL ARE NEAR THE US/MEXICAN BORDER.  THE OFFICIAL
SOLUTION IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL AND SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST.
 
ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE TEXAS COAST SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF BRET DURING THE WEEKEND.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 340/07.  THE 06Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS
A SUBSTANTIAL 500 MB HIGH HOLDING STEADY IN THE VICINITY OF NEW
MEXICO FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS AND THIS SHOULD CAUSE A SLOWING OF THE
NORTHWARD MOTION AND/OR A TURN TOWARD THE WEST.  THE GFDL MODEL
SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE WEST WITH THE CENTER AT THE COAST NEAR THE
TEXAS MEXICO BORDER IN 36 HOURS.  THE UKMET HAS A SIMILAR TRACK BUT
MUCH SLOWER AND THE NOGAPS KEEPS BRET ABOUT STATIONARY FOR 72 HOURS.
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND HAS THE CENTER AT THE COAST IN 36 HOURS.  THIS MAY BE A
LITTLE FAST BUT IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL MODEL.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK BRINGS 34 KNOT WINDS TO THE COAST IN ABOUT 24
HOURS...DEPENDING ON THE GALE RADIUS IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT WHICH
IS ONLY ABOUT 60 NMI AT THIS TIME...BUT WHICH COULD EXPAND IN THE
NEXT 24 HOURS.  SO IT IS TIME TO PUT UP HURRICANE WARNINGS...FROM LA
PESCA MEXICO TO BAFFIN BAY TEXAS.

THE HIGHEST RECON WIND SPEED THIS MORNING IS 92 KNOTS JUST NORTHEAST
OF THE CENTER.  THE LATEST CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE IS 978 MB.  THE
OFFICIAL WIND SPEED AND FORECAST IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...INCREASING THE WIND SPEED TO 105 KNOTS BEFORE LANDFALL. 
THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL TAKES THE WIND TO 110 KNOTS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 345/07.  THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL RUN
SHOWS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE LARGE SCALE FEATURES INFLUENCING THE
MOTION WITH AN ANTICYCLONE ANCHORED IN THE VICINITY OF NEW MEXCIO
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THE TRACK MODELS HAVE ALSO CHANGED LITTLE.
THE GFDL MODEL IS THE FASTEST WITH THE CENTER AT THE COAST NEAR THE
US/MEXICO BORDER IN 24 HOURS.  THE UKMET AND NOGAPS MODELS ARE MUCH
SLOWER AND THE NOGAPS IS FARTHER SOUTH SHOWING A WEST THEN
SOUTHWESTWARD TURN.  THE AVIATION AND BAM MODELS ALSO SHOW THE TURN
CONTINUING AROUND TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A
LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE GFDL BUT FASTER THAN ALL THE OTHER MODELS AND
KEEPS THE LANDFALL LOCATION NEAR THE BORDER IN 24 TO 36 HOURS.
 
THE LATEST SURFACE PRESSURE FROM RECONNAISSANCE IS 976 MB AND THEY
REPORTED 101 KNOTS AT 850 MB JUST NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  ALSO A
GPS DROP SHOWED A WIND MAX OF 112 KNOTS AT 900 MB IN THE EYEWALL
DECREASING TO 75 KNOTS NEAR THE SURFACE.  THE OFFICIAL WIND SPEED AT
21Z IS INCREASED TO 90 KNOTS AND 110 KNOTS IS FORECAST IN 24
HOURS...JUST BEFORE LANDFALL.  THIS IS SIMIALR TO THE SHIPS MODEL
FORECAST AND IS BASED ON WARM SSTS...MINIMAL VERTICAL SHEAR AND THE
APPEARANCE OF A WELL DEFINED EYE ON VISIBLE IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON.

A TROPICAL STORM WARNING AND HURRICANE WATCH ARE NOW ISSUED FOR
NORTH OF BAFFIN BAY TO PORT ARANSAS...FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE
HURRICANE MOVES A LITTLE NORTH OF THE FORECAST TRACK.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT SAT AUG 21 1999
 
TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED TONIGHT. FIRST...BRET HAS RAPIDLY
INTENSIFIED TO A CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE
AND THIS IS BASED ON WINDS FROM GPS DROPSONDES RELEASED IN THE
EYEWALL BY THE NOAA RECONNAISSANCE PLANE. WINDS TO 135 KNOTS WERE
MEASURED BY THE SONDES AT 60 METERS ELEVATION. THIS CORRESPONDS TO A
SURFACE WIND OF 115 KNOTS. WINDS OF 149 KNOTS WERE MEASURED AT 888
MB.
 
SECOND...BRET HAS CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHWARD AND FASTER...ABOUT 9 TO
12 KNOTS. THIS INCREASES THE RISK FOR RESIDENTS ALONG THE TEXAS
COAST.  WATCHES AND WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.
 
A MIDDLE-LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN
UNITED STATES.  IF THIS MATERIALIZES...THE RIDGE SHOULD BLOCK THE
NORTHWARD MOTION OF THE HURRICANE AND FORCE IT TO THE WEST. THIS IS
THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF THE TRACK AND GLOBAL MODELS.
THEREFORE...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SLOWS BRET DOWN AND GRADUALLY
TURNS IT TO THE WEST. ON THIS TRACK...THE CENTER OF THE HURRICANE
WILL BE NEAR THE COAST WITHIN THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 24 TO 36
HOURS.  WEATHER CONDITIONS SHOULD BEGIN TO DETERIORATE WELL BEFORE
THAT TIME.
 
DATA CURRENTLY BEING OBTAINED BY THE NOAA GULFSTREAM JET WILL BE
USED IN THE NEXT CYCLE OF NUMERICAL MODELS.

HURRICANE BRET DISCUSSION NUMBER  15
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SUN AUG 22 1999

LATEST REPORTS FROM THE HURRICANE HUNTERS SUGGEST THAT BRET MAY HAVE
STRENGTHENED A LITTLE FURTHER...WITH THE DROPSONDE-MEASURED CENTRAL
PRESSURE DOWN TO 948 MB.  BRETS APPEARANCE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY IS
NOT AS SYMMETRIC AS IT WAS EARLIER.  AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH JUST TO
THE WEST OF THE HURRICANE MAY BE CAUSING SOME EROSION OF THE CLOUD
SHIELD OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  NOTWITHSTANDING...THE INNER
CORE OF BRET APPEARS TO BE UNAFFECTED.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY MAY OCCUR BUT CATEGORY FOUR INTENSITY IS FORECAST TO BE
MAINTAINED UNTIL LANDFALL.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS A MID-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONIC VORTEX NEAR
THE LOWER RIO GRANDE...AND THIS MAY HAVE PUSHED THE HURRICANE A
LITTLE MORE NORTHWARD THAN WAS EXPECTED. CENTER FIXES NOW INDICATE A
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION NEAR 9 KNOTS.  THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE SAMPLING
OF THE STEERING ENVIRONMENT AROUND BRET AND THESE DATA HAVE BEEN
INPUT INTO THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL. A WEAK MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE LIES
ALONG THE NORTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO COAST AND THE GLOBAL MODEL
FORECASTS THIS FEATURE TO PERSIST.  NOT SURPRISINGLY...THE CONSENSUS
OF THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS IS FOR A TURN TO THE LEFT...TOWARD
THE SOUTH TEXAS COAST.   ONLY SLIGHT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE
PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK...AND NO NORTHWARD EXTENSION OF THE
WARNINGS IS DEEMED NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...BASED ON THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE... SHOWS A
SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED.  IF THIS DOES NOT OCCUR THEN THE
CENTER WILL REACH THE COAST SOONER THAN INDICATED.  DO NOT FOCUS ON
THE EXACT TRACK.  EVEN THOUGH BRET IS EXPECTED TO MOVE ONSHORE IN
THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA...IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SPECIFY A PRECISE
POINT AND TIME OF LANDFALL.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 315/09 AND WE MAY BE SEEING THE
BEGINNING OF A TURN TOWARD THE WEST THAT MANY OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS
HAVE BEEN INDICATING FOR SOME TIME.  THE LATEST GUIDANCE CONTINUES
TO INDICATE THAT THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTHWEST OF BRET WILL CAUSE
THE MOTION TO SLOW AND TURN LEFT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
CONTINUES THE INITIAL MOTION FOR 12 HOURS WHICH BRINGS THE CENTER TO
THE COAST.  AFTER THIS THE TRACK FORECAST SLOWS TO LESS THAN 5 KNOTS
WITH A MOSTLY WESTWARD HEADING.  THIS IS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH
THE GFDL MODEL.

THE LATEST RECON CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 944 MB AND WIND
REPORTS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A 120 KNOT HURRICANE.  NO IMPORTANT
CHANGES ARE EXPECTED BEFORE LANDFALL...BUT THERE WILL LIKELY BE
FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY.

DATA BUOY 42020 REPORTED 35 KNOTS FOR THE FIRST TIME AT 12Z WHEN THE
CENTER WAS ABOUT 60 NMI TO THE SOUTHEAST...SO THIS IS THE BASIS FOR
THE 34-KNOT RADIUS IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/07.  THE 500 MB ANTICYCLONE TO THE
NORTHWEST OF THE HURRICANE IS STILL THE MAIN SYNOPTIC FEATURE
AFFECTING THE MOTION.  THE 12Z AVIATION RUN SHOWS THIS FEATURE
RETREATING NORTHWESTWARD A LITTLE AND THE TRACK MODELS RESPOND BY

INDICATES THAT THE LEADING EDGE OF THE 15 MILE DIAMETER EYEWALL IS
ALREADY AT THE COAST.  THE FORECAST THEN CONTINUES A SLOW MOSTLY
WESTWARD MOTION FURTHER INLAND.
 
THE LATEST RECON CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE IS 946 MB SO THE INTENSITY

BRET HAS MADE LANDFALL ALONG THE SOUTH TEXAS COAST MIDWAY BETWEEN
BROWNSVILLE AND CORPUS CHRISTI. ESTIMATED WINDS OF 90 TO 100 MPH
HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AT THE BROWNSVILLE FORECAST OFFICE IN KENNEDY
COUNTY NEAR WHERE THE CROSSED THE COAST. GPS DROPSONDE DATA FROM 
THE U.S. AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATE THAT BRET 
HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS. THE LAST MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED WAS 952 MB...AND USING THE GPS WIND DATA
THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE REDUCED TO 100 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  FURTHER
WEAKENING SHOULD CONTINUE AS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE MOVES SLOWLY
INLAND WITH BRET FORECAST TO WEAKEN BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 
12 HRS.  

RECONNAISSANCE AND WSR-88D RADAR DATA INDICATE THAT BRET HAS SLOWED
DOWN SOMEWHAT DURING THE LAST 6 HOURS AND IS NOW ON A MORE WESTERLY
COURSE...WITH THE INITIAL MOTION OF 280/06 KT.  THE PHILOSOPHY
REGARDING TRACK OF HURRICANE BRET REMAINS UNCHANGED WITH THE MID-
LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE SHOULD PROVIDE A WESTWARD
STEERING COMPONENT THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS 
A GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH 72 HRS WITH A GRADUAL DECELERATION
...THIS IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH BAMD. 

AS A RESULT OF THE SLOW FORWARD MOTION...THE PRIMARY THREAT BRET
WILL POSE THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL BE HEAVY RAINS. RAINFALL
TOTALS OF 10 TO 15 INCHES...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS...ARE
POSSIBLE OVER PORTIONS SOUTH TEXAS AND NORTHERN MEXICO. FURTHER
INFORMATION REGARDING THE RAINFALL THREAT CAN BE FOUND IN LOCAL

TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR DISCUSSION NUMBER   2
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST THU AUG 19 1999
 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVER THE LAST 6 HRS
WITH DEEP CONVECTION...TOPS TO -80C...SOUTH AND WEST OF THE
SUSPECTED LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL NOT VERY WELL
ORGANIZED AND DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES REFLECT...25 KT FROM SAB
AND AFGW AND 35 KT FROM TAFB.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD 
AT 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY. THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE
EASTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ON THE ORDER OF 25-30 KT PER CLOUD
DRIFT WIND DATA.  THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION
SCHEME...SHIPS...CONTINUES TO INDICATE MODEST STRENGTHENING...50 KT
BY 72 HRS...LIMITED BY THE EASTERLY SHEAR CONDITIONS. SINCE THE
SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE HOLDING ITS OWN IN SPITE OF THE SHEAR...THE
INTENSITY TREND FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WILL BE MAINTAINED.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/13 KT WHICH REPRESENTS A SLIGHT
INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED FROM THE LAST ADVISORY.  HOWEVER...THERE
IS STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE CENTER LOCATION
AS DEMONSTRATED IN THE 45-60 NM SPREAD IN THE SATELLITE-BASED FIXES.
THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION WILL
PRODUCE A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. THE 00Z AVN SUGGESTS THAT A WEAKNESS MAY DEVELOP TOWARDS THE
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A BEND TO
THE NORTH AND A DECELERATION BEYOND 48 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST 
TRACK IS SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF PREVIOUS PACKAGE PRIMARILY DUE TO
THE INITIAL POSITION.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR IS
NEAR TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH WITH THE LOW LEVEL CENTER NEAR THE
EASTERN EDGE OF THE CONVECTIVE MASS. HOWEVER...EASTERLY SHEAR
CONTINUES OVER THE SYSTEM AND THE CONVECTIVE CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED
SOME DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS. IF THE CONVECTION PERSISTS...THE
CYCLONE WILL LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM THIS AFTERNOON.

THERE IS STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF SCATTER IN THE SATELLITE-BASED
CENTER LOCATIONS...WHICH PRODUCE A BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MOTION OF
280/10. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO EITHER THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY OR
FORECAST TRACK FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. THE STRONG LOW LEVEL RIDGE
NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION SHOULD KEEP THE SYSTEM ON A WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK...WITH PERHAPS A SLIGHT BEND TO THE NORTH AFTER 48
HOURS DUE TO AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TO THE NORTHWEST.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR HAS MAINTAINED ITSELF AGAINST MODERATE TO
STRONG SHEAR. THE AVN...NOGAPS...AND ECMWF MODELS SUGGEST SOME
DECREASE IN THE SHEAR MAY OCCUR DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD...WHICH
WOULD ALLOW SOME STRENGTHENING. THE FORECAST TRACK TAKES THE CYCLONE
OVER 25C-26C WATER AFTER 36 HOURS...WHICH WOULD LIKELY SLOW OR HALT
INTENSIFICATION. THUS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS UNCHANGED FROM THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR HAS BECOME HARD TO LOCATE DUE
TO A CIRRUS COVER OVER THE LOW LEVEL CENTER. THE EARLIER STRONG
CONVECTION HAS NOT PERSISTED...AND INSTEAD THERE IS BURSTING
CONVECTION CHARACTERISTIC OF A SHEARED SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 35 KT...THIS PACKAGE WILL
KEEP THE SYSTEM A DEPRESSION.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE
CENTER...WITH THE BEST ESTIMATE OF 275/8. DESPITE THIS...THERE IS
LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO...BUT A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND IS DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUITE OF NHC
HURRICANE GUIDANCE.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS ALSO SLIGHTLY CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...AS THE SHEAR AND DECREASE IN CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION
SHOULD SLOW INTENSIFICATION EARLY IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. ALTHOUGH
THE TRACK FORECAST IS FURTHER SOUTH THAN 6 HOURS AGO...IT STILL
PASSES OVER SOME 25C-26C SSTS AFTER 48 HOURS. THUS...LITTLE
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AT THAT TIME.

WHAT LITTLE DATA THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION ARE
SENDING STRONGLY MIXED SIGNALS THIS EVENING.  SATELLITE AND
MICROWAVE IMAGERY...THE LATTER FROM THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY IN
MONTEREY CALIFORNIA...SUGGEST THAT THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION IS
SUFFERING FROM STRONG NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR.  RECENT IMAGES SHOW NO
CONVECTION CLOSE TO THE PRESUMED CENTER.  ON THE OTHER HAND...SHIP
4QUM REPORTED SOUTHWEST WINDS OF 45 KT AT 18Z AND 37 KT AT 00Z.  THE
SECOND REPORT WAS ABOUT 150 NM TO THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST OF THE SYSTEM. 
ALTHOUGH THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE ACCEPTED AS CORRECT...I BELIEVE THEY
REFLECT THE LARGE SCALE FLOW OF THE ITCZ...PERHAPS ENHANCED BY THE
DEPRESSION.  VISIBLE IMAGERY IN THE MORNING WILL DETERMINE WHETHER
THIS ANALYSIS IS CORRECT...OR WHETHER THERE IS A WELL DEFINED
TROPICAL CYCLONE CIRCULATION...WITH THE REQUIRED ORGANIZED
CONVECTION.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 275/8...AND THE TRACK FORECAST
IS MOSTLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  HOWEVER...GIVEN THE
SHEAR...WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO LESSEN...THE INTENSITY FORECAST HAS
BEEN HELD BACK COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

AS IS THE CASE WITH NIGHT TIME IR THE CENTER OF THE TROPICAL
DEPRESSION IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE.  TAFB...SAB AND AIR FORCE
GLOBAL HAVE COME IN WITH POSITIONS A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS

MORNING VISIBLE IMAGERY INDICATES THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION
FOUR IS EXPOSED AT THE NORTHEASTERN EDGE OF THE POORLY ORGANIZED
CONVECTION. ALTHOUGH THE LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN
AT TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY...THE SYSTEM REMAINS A DEPRESSION ON
THIS PACKAGE DUE TO THE RAGGED APPEARANCE AND NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE
SATELLITE SIGNATURE SINCE YESTERDAY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/8. THE AVN MODEL KEEPS A LOW LEVEL RIDGE
NORTH OF THE CYCLONE THROUGH 72 HOURS...WITH A MID/UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE RIDGE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION. THE MODEL
AND AVN-BASED GUIDANCE RESPOND TO THE TROUGH BY TURNING THE SYSTEM
WEST-NORTHWEST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INCLUDES SUCH A TURN AFTER 48
HOURS...BUT NOT AS QUICKLY OR AS FAR NORTH AS THE AVN-BASED
GUIDANCE.

THE AVN AND NOGAPS SUGGEST THE PERSISTENT EASTERLY SHEAR WILL SLOWLY
DECREASE DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD...ALTHOUGH THE SHIPS MODEL STILL
HAS 22 KT SHEAR AT 48 HOURS. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR
GRADUAL STRENGTHENING THROUGH THE PERIOD AS THE SHEAR DECREASES.

KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS STILL UNDER SOME
NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR WHICH IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE.  THEREFORE...A
GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AND CINDY MAY REACH HURRICANE
STATUS BY 72 HOURS OR SO.
 
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/11.  CURRENTLY...THERE IS
A WELL ESTABLISHED MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE. THIS PATTERN WILL MAINTAIN THE WESTWARD TRACK DURING THE
NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS. THEREAFTER...LARGE SCALE MODELS WEAKEN THE

BUT THE BANDING FEATURES ARE STILL NOT VERY WELL DEFINED.  DVORAK T-
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN SLOWLY INCREASING...AND MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
INCREASED TO 50 KNOTS ON THIS ADVISORY.  NORTHEASTERLY SHEARING IS
STILL IMPACTING THE STORM...BUT ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN CIMSS WEB SITE INDICATE WEAKER SHEAR AHEAD.  CINDY IS
LIKELY TO BECOME A HURRICANE DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.

MOTION CONTINUES TOWARD THE WEST AT 9 TO 10 KNOTS.  THERE IS A
WEAKNESS IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC SUBTROPICAL RIDGE IN THE VICINITY
OF 30W...WHICH IS PROBABLY CAUSING THE SLOWER-THAN-CLIMATOLOGICAL
WESTWARD MOTION OF CINDY.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL FORECAST SHOWS THIS
WEAKNESS BECOMING LESS DISTINCT WITH TIME...WITH AN EAST-SOUTHEAST
TO WEST-NORTHWEST RIDGE AT 500 MB ORIENTED NORTH OF CINDY IN 2-3

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST SUN AUG 22 1999
 
DURING THE PAST SIX HOURS INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT
CINDY HAS BEEN SHEARED WITH THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER
EXPOSED...AND LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION. 
T-NUMBERS ARE NOW 4.0/3.5 FROM SAB AND MIAMI RESPECTIVELY...BUT CI
NUMBERS REMAIN AT 4.0/4.5 AS PER DEVORAK CONSTRAINTS.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL REMAIN AT 65 KNOTS AND WE WILL SEE IF THE SHEAR IS
JUST TEMPORARY.  THE SHIPS GUIDANCE RECOGNIZES THE SHEAR BUT STILL
FORECASTS CINDY TO STRENGTHEN IN TIME...AS DOES THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/8. THE GLOBAL MODELS NOW SUGGEST
THAT THE MID TO UPPER LEVEL WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF
CINDY...THAT WAS MOVING CINDY TO THE NORTHWEST IN THE LATER FORECAST
PERIODS... IS NOT GOING TO AFFECT THE TRACK OF CINDY AS MUCH.  ALL
OF THE TRACK MODELS HAVE LESS OF A NORTHERLY COMPONENT AND ALL 72
HOUR POSITIONS ARE NOW SOUTH OF 20 DEGREES NORTH.  THE CURRENT
FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS...AND THE 72 HOUR
FORECAST POSITION IS VERY CLOSE TO THE GFDL AND SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT CINDY IS UNDER STRONG
EASTERLY SHEAR.  THE CENTER IS PARTIALLY EXPOSED AND IS LOCATED
JUST TO THE EAST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THE INITIAL POSITION HAS
BEEN ADJUSTED SOMEWHAT TO THE EAST.  CINDY MAY BE BARELY A
HURRICANE SINCE SOME OF THE SATELLITE ESTIMATES ARE BELOW 65 KNOTS.
HOWEVER...WE ARE KEEPING THE SAME INTENSITY AT THIS TIME UNTIL A
MORE VISIBLE PICTURES BECOME AVAILABLE.  ASSUMING THE SHEAR WILL
RELAX...AS CINDY MOVES AWAY FROM THE STRONG 200 MB EASTERLY
AFRICAN JET...SOME SLOW STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.   SHIPS MODEL
CONTINUES TO INDICATE STRONG EASTERLY SHEAR AND KEEPS CINDY WITH 65
KNOTS. 
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 280/06.  IN GENERAL...TRACK GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A
SLOW WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH 36 HOURS AND THEN SPLIT.  SOME MODELS
INDICATE A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK WHILE THE BAM MODELS CONTINUE WITH A
GENERAL WEST OR EVEN WEST SOUTHWEST TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MODEL ENSEMBLE AND IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ONE.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT CINDY IS UNDER STRONG
EASTERLY SHEAR.  THE CENTER IS EXPOSED AND LOCATED WELL TO THE EAST
OF THE CONVECTION BUT THE SYSTEM...AS A WHOLE...HAS A LARGE CYCLONIC
ENVELOPE.   BASED ON THE WEAKENING STRUCTURE OF THE CLOUD PATTERN...
CINDY IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS AT THIS TIME.
BECAUSE CINDY IS MOVING SLOWLY AND THE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE NOT
FORECAST TO CHANGE...RELATIVELY STRONG SHEAR WILL CONTINUE OVER THE
SYSTEM.  AT THIS TIME...WINDS ARE KEPT AT 55 KNOTS THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD.

THE CENTER HAS BEEN MOVING VERY SLOWLY WESTWARD...IT APPEARS THAT
THE SYSTEM IS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOW-LEVEL AFRICAN
MONSOON-TYPE FLOW. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALL FOR A SLOW WESTWARD
TRACK DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS WITH SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED THEREAFTER. THIS IS BASICALLY THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF
THE TRACK AND GLOBAL MODELS.

CINDY REMAINS IN A HIGHLY SHEARED STATE...WITH THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER
OFF TO THE EAST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THE AVN SUGGESTS THAT THE
STRONG EASTERLY SHEAR WILL CONTINUE...AND SO RESTRENGTHENING SEEMS
UNLIKELY...AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM.  ALTHOUGH RECENT SATELLITE
IMAGES SHOW AN INCREASE IN THE CONVECTION...THIS IS BELIEVED TO BE
TEMPORARY.  INTENSITY IS DROPPED TO 50 KT AT THIS ADVISORY BASED ON
FALLING DVORAK T NUMBERS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 290/6...A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE
PREVIOUS MOTION.  THE GUIDANCE IS SOMEWHAT SPLIT INTO TWO
CAMPS...WITH THE BAM MODELS INDICATING A WESTWARD TRACK AT VARYING
SPEEDS RELATED TO THE UPPER-LEVEL EASTERLY SHEAR...AND THE REMAINING
MODELS...INCLUDING GFDL...NOGAPS...AND UKMET...INDICATING A WEST-
NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SPLITS THE
DIFFERENCE.  IF CINDY BECOMES COMPLETELY DETACHED FROM THE DEEP

EASTERLY SHEAR CONTINUES TO AFFECT CINDY.  ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER HAS RECENTLY BECOME MORE INVOLVED WITH THE
DEEP CONVECTION...WHICH WOULD IMPLY SOME RE-STRENGTHENING...THIS IS
NOT CERTAIN.  THEREFORE THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS KEPT AT 50
KNOTS.  THE KEY TO THE FUTURE INTENSITY OF CINDY IS THE VERTICAL
SHEAR.  ONCE THE STORM MOVES WEST OF ABOUT 40W LONGITUDE...I.E. MORE
INTO THE LOW-LEVEL EASTERLY TRADEWIND ENVIRONMENT...THE EASTERLY
SHEAR SHOULD DIMINISH SOMEWHAT.  HOWEVER BECAUSE OF OUR LIMITATIONS
IN PREDICTING INTENSITY CHANGE...ONLY SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IS SHOWN
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  

CENTER FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE SOMEWHAT SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS
TRACK.  IT IS PRUDENT NOT TO MAKE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITH
INFRARED IMAGERY HOWEVER.  BASED ON CONTINUITY...IT IS PRESUMED THAT
THE CENTER IS NEAR THE EAST-NORTHEASTERN EDGE OF THE DENSE OVERCAST.
THIS GIVES AN ESTIMATED INITIAL MOTION OF 285/07...CLOSE TO THAT
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  

THE 00Z AVN RUN OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE BUILDING WESTWARD FROM THE EASTERN TO THE CENTRAL
ATLANTIC OVER THE NEXT 2-3 DAYS.  IF THIS VERIFIES...CINDY SHOULD
MAINTAIN A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS GENERALLY SHOW
THIS AS WELL.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ONE.

...CORRECTION FOR 72 HOUR POSITION...
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/09.  THE 12 AVIATION MODEL SHOWS
A SLIGHT WEAKNESS AHEAD OF THE STORM IN THE 500 MB RIDGE.  THIS IS
CAUSING ALL OF THE TRACK FORECAST MODELS TO CONTINUE A WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS WITH SOME ACCELERATION.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE NORTH OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

THE STORM CONTINUES TO BE SHEARED WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION DISPLACED
TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER WHICH IS NOT VERY WELL
DEFINED.  SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF 50 KNOTS IS NOT CHANGED FOR 36
HOURS.  AT 48 AND 72 HOURS...THE FORECAST IS FOR SLIGHT
STRENGTHENING AS THE SHIPS MODEL FORECASTS A WEAKENING OF THE
VERTICAL SHEAR.

THE WIND SPEED RADII ARE ADJUSTED TO SHOW THE STRONGEST WINDS IN THE
SOUTHWEST QUADRANT...BUT THE RADII ARE FORECAST TO BECOME SOMEWHAT
MORE SYMMETRIC AT 36 HOURS.

TROPICAL STORM CINDY DISCUSSION NUMBER  26
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT WED AUG 25 1999

BASED ON DVORAK T-NUMBERS...CINDY HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN INTENSITY. 
HOWEVER THE CLOUD PATTERN APPEARS TO HAVE BECOME A LITTLE MORE
SYMMETRIC WHICH SUGGESTS THAT STRENGTHENING IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. 
THIS IS NOT SURPRISING SINCE THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS NOW FAIRLY WEAK
AND THE UNDERLYING WATERS ARE BECOMING WARMER.  THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY FORECAST IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE STATISTICAL
MODEL...SHIPS.

THE CENTER POSITION IS NOT OBVIOUS FROM INFRARED IMAGERY...BUT THERE
IS SOME SUGGESTION THAT THE STORM IS MOVING A BIT MORE
NORTHWESTWARD.  HOWEVER FOR THE SAKE OF CONTINUITY...THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOT ADJUSTED MUCH FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  AN
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IN THE VICINITY OF 55W NORTH OF 20N WOULD INDUCE
A MORE NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION IF IT REMAINS IN PLACE. 
HOWEVER THIS FEATURE IS LIKELY TO MIGRATE WESTWARD...AND WITH A
SUBSTANTIAL 500 MB RIDGE ALONG 30N TO THE NORTH OF CINDY...A
CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION IS LIKELY.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THIS IS
ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE AS WELL.

THE CONVECTIVE APPEARANCE OF CINDY IS A LITTLE RAGGED THIS MORNING
AND SO THE INTENSITY IS HELD AT 55 KT.  CONDITIONS STILL APPEAR
FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO
SHIPS MODEL GUIDANCE.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 295/13...JUST A BIT TO THE RIGHT OF
THE PREVIOUS MOTION.  OOZ AVN BUILDS THE MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE AHEAD OF
CINDY AND SO THE MODEL GUIDANCE...ESPECIALLY GFDL...HINTS AT A MORE
WESTERLY TRACK LATE IN THE PERIOD.  HOWEVER...THE O6Z AVN INDICATES
A MUCH WEAKER RIDGE AND A MORE NORTHWESTWARD TRACK.  OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SHIFTED JUST A BIT TO THE RIGHT AT THIS TIME...UNTIL THE
MODEL TREND CAN BE CONFIRMED.

RING OF BROKEN CONVECTION AND SOME BANDING TO THE SOUTH.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 55 AND 65 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...SO WE WILL

THE INITIAL MOTION CONTINUES TO BEND TO THE RIGHT...AND CINDY IS NOW
MOVING AT 305/14.  06 AND 12Z AVN RUNS ARE CONSISTENT WITH A
RELATIVELY WEAK MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE THAT SHOULD ALLOW A MOSTLY

IN INTENSITY OVERNIGHT.  DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE 4.0...65 KNOTS. 
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW LOOKS STRONG OVER ALL BUT THE SOUTHWEST PORTION
OF THE HURRICANE.  STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AS IN THE LAST

SURFACE TEMPS SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE ALONG THE TRACK OF CINDY
UNTIL THE SYSTEM REACHES ABOUT 30N LATITUDE...THEREFORE THE
INTENSITY IS FORECAST TO LEVEL OFF NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST

AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ALONG 55-60W HAS BEEN PULLING CINDY MORE

MOVEMENT SHOULD CONTINUE AS SUGGESTED BY THE U.K. MET OFFICE

LOOKING BETTER WITH TIME.  SINCE MANY HURRICANES REACH THEIR MAXIMUM
INTENSITY NEAR THEIR LATITUDE OF RECURVATURE IT APPEARS THAT CINDY

NORTHEAST.
 
THE SYSTEM IS SLOWING DOWN AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE WEAKNESS IN THE
MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE.  INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 315/12.  MODEL
GUIDANCE REMAINS FAIRLY UNANIMOUS ON THE RECURVATURE BETWEEN 31 AND

OBJECTIVE DVORAK ESTIMATES USING THE UW-CIMSS ALGORITHM SHOW THAT
THE INTENSITY OF CINDY PEAKED THIS MORNING.  A RECENT 3-HR AVERAGE
OF 5.9 SUPPORTS ABOUT 115 KT.  CI NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 127
AND 115 KT...RESPECTIVELY.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN AT
120 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE BUT WILL PROBABLY BE LOWERED TONIGHT.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS STILL 335/8.  THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE
IN EITHER THE TRACK FORECAST PHILOSOPHY AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
MERELY UPDATES THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  ALL GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT
CINDY WILL RECURVE INTO THE WESTERLIES WITHIN 24 HOURS AND
ACCELERATE THEREAFTER.  THE FORECAST CALLS FOR CINDY TO BECOME
EXTRATROPICAL AT 72 HOURS.

THE RADII OF THE 12 FOOT SEAS HAVE BEEN EXPANDED BASED ON NUMEROUS

THE HEADING HAS SHIFTED TOWARD THE RIGHT OVER THE PAST FEW

THERE ARE MIXED SIGNALS AS TO THE ORGANIZATION OF TROPICAL
DEPRESSION FIVE THIS MORNING. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB AND SAB ARE 35 KT AND 30 KT RESPECTIVELY...AND THIS IS
SUPPORTED BY A 35 KT REPORT FROM SHIP WZJF. HOWEVER...THE WIND
DIRECTION AT THIS SOUTH-SOUTHEASTWARD-MOVING SHIP IS UNCHANGED OVER
THE PAST SIX HOURS. THIS SUGGESTS A POORLY DEFINED OR ELONGATED
CIRCULATION. SHIP 3FOB5...LOCATED ABOUT 70 MILES WEST OF THE
ESTIMATED CENTER...SUPPORTS THIS IDEA BY REPORTING EAST WINDS 5 KT.
THE SYSTEM WILL REMAIN A DEPRESSION ON THIS PACKAGE. AN AIR FORCE
RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT WILL INVESTIGATE THE DEPRESSION
STARTING AT 12Z.

THERE ARE SEVERAL FEATURES BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CONVECTION
THAT LOOK LIKE CENTERS...THUS THE LOCATION CONFIDENCE AND THE
INITIAL MOTION CONFIDENCE ARE LOW. THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS AT
295/7 FOR THIS ADVISORY. GLOBAL MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WEAKENING THE RIDGE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION AS A MID-LATITUDE TROUGH
DIGS SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE EASTERN U.S. THESE INDICATE THE CYCLONE
MAKING A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST THROUGH 72 HOURS... WITH A
TRACK OVER OR JUST EAST OF THE EASTERN BAHAMAS. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY
NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE. THE GFDL...WHICH SIX HOURS AGO WAS CALLING
FOR A MUCH MORE WESTWARD TRACK...IS NOW IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE
GUIDANCE. THIS MAY BE THE RESULT OF THE NOAA JET MISSION YESTERDAY.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO...BUT A LITTLE LEFT
OF...THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE UPPER LEVEL IN ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO LOOK FAVORABLE FOR
INTENSIFICATION...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR SUCH IN
AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS MODEL. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE
SYSTEM MAY STRENGTHEN FASTER THAN FORECAST...ESPECIALLY AFTER
REACHING HURRICANE INTENSITY.
 
GIVEN THE LOCATION AND INTENSITY UNCERTAINTIES...AND THAT THE
SOUTHWEST SIDE OF THE SYSTEM IS STILL WEAK...NO WARNINGS OR WATCHES
WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE BAHAMAS OR THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS AT
THIS TIME. HOWEVER...THESE MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY.

AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE HAS BEEN IN THE AREA OF THE
DEPRESSION AND SO FAR IT HAS FOUND A BROAD ILL DEFINED CIRCULATION
WITH STRONG GUSTY WINDS WELL TO THE EAST THE POSSIBLE CENTER. U.S.
NAVY BUOYS ALSO INDICATE A BROAD CIRCULATION AND SURFACE PRESSURES
OF THE ORDER OF 1008 MB...A DROP OF ABOUT 8 MB IN 24 HOURS. NORMALLY
THIS IS AN INDICATION OF A DEVELOPING SYSTEM.  BECAUSE THE CENTER IS
POORLY ORGANIZED...THE INITIAL MOTION IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND THERE
PROBABLY WILL BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS OF THE LOCATION AND THE MOTION
WHILE THE SYSTEM IS ORGANIZING. GLOBAL MODELS REMOVE THE CURRENT
SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM AND FORECAST A VERY FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR
THE DEPRESSION TO STRENGTHEN. THE DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO BE A
HURRICANE BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. 

BEST ESTIMATE OF MOTION OF THE BROAD CIRCULATION IS 290/08.  MOST OF
THE MODELS BRING A MID-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES
AND THIS WOULD CREATE A PATTERN FOR THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO TURN
GRADUALLY NORTHWARD.  HOWEVER...THIS TURN IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR 
CLOSE TO THE COAST...THEREFORE RESIDENTS ALONG THE SOUTHEASTERN
UNITED STATES COAST SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
SYSTEM.

11 PM EDT TUE AUG 24 1999

SATELLITE PICTURES THIS EVENING SHOW THAT CIRCULATION OF DENNIS
REMAINS BROAD AND ILL-DEFINED. THE U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE
HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS CURRENTLY GATHERING DATA IN THE CYCLONE.  THE
LATEST VORTEX MESSAGE FROM THIS MISSION INDICATES THAT THE CENTER
IS A TAD SOUTH AND WEST OF THE LAST ADVISORY POSITION. THIS PLACES
THE CENTER WEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION. HOWEVER...RECENT SATELLITE
IMAGERY SUGGESTS THE CENTER MAY BE RE-FORMING TO THE EAST OF THE
RECON POSITION. WITH THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY AND BROAD NATURE
OF THE SURFACE CIRCULATION THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/10 KTS
...WHICH IS BASED ON A 24-HR MEAN.  

ALL OF THE NUMERICAL MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE EVOLUTION
OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS. THIS WOULD RESULT IN A NORTHWEST MOTION FOLLOWED BY
A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH BY LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. MOST OF
THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS REFLECT THIS SCENARIO...AS DOES THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THE NHC TRACK IS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE
GUIDANCE AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST GFDL OUTPUT. THIS
IS ALSO SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY MAINLY DUE TO THE
INITIAL MOTION/POSITION ESTIMATE. 

THE UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW OVER DENNIS APPEARS WELL-ESTABLISHED.
ANALYSES FROM CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SHOW LIGHT 
SHEAR CONDITIONS AND THE GLOBAL MODELS FORECAST AN UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGE OVER THE CYCLONE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE INTENSITY
FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND CALLS FOR
GRADUAL STRENGTHENING.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAKES THE NORTHWARD TURN CLOSE TO THE U.S.
SOUTHEAST COAST POSING A POTENTIAL THREAT TO GEORGIA AND THE
CAROLINAS. THEREFORE...RESIDENTS ALONG THE ENTIRE SOUTHEASTERN
UNITED STATES COAST SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
SYSTEM.

THE POORLY-DEFINED CENTER OF DENNIS REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON
INFRARED IMAGERY...BUT APPEARS TO STILL BE EXPOSED WEST OF THE MAIN
CONVECTION. SATELLITE CENTER LOCATIONS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE OVER 60
MILES APART...WHICH ADDS TO THE LOW LOCATION CONFIDENCE. THE INITIAL
MOTION FOR THIS PACKAGE IS SET TO 285/7 AND THE MAXIMUM WINDS REMAIN
40 KT.

THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL WAS WEAKER WITH THE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH...
WITH THE RESULT THAT AVN-BASED GUIDANCE TAKES THE STORM FURTHER WEST
THAN 6 HOURS AGO. THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST REFLECTS THIS AND
ADJUSTS THE TRACK TO THE LEFT AND SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE. IT IS NOTEWORTHY THE AVN IS THE WEAKEST MODEL WITH THE
TROUGH...AS THE NOGAPS...UKMET...AND ECMWF MODELS USE A STRONGER
TROUGH TO TURN DENNIS MORE QUICKLY NORTHWARD.

DESPITE THE ANTICYCLONE OVER DENNIS...THE CONVECTION IS DISPLACED
EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER AS IF THE SYSTEM IS SHEARED. IT MAY
BE THAT AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS IS
PRODUCING A NORTHWESTERLY FLOW THAT IS UNDERCUTTING DENNIS'
ANTICYCLONE. THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS REDUCED BY 5 KT FROM THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE TO REFLECT THE SLOWER THAN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT TO
THIS TIME.
 
THE NEW FORECAST TRACK REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE WATCHES AND WARNINGS
IN THE BAHAMAS. ADDITIONALLY...RESIDENTS ALONG THE ENTIRE
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES COAST SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS
OF THIS SYSTEM.

RECON INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE PRESSURE DECREASED ONLY TO 1004
MB...NOT MUCH SINCE YESTERDAY. HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE
IMAGES INDICATE THAT CENTER OF DENNIS IS BETTER DEFINED TODAY BUT
STILL PARTIALLY EXPOSED AND LOCATED TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE
CONVECTION. DESPITE MODELS FORECASTING A 200 MB ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
SYSTEM...IT HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET AND SHEAR CONTINUES. 
HOWEVER...THE OVERALL OUTFLOW IS NOW BEGINNING TO BECOME BETTER
ESTABLISHED...AS FORECAST BY GLOBAL MODELS AND CONVECTION CONTINUES
TO INCREASE.  BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL MODELS STRENGTHEN THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE.  THEREFORE...DENNIS IS FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE BY 36
HOURS OR SO.
 
DENNIS IS NEARLY STATIONARY AS INDICATED BY RECON DATA...PERHAPS
BECAUSE IT IS STILL IN A FORMATIVE STAGE BUT IS FORECAST TO RESUME A
SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK LATER TODAY. THE MAIN PLAYER IS THE LARGE
MID-TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST BY GLOBAL MODELS TO BE
ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.  THE TIMING OF THE INTERACTION OF
THE TROUGH WITH DENNIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT MAY DETERMINE IF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE EVENTUALLY MOVES NORTHWARD OR NOT.  IF DENNIS
CONTINUES TO MOVE LITTLE AND MISSES THE TROUGH...THIS WOULD GIVE
TIME FOR THE LARGE SCALE PATTERN TO CHANGE IN THE LONGER TERM.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK WITH A GRADUAL TURN
TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST AHEAD OF THE TROUGH...WHICH IS
THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO AT THIS TIME.   THIS TRACK IS IN BETWEEN
TWO SOLUTIONS...GFDL WITH BAM... AND NOGAPS WITH UK...MODELS.

...CORRECTION TO PARAGRAPH TWO...DANNY TO DENNIS... 

THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH DENNIS IS GRADUALLY IMPROVING 
IN ORGANIZATION.  THE CENTER IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION
AND THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS WELL DEFINED IN ALL QUADRANTS.
HOWEVER...THERE ARE STILL LOW-CLOUDS MOVING AWAY FROM THE
CIRCULATION IN THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE STORM.  EARLIER
INFORMATION FROM THE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE REVEALED THAT THE CENTER
HAD GRADUALLY SHIFTED EASTWARD UNDER THE CONVECTION...INDICATING
STRENGTHENING...AND INDEED...PRESSURE DROPPED TO 1000 MB AND WINDS
INCREASED TO 55 KNOTS.  GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO FORECAST A 200 MB
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM AND THIS APPEARS TO BE MATERIALIZING.
THIS PATTERN WOULD CREATE VERY FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR
INTENSIFICATION. IN FACT...BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL BRING DENNIS TO 
ABOUT 90 TO 95 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.  SINCE THESE MODELS ARE THE BEST
GUIDANCE AVAILABLE...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A 
95-KNOT HURRICANE BY 72 HOURS.

DENNIS HAS BEEN MOVING LITTLE WHILE REORGANIZING.  HOWEVER...A SLOW
WEST-NORTHWEST GRADUAL TRACK SHOULD BEGIN TONIGHT. LATEST RUN FROM
GLOBAL AND TRACK MODELS CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT THE TROUGH ALONG
THE EAST COAST WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO STEER DENNIS NORTHWEST AND
NORTHWARD.  CONSEQUENTLY...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH INDICATE THE PRIMARY THREAT IS NORTHWARD
TOWARD THE CAROLINAS.

THE LATEST AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER CENTER FIX SUGGESTS
THAT DENNIS HAS BEGUN TO DRIFT WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...AS ANTICIPATED
IN THE LAST ADVISORY PACKAGE. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW
300/3 KTS. THE SYNOPTIC REASONING BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST IS
UNCHANGED AS THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
SHOULD GRADUALLY STEER DENNIS ON A GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING BEFORE
PULLING THE CYCLONE NORTHWARD AFTER 48 HRS. THE 00Z TRACK MODEL
SUITE GENERALLY SUPPORTS THIS SCENARIO.  BAMD CONTINUES TO BE THE
LEFT-MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE WHILE NOGAPS MOVES DENNIS ON A
GENERAL SLOW NORTHWARD TRACK THROUGH 72 HRS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WITH LBAR AND THE 18Z GFDL RUN.  THIS TRACK IS SLIGHTLY RIGHT OF 
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY MAINLY DUE TO THE INITIAL MOTION/POSITION
ESTIMATE.  ANOTHER SYNOPTIC FLOW MISSION IS BEING FLOWN THIS EVENING
BY THE NOAA G-IV AND P-3 AIRCRAFT TO COLLECT UPPER LEVEL DATA AROUND
DENNIS. THIS DATA WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE 00Z NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL SUITE.
 
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT RECENTLY REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE
OF 998 MB...A 10 MB DROP OVER THE LAST 24 HRS...AND WINDS OF 67 KTS
AT 1500 FEET. THIS SUPPORTS MAINTAINING THE INITIAL INTENSITY AT
55 KTS. THE LATEST RECON FIX AS WELL AS SATELLITE ANIMATION SHOWS
THAT THE CIRCULATION CENTER IS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE SYSTEM IS EXPERIENCING SOME
NORTHWESTERLY WIND SHEAR...AND ANALYSES FROM CIMSS/UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN SUPPORTING THIS. THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL ALSO
ACKNOWLEDGES THE SHEAR. HOWEVER...WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED OUTFLOW
AND FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL CONDITIONS FORECAST TO EVOLVE...GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST IN LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS.
 
THE 21Z REPORT FROM BUOY 41651 SHOWED 42 KT WINDS.  THIS DATA ALONG
WITH THE LATEST HRD WIND ANALYSIS WERE USED TO ADJUST THE WIND RADII
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK STILL BRINGS DENNIS FAR ENOUGH WEST
TO POSE A THREAT TO THE SOUTHEAST U.S...ESPECIALLY THE CAROLINAS...
LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE SOUTHEAST

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT FOUND 80 KT WINDS
NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER OF DENNIS...ONCE AT FLIGHT LEVEL AND ONCE ON
A DROPSONDE. THE LAST REPORTED MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS 995 MB.
DENNIS IS THUS UPGRADED TO A 65 KT HURRICANE. THE HURRICANE STILL
APPEARS RAGGED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...WITH THE LOW LEVEL CENTER NEAR
THE WEST EDGE OF THE CONVECTION.

BASED ON THE LAST TWELVE HOURS OF RECONNAISSANCE FIXES...THE INITIAL
MOTION IS 300/4. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE SYNOPTIC SITUATION OR
THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. ALL GUIDANCE...
SAVE FOR THE BAMD AND BAMM WHICH CALL FOR A CONTINUING WEST-
NORTHWEST MOTION...HAVE DENNIS RESPONDING TO THE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH
WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH AND SOME ACCELERATION DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD. THE GFDL IS THE FASTEST MOVING THE CYCLONE
NORTHWARD...BRINGING IT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST BY 72 HOURS.
GIVEN HOW DENNIS HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO MOVE AS FAST AS THE GUIDANCE
HAS SUGGESTED FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS MORE
CONSERVATIVE AND IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

WHILE THE AVIATION...NOGAPS...AND SHIPS MODELS INDICATE LIGHT SHEAR
OVER THE SYSTEM...THE SHEARED APPEARANCE AND CIRRUS CLOUDS BLOWING
EASTWARD AND NORTHEASTWARD TOWARD THE CENTER SUGGEST THE ENVIRONMENT
IS NOT QUITE AS FAVORABLE AS THE MODELS THINK. SINCE DENNIS HAS
INTENSIFIED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS
FOR CONTINUED SLOW INTENSIFICATION.

RECONNAISSANCE DATA SHOW A VERY ASYMMETRIC WIND FIELD AND THEY ARE
THE BASIS FOR THE ADJUSTED INITIAL WIND RADII. THE FORECAST WIND
RADII ARE A BLEND OF THE INITIAL CONDITIONS AND THE ANTICIPATION OF
THE WIND FIELD BECOMING MORE SYMMETRIC AS DENNIS INTENSIFIES.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK CONTINUES TO BRING DENNIS FAR ENOUGH
WEST TO POSE A THREAT TO THE SOUTHEAST U.S...ESPECIALLY THE

DENNIS CONTINUES TO BE WITHIN A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT AND REALLY...IT
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A TYPICAL HURRICANE ON SATELLITE IMAGES.  THE
ONLY SIGN OF POSSIBLE STRENGTHENING WAS A REPORT FROM THE LATEST
RECON SUGGESTING THE FORMATION OF A PARTIAL EYEWALL.  WE HAVE BEEN
FORECASTING THE POSSIBLE INTENSIFICATION OF DENNIS...ASSUMING A
RELAXATION OF THE SHEAR... AS PREDICTED BY THE MODELS...BUT THE FACT
IS...THAT THE SHEAR CONTINUES OVER THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  HOWEVER...
I CAN NOT IGNORE SHIPS MODEL WHICH BRINGS DENNIS TO A 95 KNOTS AND
THE GFDL THAT DROPS THE PRESSURE TO 930 MB BY 72 HOURS. 
CONSEQUENTLY...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST MAKES DENNIS A 95
KNOT-HURRICANE BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  
 
THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY DURING MOST OF THE DAY. 
THE MID TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED STATES
APPEARS TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO STEER DENNIS NORTHWEST AND NORTHWARD
DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS.  AS A RESULT OF THE TROUGH...DYNAMICAL
MODELS ARE CONSISTENTLY INDICATING A NORTHWEST AND NORTHWARD TURN
BEYOND 36 HOURS.  LATEST AVN RUN IS NOW IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE

THE CLOUD PATTERN OF DENNIS STILL REFLECTS A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT.
THE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER CENTRAL CUBA IS RESTRICTING THE
OUTFLOW SOMEWHAT OVER THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  MEANWHILE...THE
OUTFLOW OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE HAS IMPROVED MARKEDLY OVER THE
LAST 12-24 HRS WITH WATER VAPOR IMAGERY HINTING AT THE DEVELOPMENT
OF AN UPPER LOW NEAR 23N60W. THERE HAVE BEEN NO INDICATIONS OF
FURTHER STRENGTHENING THIS EVENING WITH THE LATEST REPORTS RELAYED
FROM THE AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT SHOWING THAT THE CENTRAL
PRESSURE HAS RISEN SLIGHTLY...TO 992 MB. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO NOAA
P-3 RADAR IMAGERY...AND TRMM SATELLITE IMAGERY...EARLIER THIS
AFTERNOON WHICH SUGGESTED THE FORMATION OF A PARTIAL EYEWALL
FEATURE. ALTHOUGH THESE ARE CONFLICTING SIGNS...THE CENTER IS MORE 
INVOLVED WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION THAN 24 HRS AGO. THEREFORE...WE 
WILL CALL FOR GRADUAL STRENGTHENING...CONTINGENT ON THE VERTICAL
SHEAR DIMINISHING...CONSISTENT WITH THE LAST ADVISORY AND IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS AND THE GFDL. THE TROPICAL STORM-FORCE WIND
RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED USING THE LATEST HRD ANALYSIS.  
 
THE LATEST RECON FIXES INDICATE THAT DENNIS IS DRIFTING TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE...USING A 12-24 HR MEAN...IS
300/05 KTS. ALTHOUGH STEERING CURRENTS ARE RELATIVELY WEAK AT THIS
TIME...DENNIS SHOULD BEGIN TO RESPOND TO THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THE COLD
LOW PROGED TO CUT OFF OVER THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE SHOULD PULL THE
CYCLONE MORE TO THE NORTH NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY 
AND IS MIDWAY BETWEEN NOGAPS AND THE UKMET. THE GFDL IS SOMEWHAT
TO THE LEFT OF THIS TRACK.  

AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNEMT OF THE BAHAMAS...A TROPICAL
STORM WARNING WILL BE ISSUED FOR NEW PROVIDENCE...GRADN BAHAMA AND
THE BERRY ISLANDS.

ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST...PRIMARILY GEORIA AND THE
CAROLINAS...SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
HURRICANE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/06 BASED ON RECON FIXES.  THE 00Z
AVIATION MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB CUT OFF LOW DROPPING INTO THE
NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO IN 72 HOURS AND THIS FORCES THE BAM MODELS
TO MOVE THE HURRICANE RATHER CLOSE TO THE CENTRAL FLORIDA EAST COAST
BEFORE TURNING NORTHWARD.  ALL OF THE OTHER MODELS KEEP THE
HURRICANE FURTHER EAST WHICH KEEPS THE HIGHEST THREAT TO THE
CAROLINAS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY BUT SHIFTED SLIGHTLY WEST OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AT 24
THROUGH 48 HOURS IN RESPONSE TO THE SIGNAL OF THE AVIATION MODEL. 
THE FORECAST TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE LATEST GFDL MODEL AND TO THE LEFT
OF THE UKMET...NOGAPS...LBAR AND HPC FORECAST.  THE FORECAST TRACK
TAKES THE HURRICANE TO THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS IN 24 HOURS AND
HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE IN EFFECT FOR THIS AREA.
 
THE LAST RECON MISSION REPORTED MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS IN THE 65
KNOT RANGE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT DENNIS MAY HAVE WEAKENED SLIGHTLY.
BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN EXCELLENT BURSTING CDO PATTERN FOR THE PAST
FEW HOURS AND THE RECON CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 988 MB...DOWN 5
MB IN 6 HOURS.  ALSO THE RECON MISSION REPORTED AN EYEWALL FORMING.
THIS IS ALL IN THE FACE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE WESTERLY SHEAR WHICH
HAD BEEN IMPINGING ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CIRCULATION.  SO RATHER
THAN DECREASE THE WIND SPEED TO 65 KNOTS...THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS
KEPT AT 70 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST...AS BEFORE...IS FOR SLOW
STRENGHTENING FOLLOWING THE SHIPS MODEL...THE ANTICIPATION OF LIGHT
VERTICAL SHEAR AND CONTINUED WARM SSTS.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK SHOWS THE HIGHEST THREAT TO THE CAROLINAS...BUT
THE FORECAST TRACK IS UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE TO FLORIDA AND ALL
INTERESTS ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST...FROM FLORIDA THROUGH NORTH
CAROLINA SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
HURRICANE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT FRI AUG 27 1999

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
DENNIS IS FINALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED WHILE THE SHEAR APPEARS
TO BE RELAXING BUT A MID-TO UPPER LEVEL HIGH...CENTERED OVER WESTERN
CUBA...IS STILL INTERFERING WITH THE OUTFLOW OF DENNIS.  THE CENTER
IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION AND THE OUTFLOW IS NOW IN ALL
QUADRANTS. CONSEQUENTLY T-NUMBERS ARE UP TO 5.O AND 4.5 ON THE
DVORAK SCALE.  HOWEVER...LATEST FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT MINIMUM PRESSURE REMAINS 988 MB
WITH A 20 NMI EYE BUT WINDS NO HIGHER THAT 70 KNOTS.  INITIAL
INTENSITY CONTINUES AT 70 KNOTS AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO OPTION BUT
TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING BECAUSE BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL MODELS DO SO. 
ACTUALLY... THESE MODELS ARE THE ONLY TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THE
FORECASTER. 
  
DENNIS STILL MOVING 300/06.  THE TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED
STATES IS FORECAST TO LIFT OUT WHILE A LOW IS EXPECTED TO FORM OVER
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.  THIS PATTERN SUGGESTS THAT DENNIS SHOULD
MOVE SLOWLY WHILE GRADUALLY TURNING TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH-
NORTHWEST DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS PARALLELING THE EAST FLORIDA COAST.

THIS MEANS THAT THE HURRICANE WILL BE THREATENING THE UNITED STATED
SOUTHEAST COAST FOR A FEW DAYS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE
GUIDANCE PRIMARILY THE GFDL.  LATEST RUN FROM THE AVN SHOWS A TRACK
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE NORTH FLORIDA COAST BUT I WILL NOT BE
SURPRISE IF THE FORECAST SWINGS BACK TO THE RIGHT LATER ON...AS THE
MODEL HAS BEEN DOING LATELY.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
DENNIS IS MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED THAN YESTERDAY...IN FACT IT IS
BETTER THAT IT IS EVER BEEN SO FAR.   IT HAS AN EYE TYPE FEATURE AND
WELL DEFINED UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW...BUT A LITTLE BIT RESTRICTED TO
THE WEST.  HOWEVER...GROUND TRUTH OBSERVATIONS FROM THE LATEST A
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE A FEW HOURS AGO INDICATE THAT THE WINDS HAVE
NOT INCREASED AND THE PRESSURE IS NOT DROPPING YET.  THIS SHOWS ONCE
AGAIN...THE UNCERTAINTIES NOT ONLY IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST BUT
ALSO IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE INITIAL INTENSITY.  NEVERTHELESS...WITH
BOTH GFDL AND SHIPS MODELS SUGGESTING STRENGTHENING AND SUCH A GOOD
PATTERN ON SATELLITE PICTURES...INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST.
 
THE STEERING PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED AND MODELS... IN GENERAL...ARE 
CONSISTENTLY TURNING DENNIS NORTHWEST AND NORTHWARD ON A TRACK
PARALLEL AND NOT FAR FROM THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA.  HOWEVER...ONLY
A SMALL DEVIATION TO THE LEFT OF THE TRACK COULD RESULT IN AN
INCREASE OF THE WINDS NEAR THE COAST.  THEREFORE...WATCHES AND
WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.  AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...THE 72-HOUR FORECAST BRINGS DENNIS VERY CLOSE TO THE
SOUTH CAROLINA COAST.  AT THAT TIME...THE TROUGH MAY BE GONE AND
BECOME REPLACED BY A HIGH. THIS COULD RESULT IN A VERY SLOW MOVING
HURRICANE WHICH COULD WAIT FOR THE NEXT TROUGH TO  MOVE THE
HURRICANE OUT TO SEA OR REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY NEAR THE COASTS OF
NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA.

DENNIS HAS CONTINUED TO GRADUALLY BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED THIS
EVENING. RADAR IMAGES RELAYED FROM THE NOAA P-3 RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT NOW SHOW A FULLY FORMED EYE...35-40 MILES IN DIAMETER.
THE AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER REPORTS THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE
IS NOW 980 MB...A 12 MB DROP OVER THE LAST 24 HRS....ALTHOUGH THE
WINDS HAVE NOT YET RESPONDED. SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE
CENTER IS NOW EMBEDDED WITHIN VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS...-75C...WITH
THE DEEP CONVECTION WRAPPING AROUND THE CENTER. ALL THESE SIGNALS
SUGGEST THAT THE INTENSIFICATION PROCESS IS BEGINNING. WE WILL
HOLD THE INITIAL INTENSITY AT 70 KTS FOR THIS ADVISORY UNTIL HIGHER
WINDS ARE CONFIRMED BY RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT. THE INTENSITY
FORECAST IS UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WHICH BRINGS
DENNIS TO A CATEGORY THREE HURRICANE BY 48 HRS.
 
AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE FIXES THIS EVENING INDICATE THAT THE CENTER
HAS BEEN DRIFTING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD DURING THE LAST 3-6 HRS. THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE...300/06 KT...IS BASED ON A 12-24 HR MEAN.
DENNIS REMAINS IN A LIGHT STEERING ENVIRONMENT.  THE DATA FROM THE
NOAA G-IV SYNOPTIC FLOW MISSION AROUND THE HURRICANE SHOWS A 500MB
RIDGE ALONG 31N/32N FROM BERMUDA TO NEAR 78W. THIS FEATURE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO STEER DENNIS ON A SLOW WEST-NORTH TO NORTHWEST COURSE
FOR THE NEXT DAY OR SO. THEREAFTER...THINGS BECOME A BIT MORE
UNCERTAIN AS THE IMPACT OF A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW...SEEN IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI...CUTS OFF OVER THE
GULF COASTAL REGION.  THE EXACT LOCATION OF THIS LOW WILL HELP
DETERMINE...IN PART...THE STEERING OF DENNIS NEAR THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD. THE 00Z TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO
THEIR 18Z COUNTERPARTS WITH BAMS AND BAMM THE WESTERN-MOST OF THE
TRACKS. MOST OF THE DYNAMICAL-BASED GUIDANCE TURNS DENNIS AWAY FROM
THE SOUTHEAST COAST BEYOND 48 HRS HOWEVER...WE WILL WAIT FOR THE 00Z
MODEL CYCLE...WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE G-IV DATA...BEFORE MAKING ANY
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK.  THE NHC TRACK
REPRESENTS AN UPDATE TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO THE WATCHES/WARNINGS HOWEVER...ALL
INTERESTS ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COASTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS HURRICANE.

CORRECTION TO INITIAL WIND SPEED...70 KNOTS NOT 75 KNOTS

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/05 BASED ON THE PAST 24 HOURS OF
MOTION.  THE 06Z MODEL GUIDANCE SHOULD BENEFIT FROM THE SYNOPTIC
SURVEILLANCE MISSION FROM WHICH DATA WAS USED TO INITIALIZE THE 00Z
AVIATION MODEL.  EVEN SO...THE 06Z MODELS HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH FROM
EARLIER GUIDANCE.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST ALSO DOES NOT CHANGE
MUCH EXCEPT AT 72 HOURS WHERE THE FORECAST POINT IS MOVED ABOUT 90
NMI FURTHER EAST.  THIS POINT IS NEAR THE GFDL FORECAST AND WEST OF
ALL THE OTHER MODELS EXCEPT THE BAM MODELS.
 
THE LATEST RECON PRESSURE IS 975 MB WHICH IS DOWN 13 MB IN 24 HOURS.
THE HIGHEST FLIGHT LEVEL WIND FROM THE RECON MISSION WAS 78 KNOTS AT
700 MB ABOUT 30 NMI NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  SO 70 KNOTS IS STILL A
GOOD SURFACE WIND SPEED FOR THIS ADVISORY.  WITH A CLOSED EYE AND
FALLING PRESSURE...IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE WINDS WILL INCREASE SOON
AS REFLECTED IN THE FORECAST TO 90 KNOTS IN 36 HOURS.  AFTER THAT
ONLY SLIGHT ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST...FOLLOWING THE

LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE SOMEWHAT ENCOURAGING.  UNANIMOUSLY...ALL
MODELS ARE GRADUALLY TURNING THE HURRICANE TO THE NORTH AND
NORTHEAST ON A TRACK PARALLEL AND CLOSE TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA AND
NORTH CAROLINA COASTS.  THE UK MODEL IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE BRINGING
THE HURRICANE OUT TO SEA...EMBEDDED IN THE FLOW AHEAD OF THE TROUGH.
THE GFDL IS THE MOST CONSERVATIVE...FORECASTING DENNIS OVER THE
SOUTH CAROLINA/NORTH CAROLINA BORDER BY 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST  HAS BEEN SHIFTED A LITTLE BIT TO THE RIGHT AND SLOWS DOWN
THE HURRICANE CONSIDERABLY BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS
IS BASED ON LONG RANGE MODELS...NOGAPS...MRF AND EMCWF WHICH
MAINTAIN THE HURRICANE MEANDERING OVER NORTH CAROLINA/VIRGINIA AND
ADJACENT WATERS...BEYOND 72 HOURS.
 
WITH THIS TRACK IN MIND...NO CHANGES IN WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE
NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.   HOWEVER...ANY DEVIATION TO THE LEFT OR AN
ACCELERATION WILL REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF WATCHES OR WARNINGS FOR A
PORTION OF SOUTHEAST COAST TONIGHT.

TO SHOW AN IMPROVEMENT IN ORGANIZATION.  HOWEVER...THE HURRICANE
STILL LACKS A WELL DEFINED INNER CORE.  OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST
BRINGS DENNIS TO 100 KNOTS...BASED PRIMARILY ON SHIPS MODEL AND THE

APPEARANCE. 18/22Z RADAR IMAGERY FROM THE NOAA P-3 AIRCRAFT SHOWED 
A BROAD ILL-DEFINED EYE FEATURE WHILE QUOTING THE AIR FORCE THEY
COULD NOT SEE IT ON RADAR AND IT WAS NOT DISCERNABLE VISUALLY.  
THE LATEST RECON REPORTS THAT THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE REMAINS
969 MB...A 11 MB DROP OVER THE LAST 24 HRS. THE INITIAL INTENSITY
ESTIMATE WILL BE HELD AT 90 KTS SUPPORTED BY THE MOST RECENT HRD
WIND ANALYSIS...ALTHOUGH SURFACE DROPSONDE WINDS ARE LOWER. THE
STRENGTHENING FORECAST IS MAINTAINED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
WHICH BRINGS DENNIS TO A CATEGORY THREE HURRICANE IN 24 HRS.

WITH SUCH A LARGE AND RAGGED EYE FEATURE...THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE AIR FORCE RECON FIXES AND THE LATEST RADAR FIX
ESTIMATES. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/06 KTS. MOST OF THE
OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THEIR 18Z COUNTERPARTS
INDICATING THAT THE NEXT EAST COAST MID- TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL
PICK UP DENNIS AND ACCELERATE IT NORTHEAST JUST OFFSHORE WHILE THE
GFDL BRINGS DENNIS NORTH-NORTHWEST/NORTHWARD INTO NORTH CAROLINA BY
72 HRS...SUGGESTING THAT THE TROUGH BY-PASSES THE HURRICANE. THIS
SHOWS THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE MODELS WITH SOME MOVING THE DENNIS OUT
TO OPEN WATERS WHILE OTHER HINT KEEPING DENNIS NEAR THE COAST FOR A
PROLONGED PERIOD. WITH THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE
INFLUENCE OF THE APPROACHING TROUGH...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
BRINGS DENNIS NORTH-NORTHWEST THEN NORTH TO JUST OFF THE NORTH
CAROLINA COAST BY 48 HRS BEFORE TURNING THE HURRICANE NORTHEAST...
ALBEIT AT A SLOWER MOTION THAN MOST OF THE GUIDANCE. 

BASED ON THE NEW TRACK... HURRICANE WATCHES WILL BE POSTED FOR THE
SOUTH CAROLINA AND PORTIONS OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COASTS.  A PORTION
OF THE WATCH AREA WILL LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM OR
HURRICANE WARNING SUNDAY MORNING.  DENNIS IS A LARGE HURRICANE WITH
THE 34-KT RADII EXTENDING 140 NM IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT AND COULD
IMPACT A LARGE PORTION OF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. ...ALL INTERESTS
ALONG THE COASTS OF GEORGIA...SOUTH AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD

THE INITIL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 335/07.  ALL OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS
SHOW THE HURRICANE MOVING NORTH AND THEN NORTHEASTWARD AS A STRONG
TROUGH DROPS SOUTH FROM CANADA.  MOST OF THE MODELS SHOW AN
ACCELERATION TOWARD THE NORTHEAST BUT THE GFDL SUGGESTS THAT DENNIS
MAY NOT GET PICKED UP BY THE TROUGH AND COULD MEANDER OFF THE MID
ATLANTIC COAST.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST BUT NOT ALL THE WAY TO THE NEAREST DYNAMIC
MODELS.  THIS BIAS TO THE LEFT OF THE GUIDANCE IS A RESULT OF NOT
WANTING TO DEPART FROM THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST TOO
DRASTICALLY.

THE FORECAST TRACK IN COMBINATION WITH THE LARGE RADIUS OF 34-KNOT
WINDS REQUIRES THAT A TROPICAL STORM WARNING BE ISSUED FOR SOUTH
CAROLINA AND PART OF NORTH CAROLINA.  THERE IS PROBABLY ONLY A 50
PERCENT OR LESS CHANCE THAT TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS WILL ACTUALLY
OCCUR IN THE WARNING AREA...BUT THERE IS ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY TO
JUSTIFY THESE WARNINGS.

BASED ON RECON WIND OBSERVATIONS...THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED TO 85
KNOTS WITH AN EXPECTATION OF SOME SLOW STRENGTHENING FOR THE NEXT
DAY OR TWO.  THIS IS BASED ON THE SHIPS MODEL GUIDANCE.

DENNIS IS NOW MOVING NORTHWARD NEAR 9 KNOTS...NEAR THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  A LARGE 500 MB TROUGH MOVING
OFF THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. COAST IN 24 HOURS IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A
SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING CURRENT THAT SHOULD CAUSE DENNIS TO
GRADUALLY TURN TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHEAST AND THEN NORTHEAST...
AWAY FROM THE COAST.  THIS IS ALSO INDICATED BY NEARLY ALL OF THE
OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE. THE CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...ALBEIT SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT.

THERE IS STILL SOME CONCERN THAT THE TROUGH WILL PULL OUT LATE IN
THE PERIOD...AND LEAVE DENNIS BEHIND.  THE CURRENT THINKING IS
THAT...IF THIS OCCURS...THE HURRICANE WILL BE WELL EAST OF THE COAST
BY THAT TIME.
 
ON SATELLITE IMAGES...DENNIS HAS BECOME A LITTLE BETTER-ORGANIZED

INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS ADJUSTED TO 90 KNOTS.  AN UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE
SITUATED ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO THE WEST OF DENNIS SHOULD ASSIST THE
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW AND SINCE THE OCEAN TEMPERATURES ARE QUITE
WARM...LARGE-SCALE FACTORS FAVOR STRENGTHENING.  HOWEVER...THE
LACK OF A WELL-DEFINED INNER CORE STRUCTURE IS A NEGATIVE FACTOR. 
THEREFORE ONLY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN INTENSITY IS PREDICTED AT THIS

LATEST FIXES SUGGEST A SLIGHT EASTWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION...WHICH
HAS BEEN ANTICIPATED IN THE FORECASTS.  THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD
OF 500 MB TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. IS EXPECTED TO TURN
DENNIS TOWARD THE NORTHEAST IN 12 TO 24 HOURS.  SOME INCREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED IS LIKELY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THEREAFTER...THE FORECAST IS COMPLICATED BY THE POSSIBILITY
THAT THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL LIFT NORTHEASTWARD AND LEAVE DENNIS
BEHIND.  THUS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SLOWS THE FORWARD SPEED MARKEDLY
IN 48 TO 72 HOURS...BUT THE CENTER SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY FAR FROM
THE COAST BY THAT TIME.  NONETHELESS A BLOCKING HIGH...WHICH SHOULD
REPLACE THE NORTHEAST U.S. TROUGH...MAY CAUSE DENNIS TO MEANDER OFF
THE COAST NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD AND BEYOND.

THERE WAS ONLY A SLIGHT PRESSURE DROP REPORTED BY THE HURRICANE
HUNTERS THIS AFTERNOON...SO CURRENT INTENSITY IS MAINTAINED.  THE
INNER CORE STRUCTURE IS STILL NOT WELL DEFINED.  DENNIS HAS A
LARGE... RAGGED BANDING-TYPE EYE 45 TO 50 N MI ACROSS.  SUCH
TROPICAL CYCLONES TYPICALLY DO NOT STRENGTHEN RAPIDLY.  ON THE OTHER
HAND THE WATERS ARE WARM AND THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW LOOKS
FAVORABLE.   MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS COULD STILL BE ATTAINED WITHIN
24 HOURS OR SO.
 
ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE FORECAST
TRACK...THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND ITS NEARNESS TO THE COAST
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS HAS PROMPTED THE ISSUANCE OF HURRICANE
WARNINGS.

SUGGESTS THAT THE TROUGH WILL BY-PASS THE HURRICANE LEAVING DENNIS
JUST OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST BY 72 HRS. THEREAFTER...THERE IS
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE FUTURE TRACK OF DENNIS.
BLOCKING HIGH...WHICH SHOULD REPLACE THE NORTHEAST U.S. TROUGH...
MAY CAUSE THE CYCLONE TO MEANDER OFF THE COAST NEAR THE END OF THE

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 025/10.  THE AVIATION MODEL...GFDL
...UKMET...AND NOGAPS...ALL SHOW THE HURRICANE NOT GETTING PICKED UP
BY THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER THE NORTHEAST U.S. 
SO THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST MOVES THE HURRICANE NORTHEAST TO
EAST-NORTHEASTWARD FOR 36 HOURS WITH NO MOVEMENT FROM 36 THROUGH 72
HOURS.  THE GFDL MODEL TURNS THE HURRICANE BACK TOWARD THE WEST AND
THREATENS THE CHESAPEAKE BAY AREA WHILE THE OTHER MODELS TEND STAY A
FEW HUNDRED MILES EAST OF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST.  IT IS OF COURSE
NOT POSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHICH WAY THE HURRICANE WILL MOVE
AFTER IT GETS LEFT BEHIND BY THE TROUGH.  THE FORECAST TRACK BRINGS
THE CENTER WITHIN ABOUT 35 NMI OF THE OUTER BANKS OF N CAROLINA IN
12 HOURS SO THE HURRICANE WARNING IS EXTENDED A LITTLE NORTHWARD TO
THE NORTH CAROLINA/VIRGINIA BORDER.  

THE LATEST RECON PRESSURE IS 963 MB.  RECON DATA SHOWS THAT THE MAX
WIND SPEED IS 85 KNOTS INSTEAD OF 90.  THERE IS STILL A CHANCE OF
SOME INTENSIFICATION AS RADAR SHOWS THAT THE EYE APPEARS TO BE
GETTING BETTER ORGANIZED.

THE MOTION THIS MORNING HAS BEEN FASTER TO THE EAST-NORTHEAST...A
POSITIVE SIGN...BUT ALL GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT THIS A SHORT TERM
ACCELERATION.  A HOPEFULLY REPRESENTATIVE INITIAL MOTION IS 060/13. 
ALTHOUGH THE GFDL INDICATES A SHARP TURN NORTHWESTWARD BACK TOWARDS
THE COAST...THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE MOVES DENNIS SLOWLY AWAY FROM
THE U.S.  THE AVN BEYOND 48 H SHOWS DENNIS EMBEDDED WITHIN A
DOUGHNUT-SHAPED RIDGE...AS THE LONG-WAVE PATTERN UNDERGOES A MAJOR
SHIFT.  IF THIS VERIFIES...DENNIS WILL MOVE LITTLE...AND THIS IS THE
OPTION FAVORED BY THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE MOST RECENT PRESSURE FROM THE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT IS 965
MB...UP FROM THE PREVIOUS FIX.  THE FIRST SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS SUGGESTS THAT DENNIS HAS PEAKED AND WILL SLOWLY
WEAKEN OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS IN A HIGH SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  THE

AS EXPECTED...THE MOTION OF DENNIS IS STARTING TO SLOW DOWN A
BIT...FROM 18 TO 15 KNOTS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THE EARLIER
ACCELERATION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RELATED TO A MID-UPPER LEVEL
VORTICITY MAXIMUM DIGGING SOUTH TO THE WEST OF THE CYCLONE.  TRACK
GUIDANCE IS SPLIT AGAIN...EVEN MORE SO THAN EARLIER...WITH THE GFDL
INSISTING ON A HARD LEFT TURN AND LANDFALL IN NORTHERN NORTH
CAROLINA WITHIN 36 HOURS.  THIS IS THE REASON THAT MOST OF THE
WARNINGS WILL REMAIN UP WITH THIS PACKAGE.  THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE
TAKES THE SYSTEM WELL OFFSHORE BEFORE SLOWING IT DOWN.  GIVEN THE
MOTION THIS AFTERNOON...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED RIGHT OF
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BY ABOUT 60 MILES...AND IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN THE HIGHLY DIVERGENT BAMD/LBAR AND GFDL.  THE AVN BEYOND 48

LONG-WAVE PATTERN UNDERGOES A MAJOR SHIFT.  IF THIS VERIFIES...
DENNIS WILL MOVE LITTLE...AND THIS IS STILL THE OPTION FAVORED BY

THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS BEEN IN THE UPPER 960S ALL DAY.  AIR FORCE
RESERVE UNIT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT FOUND 98 KNOTS IN THE SOUTHEAST
QUADRANT AT FLIGHT LEVEL.  DROPSONDE DATA OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS
SHOW THAT DENNIS HAS NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE AT BRINGING
HIGH WINDS DOWN TO THE SURFACE...AND THE INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS
LOWERED TO 80 KT.  NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED

AFTER ACCERATING TO 17 KNOTS FORWARD MOTION ON MONDAY...DENNIS HAS
SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW
065/06.  ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT SEEN THE 00Z AVIATION RUN...THE UKMET
AND NOGAPS 00Z RUNS BOTH SHOW LITTLE MOTION FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS
WHILE CUT OFF FROM ANY SIGNIFICANT STEERING CURRENTS.  BOTH MODELS
FORECAST A TIGHT CYCLONIC LOOP AND END UP A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE
STARTING POSITION.  THE 18Z GFDL MODEL SHOWED A WESTWARD MOTION
MOVING DENNIS BACK ACROSS THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST AFTER 48 HOURS. 
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE ABOVE...ENDING UP
ABOUT 30 NMI WEST OF THE INITIAL POSITION IN 72 HOURS.  WITH THIS
FORECAST...THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE COASTAL WARNINGS EXCEPT THAT 
THE GALE WARNINGS HAVE BEEN EXTENDED A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH INTO NEW

RECON DATA INDICATES THE WINDS HAVE WEAKENED TO 75 KNOTS AS THE
CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE HAS RISEN TO 977 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGERY
SHOWS ONLY A LITTLE DEEP CONVECTION AND THIS HAS BEEN SHEARED WELL
TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  ALSO THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE MOTION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. BECAUSE OF
A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE LONGWAVE PATTERN...THE MID-LATITUDE WESTERLIES
ARE SHIFTING WELL TO THE NORTH.  AT MID-LEVELS...DENNIS IS BECOMING
SANDWICHED BETWEEN HIGH PRESSURE AREAS.  THEREFORE...THE MOTION IS
LIKELY TO BE SLOW AND ERRATIC.  THIS IS SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.  HOWEVER IF THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH BECOMES MORE
DOMINANT...THAN A MORE WESTWARD TRACK COULD DEVELOP.  NO CHANGES
HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS SINCE DENNIS IS NO
LONGER MOVING AWAY FROM THE COAST.
 
COOL DRY AIR HAS INVADED THE CIRCULATION OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE SO
THAT THERE IS NOW LITTLE...IF ANY DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH
THE SYSTEM.  DENNIS DOES NOT LOOK VERY TROPICAL AT THIS TIME.
OBSERVATIONS INDICATE A VERY LARGE RADIUS OF MAXIMUM WINDS AND ONLY
A SLIGHT TEMPERATURE RISE AT THE CENTER.  SINCE THE SYSTEM IS NOT
FAR FROM WARM WATERS AND THE AIR MASS COULD RECOVER...THERE IS A
SLIGHT CHANCE THAT DENNIS COULD MAKE A COMEBACK.  OTHERWISE THE

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS...THERE HAS BEEN A NET WESTWARD MOTION
OF THE CENTER AT 4 OR 5 KNOTS.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS NOT AN EASY
ONE.  IF ENOUGH RIDGING DEVELOPS TO THE NORTH OF DENNIS...THEN THE
CYCLONE COULD MOVE TO THE COAST.  HOWEVER RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHEAST
U.S. AND FLORIDA COULD BLOCK THE FORWARD MOVEMENT.  EVEN THOUGH THE
TRACK MODELS ARE DIVERGENT...A ROUGH CONSENSUS OF THE MORE RELIABLE
MODELS SUGGESTS A WEST TO SOUTHWEST MOTION DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS IDEA...BUT QUITE SLOW
MAINLY DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY.
 
SINCE THE MOTION AND FORECAST IS BACK TOWARD THE COAST...A HURRICANE
WATCH IS PUT INTO EFFECT ACROSS THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING AREA.
ANOTHER BIG QUESTION IS THE INTENSITY.  DENNIS WEAKENED BECAUSE OF
THE INTRUSION OF COOL DRY AIR INTO ITS CENTRAL CORE...AND LIKELY
ALSO BECAUSE OF STRONG HIGH-LEVEL WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS.  SINCE
THE MID-LATITUDE WESTERLIES HAVE SHIFTED NORTH OF THE EASTERN U.S.
NO NEW COLD FRONTS ARE EXPECTED TO ENTER INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OF
DENNIS DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  OCEAN TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 27 DEG
C.  TROPICAL CYCLONES RARELY COME BACK AFTER ALL DEEP CONVECTION HAS
BEEN REMOVED.  THERE WAS A TRANSIENT RE-DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION
NEAR THE CENTER...BUT THIS HAS FADED.  BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF SKILL
IN FORECASTING INTENSITY CHANGE...AND THE POSSIBILITY...ALBEIT
SLIM... THAT DENNIS COULD RE-STRENGTHEN...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
MERELY MAINTAINS 65 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

...CORRECTED HURRICANE TO TROPICAL STORM...

DENNIS CURRENTLY AS MUCH RESEMBLES AN EXTRATROPICAL LOW AS A
TROPICAL CYCLONE...WITH LITTLE SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER AND A LARGE RADIUS OF MAXIMUM WIND. THE LATEST REPORTS FROM
AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER INDICATE A 987 MB CENTRAL
PRESSURE AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 71 KT...DOWN 15 KT FROM
EARLIER TODAY. DENNIS IS THEREFORE DOWNGRADED TO A 60 KT TROPICAL
STORM.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/03. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORECAST
PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND THE
LARGE SCALE MODELS INDICATE A DEVELOPING RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL AND
EASTERN U.S....WHICH WOULD FAVOR DENNIS MOVING ON A WEST TO
SOUTHWEST TRACK. HOWEVER...EXISTING RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN
U.S. COULD EITHER SLOW THIS MOTION OR DEFLECT DENNIS TO THE SOUTH.
NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE IS SCATTERED BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF
BAMS...OVER KENTUCKY IN 72 HOURS...AND A98E...SHOWING A SOUTHWARD
MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS. ONE POTENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THE AVN-BASED
GUIDANCE IS THAT THE MODEL DEVELOPS A SPURIOUS LOOKING VORTEX EAST
OF DENNIS OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THIS MAY PRODUCE A MORE SOUTHWARD
MOTION IN THE GUIDANCE THAN WOULD ACTUALLY OCCUR. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS GENERALLY DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE...AND A LITTLE
TO THE WEST OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN. THE AVN AND NOGAPS
MODELS HAVE A POOR HANDLE ON AN EAST-WEST UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER
DENNIS...WHICH IS CAUSING DIFLUENCE OVER THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
CIRCULATION AND SUBSIDENCE OVER THE SOUTHERN PART. BOTH MODELS
FORECAST STRONG SHEAR OVER DENNIS...WHICH IS SUSPECT DUE TO THE POOR
INITIALIZATION. HOWEVER...WITH THE CURRENT LACK OF CONVECTION AND A
TROUGH OVER THE SYSTEM INSTEAD OF A RIDGE...A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS
FORECAST THROUGH 36 HOURS. AFTER THAT TIME...WARMER SSTS MAY HELP
HOLD THE INTENSITY UP.

ALTHOUGH THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR WEAKENING...ANY SHORT TERM
INCREASE IN THE CONVECTION COULD BRING THE SYSTEM BACK TO HURRICANE
STRENGTH. THEREFORE...THE HURRICANE WATCH WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT
UNTIL A DEFINITIVE WEAKENING TREND IS ESTABLISHED.

11 AM EDT WED SEP 01 1999

THE CYCLONE HAS BEEN GRADUALLY FILLING AND THE CIRCULATION IS
SPINNING DOWN SLOWLY.  LATEST ESTIMATE OF MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS IS
50 KNOTS...BASED ON 80 PER CENT OF FLIGHT LEVEL WIND SPEEDS.  

AS WAS STATED EARLIER...DENNIS DOES NOT LOOK VERY TROPICAL.  COOL
DRY AIR CONTINUES TO BE ENTRAINED INTO THE CIRCULATION. OVERALL THE
SYSTEM HAS THE APPEARANCE OF AN OCCLUDED LOW.  STRONGEST WINDS ARE
NOT CLOSE TO THE CENTER.  IT IS ONLY THE SPORADIC REDEVELOPMENT OF
HEAVY SHOWERS NEAR THE CENTER THAT GIVES A HINT OF TROPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS.  BUT...SINCE DEEP CONVECTION IS MINIMAL...THE
SYSTEM BARELY MEETS DVORAK CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA.

STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW CONTINUES TO SHEAR ANY
CONVECTION THAT TRIES TO FORM NEAR THE CENTER...AND PROHIBITS
REDEVELOPMENT.  SINCE DENNIS HAS ALREADY LOST MOST OF ITS TROPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS...AND REGENERATION AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE SEEMS
UNLIKELY...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS DENNIS BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL
IN 12 HOURS.  

STEERING CURRENTS CONTINUE TO BE ALMOST NIL.  A SLOW WESTWARD TO
SOUTHWESTWARD MOTION IS FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THIS
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF A MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO
THE NORTHWEST OF THE CYCLONE....AND IS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE
GLOBAL MODELS.

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHANGES SINCE EARLIER TODAY.  LAST RECON
INDICATED A BAND OF CONVECTION FEEDING INTO THE CENTER...AND WSR-
88D SHOWS THIS AS WELL.  SATELLITE IMAGERY ALSO SHOWS MORE
PERSISTENT CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  SO THE TREND TOWARD
EXTRATROPICAL STATUS HAS APPARENTLY CEASED.  THE CYCLONE MAY BE
UNDERGOING SOME SORT OF SUBTROPICAL EVOLUTION...WHEREIN THE CENTRAL
CORE IS EMBEDDED WITHIN A LARGER UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC
CIRCULATION...IN AN AREA WHERE THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS LESSENED.  IN
FACT...THE SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THE SHEAR OVER THE CENTER
MAY BE WEAKENING.  CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS 50 KNOTS AND NO
CHANGE IS PREDICTED THROUGH THE PERIOD...DUE TO OUR LACK OF
UNDERSTANDING THE FUTURE EVOLUTION OF DENNIS.    

A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION HAS BEEN OBSERVED RECENTLY...AROUND 270/3. 
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE PREVIOUS
ONE.   ALTHOUGH THE STEERING CURRENTS ARE NOT VERY WELL
DEFINED...THE PRIMARY PLAYERS APPEAR TO BE A MID-LEVEL RIDGE OVER
THE EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN U.S. AND A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE
THAT ENVELOPS DENNIS.   THESE FEATURES ARE EXPECTED TO CAUSE A
GRADUAL BEND OF THE TRACK TOWARD THE WEST-SOUTHWEST...AND THEN
SOUTHWEST.  THIS IS ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACKS.

A CONVECTIVE BAND FLARED UP WEST OF THE CENTER OF DENNIS DURING
THE EVENING AND THEN WRAPPED AROUND THE SOUTH SIDE. THIS PULLED THE
CENTER A LITTLE EASTWARD. THE BAND HAS SINCE WEAKENED...WITH RADAR
AND SATELLITE CURRENTLY INDICATING LITTLE CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER. BASED ON THIS...AND PERIPHERAL OBSERVATIONS...THE MAXIMUM
SUSTAINED WINDS REMAIN AT 50 KT.

GIVE THIS EASTWARD WOBBLE...THE INITIAL MOTION FOR THIS PACKAGE IS
STATIONARY. MODEL GUIDANCE HAS SOMEWHAT CLUSTERED INTO TWO
POSSIBILITIES. THE FIRST...SUPPORTED BY THE BAMS...BAMM...AND
NHC98UK...IS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION INTO NORTH CAROLINA IN
RESPONSE TO THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE NEAR DENNIS SHIFTING TO THE EAST.
THE SECOND...SUPPORTED BY THE AVN...NOGAPS...AND GFDL...IS FOR A
MORE SOUTHWESTWARD MOTION IN RESPONSE TO A BUILDING MID LEVEL RIDGE
OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN U.S.. EXAMINATION OF SURFACE ANALYSES
AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES BOTH OF THESE RIDGES MAY BE
DEVELOPING AS FORECAST. THUS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES AND AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. 

THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST THAT IT
IS HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. FIRST...AS MENTIONED EARLIER...
DENNIS MAY BE GOING THROUGH A SUBTROPICAL PHASE. THIS WOULD DELAY
STRENGTHENING THROUGH TROPICAL CYCLONE PROCESSES. SECOND...VERTICAL
SHEAR HAS DECREASED SINCE YESTERDAY...WITH SOME INDICATIONS OF
ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW. HOWEVER...WESTERLY SHEAR...WELL FORECAST BY
THE MODELS...INCREASES TO THE SOUTHWEST ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK.
THIRD...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH...POORLY INITIALIZED IN THE MODELS...
IS SEEN IN WATER VAPOR APPROACHING DENNIS FROM THE WEST. THIS MIGHT
EITHER INCREASE CONVECTION OR INCREASE SHEAR. FOURTH...DENNIS HAS
BEEN ESSENTIALLY STATIONARY FOR 36 TO 48 HOURS...AND HAS LIKELY
COOLED OFF THE OCEAN UNDERNEATH IT. THIS WOULD HAMPER
INTENSIFICATION...ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT WARMER SSTS ARE PRESENT TO THE
SOUTHWEST ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK...ESPECIALLY OVER THE GULF
STREAM. GIVEN ALL THESE UNCERTAINTIES...THE INTENSITY FORECAST HOLDS
DENNIS AT ITS CURRENT STRENGTH THROUGH 72 HOURS.

THERE IS NOTHING NEW TO SAY ABOUT DENNIS.  LETS FACE IT...DENNIS
CONTINUES TO LOOK LIKE AN EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE WITH A INTERMITTENT
PATCHES OF CONVECTION.  A SIMPLE INSPECTION OF THE FULL DISK GOES-8
SHOWS THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN OF DENNIS IS SIMILAR TO THE
EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE LOCATED ABOUT 1600 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST. 
BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL STRENGTHEN DENNIS AND IN GENERAL...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST WOULD GO ALONG WITH THESE MODELS.  IN THIS CASE
...REGENERATION IS NOT REALISTIC SINCE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE
FORECAST TO REMAIN UNFAVORABLE. 

THE WEST TO WEST-SOUTHWEST TRACK FORECAST BY MODELS AS WELL AS THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET.  DENNIS REMAINS NEARLY
STATIONARY

I HAVE THE SAME DILEMMA THAT I HAD YESTERDAY.  I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE
A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE FORECAST OR THE STATUS WITHOUT VISIBLE
IMAGES OR RECON.   THIS FORECAST IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE...KEEPING DENNIS NEARLY STATIONARY FOR 12 HOURS OR SO
AND THEN...MOVING IT TOWARD THE WEST-SOUTHWEST.  THE STATUS OF THE
TROPICAL STORM WARNING WILL PROBABLY BE RECONSIDERED LATER DAY.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW A WELL-ORGANIZED SYSTEM...WITH DENSER
CLOUDS NEAR AND OVER THE CENTER.  HOWEVER THE CLOUD TOPS ARE NOT
VERY HIGH AND RADAR OBSERVATIONS DO NOT SHOW A CLEARLY-DEFINED
CENTER.  THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH SINCE YESTERDAY.
TYPICALLY FOR A CYCLONE THAT REMAINS STALLED FOR THIS LENGTH OF
TIME...THE OCEAN IS COOLED SUBSTANTIALLY BY THE SURFACE WIND
CIRCULATION.  HOWEVER IN THIS INSTANCE THE CENTER HAS REMAINED OVER
THE GULF STREAM...A VAST OCEANIC HEAT SOURCE.   SO THERE IS CONSTANT
REPLENISHMENT OF WARM WATER INTO THE AREA.  THE SHIPS AND GFDL MODEL
PREDICT STRENGTHENING TO A HURRICANE LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
BECAUSE OF THE USUAL UNCERTAINTY IN PREDICTING INTENSITY CHANGE...
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OVERALL MOTION SINCE YESTERDAY.  OBJECTIVE
TRACK GUIDANCE INSISTS ON A MOVEMENT TOWARD THE COAST.  THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE 2-3 DAY FORECAST OF A MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER
THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. SHOWN BY THE AVN MODEL.  HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO
AN ANTICYCLONE SHOWN OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO AROUND THAT TIME.  THIS
COULD NEGATE THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK
FORECAST IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ONE...MOVING THE SYSTEM
VERY SLOWLY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE PERIOD AND THEN TOWARD THE
WEST-SOUTHWEST LATER ON.

AN OBSERVATION FROM A VESSEL WITH CALL SIGN ELFV3 SHOWED WEST-
NORTHWEST WINDS OF 45 KNOTS ABOUT 50 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER.
SINCE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THIS IS THE HIGHEST WIND SPEED IN
THE CIRCULATION...THE ESTIMATE OF 50 KNOTS FOR THE CURRENT INTENSITY
LOOKS REASONABLE.
 
THE STORM CONTINUES TO APPEAR WELL ORGANIZED ON VISIBLE SATELLITE
IMAGES...BUT OVERALL THE CONVECTION REMAINS QUITE SHALLOW.  WSR-88D
OBSERVATIONS SHOWED THE CENTER BECOMING A LITTLE BETTER-DEFINED THIS
AFTERNOON.  THE SHIPS MODEL FORECASTS 65 KNOTS BY 48 HOURS...BUT
THIS IS A STATISTICAL MODEL BASED MAINLY ON DATA FROM TYPICAL
TROPICAL CYCLONES.  DENNIS...AT THIS STAGE...IS FAIRLY ATYPICAL WITH
SOME SUBTROPICAL-TYPE CHARACTERISTICS.  MOREOVER THE SHIPS OUTPUT
INDICATES DECREASING VERTICAL SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM...AND THIS MAY
NOT VERIFY.  GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES...NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS
FORECAST.
 
THE CENTER HAS MOVED GENERALLY SOUTHWESTWARD OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS.  WHETHER THIS IS ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF MEANDERS/WOBBLES...
OR A DEFINITIVE MOTION THAT WILL PERSIST...ONLY TIME WILL TELL. THE
STEERING ENVIRONMENT DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD IS CHARACTERIZED BY
MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGES TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST OF
DENNIS...AND THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ITSELF APPEARS TO BE EMBEDDED
WITHIN A LARGER-SCALE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION.  THIS IS A COMPLEX
STEERING PATTERN AND THE OBJECTIVE TRACKS...ALTHOUGH FAIRLY
DIVERSE...ROUGHLY SHOW A SOUTHWEST...THEN WEST...AND THEN NORTHWEST
TRACK DURING THE PERIOD.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST MOVES
DENNIS IN A SIMILAR FASHION...BUT VERY SLOWLY.

BEAR IN MIND THAT THE 48 TO 72 HOURS FORECAST POINTS
ARE...HISTORICALLY... SUBJECT TO LARGE ERRORS.

...CORRECTION 2ND SENTENCE...SOUTHWARD TO SOUTH-SOUTHWESTWARD...

SATELLITE AND RADAR FIXES INDICATE THAT DENNIS HAS BEEN MOVING
SOUTH-SOUTHWESTWARD OVER THE LAST 3-6 HRS. THE MOST RECENT SSM/I
DATA SUPPORTS THIS...AND THE INITIAL POSITION ESTIMATE NOW IS
210/04.  AN EXTENDED PERIOD SATELLITE LOOP SHOWS THAT DENNIS HAS
BEEN DRIFTING GENERALLY SOUTHWARD FOR THE LAST DAY OR SO. WHILE THE
STEERING PATTERN REMAINS COMPLEX...WITH MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGES TO
THE NORTH-NORTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST OF DENNIS...A GENERAL CONSENSUS
OF THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE MODELS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A SOUTHWEST
...THEN WEST...THEN NORTHWEST TRACK DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
THIS SCENARIO IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...AT A SLOW
PACE....AND REPRESENTS A SLIGHT SOUTHWARD ADJUSTMENT TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY TRACK PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INITIAL MOTION. AS STATED IN 
THE LAST ADVISORY...ITS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE 48 TO 72
HOURS FORECAST POINTS ARE...HISTORICALLY...SUBJECT TO LARGE ERRORS.

THE STORM REMAINS RATHER WELL ORGANIZED IN SATELLITE IMAGERY
ALTHOUGH DEEP CONVECTION...TOPS TO -45C MAINLY EAST OF THE CENTER
...REMAINS LIMITED. DENNIS CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT SOME SUBTROPICAL
-TYPE CHARACTERISTICS....AS NOTED BY THE TAFB SATELLITE
METEOROLOGIST...AND APPEARS TO BE EMBEDDED WITHIN A LARGER-SCALE
CYCLONIC CIRCULATION.  MOREOVER...THE SHIPS OUTPUT CONTINUES TO
INDICATE DECREASING VERTICAL SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE...AND THIS MAY
NOT VERIFY.  GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES...NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS
FORECAST.

DENNIS LOOKS BETTER ORGANIZED THIS MORNING. ALTHOUGH CONVECTIVE TOPS
ARE RELATIVELY LOW...BANDING HAS INCREASED AROUND THE CENTER IN
BOTH SATELLITE IMAGERY AND WSR-88D DATA FROM MOREHEAD CITY.
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 45 KT AND 35 KT
RESPECTIVELY. THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS WILL REMAIN AT 50 KT FOR
THIS ADVISORY. AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER WILL ARRIVE IN
DENNIS AROUND 18Z TO UPDATE THE CURRENT INTENSITY AND WIND RADII.

DENNIS HAS MOVED 180/05 FOR THE PAST 12 HOURS. HOWEVER...RECENT
SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY SUGGESTS A SLOWER MOTION...SO 180/03
WILL BE USED IN THIS PACKAGE. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THE
STORM IS EMBEDDED IN A LARGE SCALE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION...WITH
MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WEST OF THE STORM OVER THE EASTERN U.S..
LARGE SCALE MODELS AGREE THAT THE RIDGE WILL WEAKEN AFTER 24 HOURS
AS A LARGE TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN U.S. MOVES EASTWARD. THE GUIDANCE
RESPONDS TO THESE CHANGES IN THE FLOW BY TURNING DENNIS TO EITHER A
NORTHWEST OR NORTHERLY TRACK DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE
NORTHWEST OPTION IS SUPPORTED BY THE GFDL...NOGAPS...UKMET...
ECMWF...AND ETA MODELS...WHILE THE NORTH OPTION IS SUPPORTED BY THE
AVN...NHC98UK...AND THE BAM MODELS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK GOES
WITH THE NORTHWEST OPTION...ALTHOUGH IT IS SHIFTED SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE EARLY IN THE FORECAST AND NORTH OF IT LATER. THE
CURRENT FORECAST CALLS FOR LANDFALL IN 48 TO 60 HOURS.
 
WHILE THE OVERALL UPPER LEVEL ENVIRONMENT AROUND DENNIS IS
CYCLONIC...AN SMALL ANTICYCLONE IS FORMING OVER THE CENTER. LARGE
SCALE MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT STRONG WESTERLIES JUST SOUTHWEST
OF THE CYCLONE SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD
AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PRECEDING THE LARGE WESTERN U.S. TROUGH
APPROACHES. THIS COULD CREATE A MORE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR
INTENSIFICATION. A LIMITING FACTOR...HOWEVER...IS SSTS. SHIP AND
BUOY DATA INDICATE THAT TEMPERATURES ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK ARE
26C OUTSIDE THE GULF STREAM..COMPARED TO 28C-29C A FEW DAYS AGO.
THIS MAY SLOW INTENSIFICATION. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR
LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH UNTIL 48 HOURS...WHEN DENNIS WILL BE
PASSING OVER THE GULF STREAM.

CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH DENNIS IS LESS WELL DEFINED THAN
EARLIER...WITH RAGGED BANDS PRIMARILY IN THE NORTHEASTERN
SEMICIRCLE. HOWEVER...AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER RECENTLY
REPORTED A 985 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE WITH 59 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS
NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER. THUS...THE CURRENT INTENSITY REMAINS AT 50
KT.

OF GREATER CONCERN NOW IS THE MOTION. AFTER A WOBBLE EASTWARD THIS
MORNING...THE LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY AND RECON FIXES SUGGEST A
NORTHWEST MOTION. IF THIS IS THE START OF THE EXPECTED TURN...IT IS
HAPPENING 12 TO 24 HOURS EARLIER THAN MODEL GUIDANCE HAS FORECAST.
TO GUARD AGAINST THIS BEING YET ANOTHER WOBBLE...THE INITIAL MOTION
IS SET TO 300/2. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE SYNOPTIC SITUATION OR
THE FORECAST GUIDANCE FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AS THE MODELS
STILL AGREE ON WEAKENING OF THE EASTERN U.S. RIDGE THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD. HOWEVER...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED
NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK AS THE SYSTEM IS NO LONGER MOVING SOUTH.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT DESPITE THE SHIFT THE FORECAST TRACK IS TO
THE RIGHT OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE...PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST 36
HOURS.

THERE IS ALSO LITTLE CHANGE IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST PHILOSOPHY
FROM THIS MORNING. DENNIS IS STILL EMBEDDED IN A UPPER LEVEL
CYCLONIC ENVIRONMENT...WITH STRONG NORTHWESTERLY FLOW JUST SOUTHWEST
OF THE CYCLONE. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE
CAROLINAS SHOULD BUILD A RIDGE OVER DENNIS...WHICH WOULD BE A MORE
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT. THE MAIN LIMITATION IS THE SSTS...WHICH ARE
26C-27C OUTSIDE OF THE GULF STREAM. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR
SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION AS DENNIS PASSES OVER THE GULF STREAM...
FOLLOWED BY WEAKENING AFTER LANDFALL.

WITH THE CHANGES IN THE FORECAST TRACK...TROPICAL STORM WATCHES ARE
BEING ISSUED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING AREA.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/02.  THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS
THE RIDGE NORTH OF THE STORM WEAKENING AS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVES
TOR THE GREAT LAKES IN 72 HOURS.  THIS IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THE STORM
NORTHWESTWARD WITH SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED IN 24 TO 48 HOURS.

THE 18Z GFDL AND 12Z UKMET AND NOGAPS MODELS ALL SHOW THE TRACK
ACROSS THE OUTER BANKS OF NORTH CAROLINA IN 24 TO 36 HOURS AND THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST DOES LIKEWISE.  THE HPC FORECAST IS A LITTLE
SLOWER AND FURTHER TO THE RIGHT.  SO THE WATCHES AND WARNINGS SEEM
ABOUT RIGHT FOR NOW.

SATELLITE IMAGERY AND THE MOREHEAD CITY RADAR SHOW A SMALL AREA OF
DEEP CONVECTION ROTATING AROUND THE WEST SIDE OF THE CENTER.  AS THE
CENTER MOVES ACROSS THE GULF STREAM...THERE COULD BE SOME
INTENSIFICATION AS INDICATED BY THE SHIPS AND GFDL MODELS.  THE

MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST ABOUT 5 KNOTS.  THE HIGH PRESSURE WHICH WAS
BLOCKING DENNIS IS GRADUALLY MOVING EASTWARD ALLOWING THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO MOVE TOWARD WEST-NORTHWEST. WITH A NEW TROUGH APPROACHING
THE AREA...DENNIS SHOULD GRADUALLY TURN TO THE NORTH BEYOND 36
HOURS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS WHICH IN
GENERAL...MOVE THE CYCLONE INLAND IN ABOUT 24 HOURS OR SO.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS DENNIS NEAR THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST WITHIN
THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 24 HOURS OR LESS AND THEREAFTER...OVER
EASTERN VIRGINIA.  WHILE INLAND...DENNIS WILL LIKELY PRODUCE HEAVY
RAINS.
 
LATEST PRESSURE FROM THE RECON WAS 986 MB WITH A 25 N MI DIAMETER
CENTER AND FLIGHT-LEVEL PEAK-WINDS OF 66 KNOTS. SATELLITE LOOPS
INDICATE THAT DEEP CONVECTION HAS BEEN INTERMITTENT DURING THE PAST
COUPLE OF DAYS AND IS STILL DISORGANIZED.  SHIPS...GFDL AND GFDL
COUPLED MODELS STRENGTHEN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  MOREOVER...GFDL AND
GFDL COUPLE FORECAST A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF ABOUT 972 AND 976 MB
RESPECTIVELY AT LANDFALL.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS ABOUT
60 KNOTS NEAR LANDFALL.  HOWEVER...DENNIS IS ABOUT TO MOVE OVER THE
GULF STREAM... WHILE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO RELAX.  WINDS COULD
INCREASE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN INDICATED.

WSR-88D DATA FROM MOREHEAD CITY INDICATE THAT DENNIS IS BECOMING
BETTER ORGANIZED THIS MORNING...WITH REFLECTIVITY DATA INDICATING A
FORMATIVE EYEWALL AND DOPPLER WINDS SHOWING 65 KT ALOFT AND AN INNER
CORE FORMING. THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 55 KT FOR
THIS ADVISORY.

THE RADAR DATA ALSO INDICATES THAT DENNIS IS MOVING FASTER WITH AN
INITIAL MOTION OF 315/8. LARGE SCALE MODELS AND NHC HURRICANE
GUIDANCE ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON A NORTHWEST TRACK FOR 24 TO 36
HOURS FOLLOWED BY GRADUAL RECURVATURE TO THE NORTHEAST AHEAD OF A
LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHING FROM THE GREAT LAKES. THE
FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO...ALTHOUGH FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS

WITH THE INCREASED ORGANIZATION AND PASSAGE OVER THE GULF STREAM...
DENNIS IS FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN TO A 65 KT HURRICANE BY LANDFALL IN
12 HOURS. THE CYCLONE WILL WEAKEN AFTER LANDFALL...BUT DUE TO THE
LARGE SIZE AND GENERALLY FAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL ENVIRONMENT THE
WEAKENING MAY BE SLOWER THAN NORMAL. DENNIS IS FORECAST TO BECOME

AIRCRAFT AND RADAR DATA INDICATE THAT DENNIS IS VERY CLOSE TO
HURRICANE STRENGTH AS IT MAKES LANDFALL. A GPS DROPSONDE INDICATED
63 KT SURFACE WINDS NORTH OF THE CENTER...AND THE LATEST CENTRAL
PRESSURE FROM THE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT IS 984 MB. THE LATEST
RADAR SUGGESTS THE WINDS ARE STARTING TO DIMINISH AS THE EYEWALL
MOVES ONSHORE...SO DENNIS WILL BE KEPT AS A 60 KT TROPICAL STORM ON
THIS PACKAGE. ALTHOUGH FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS UNLIKELY...ANY
STRENGTHENING WOULD MAKE DENNIS A HURRICANE. THUS...HURRICANE
WARNINGS ARE CONTINUED AT LEAST UNTIL THE CORE PASSES BEYOND THE
PAMLICO SOUND. THE CYCLONE HAS A LARGE CIRCULATION...SO WEAKENING
AFTER LANDFALL MAY BE SLOWER THAN NORMAL. DENNIS IS LIKELY TO BECOME
EXTRATROPICAL BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORECAST TRACK OR THE FORECAST TRACK
PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. DENNIS SHOULD CONTINUE
NORTHWEST INTO NORTHERN NORTH CAROLINA...FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL
RECURVATURE THROUGH THE MID ATLANTIC STATES IN ADVANCE OF THE LARGE
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH ADVANCING EASTWARD FROM THE GREAT PLAINS. ONE
INTERESTING NOTE IS THAT DESPITE A SLIGHTLY FASTER INITIAL MOTION...
AVIATION MODEL-BASED GUIDANCE MOVES DENNIS SLOWER AFTER RECURVATURE
THAN 6 HOURS AGO. THE 72 HOUR POSITION IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THIS

RATHER SLOW MOTION AND LOSES THE STORM BY 48 HOURS.  THE 18Z GFDL

MOREHEAD CITY RADAR AND SURFACE REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE
WINDS ARE NO HIGHER THAN 45 KNOTS WHICH WILL BE THE ADVISORY VALUE. 
TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE STILL UP BUT WILL PROBABLY BE LOWERED IN

AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INVESTIGATED THE SMALL DISTURBANCE
EAST OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS AND FOUND A WELL DEFINED AND TIGHT LOW-
LEVEL CIRCULATION OF 1004 MB AND 55-KNOTS WINDS. THEREFORE THE
SYSTEM HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM EMILY.  

EMILY IS A SMALL STORM AND IS UNDER SOME NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR WHICH
IS FORECAST TO RELAX.  SHIPS MODELS MAKES EMILY A 92-KNOT HURRICANE
BY 60 HOURS.  THEREFORE A GRADUAL INTENSIFICATION IS INDICATED IN
THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST.

EMILY IS MEANDERING AT THIS TIME. IT APPEARS THAT MUCH LARGER
CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH APPROACHING CINDY IS CUTTING THE
EASTERLY STEERING CURRENTS.  HOWEVER...MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS
FORECAST EMILY TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND BRING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
TO THE NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN BY 72 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
MOVES EMILY VERY SLOWLY DURING THE FIRST 24 TO 36 HOURS AND THEN
INCREASES THE FORWARD SPEED. WATCHES AND WARNING FOR A PORTION OF

THE WELL-DEFINED SURFACE CIRCULATION OF EMILY IS NOW EXPOSED WITH 
LIMITED DEEP CONVECTION MAINLY SOUTH OF THE CENTER. THE CENTER HAS
BEEN MOVING NORTHWARD OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS OR SO BASED ON SATELLITE
ESTIMATES. THIS MAY BE PARTIALLY DUE TO TROPICAL STORM CINDY WHICH
IS DISRUPTING THE EASTERLY TRADEWIND FLOW AROUND EMILY.   THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 355/06 KTS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BENDS
EMILY BACK TOWARD THE NORTHWEST WITHIN 12 HOURS OR SO HOWEVER...
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN THIS FORECAST THERE IS A
POSSIBILITY THAT EMILY MAY BECOME ABSORBED INTO THE LARGER
CIRCULATION OF CINDY DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 

THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF EMILY HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 40 KTS FOR THIS

CONVECTION. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO EXPERIENCING MODEST EASTERLY SHEAR.
SHEAR...10 TO 15 KT.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST HAS BEEN TRIMMED BACK

THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION OF EMILY REMAINS WELL-DEFINED WITH A NEW
BURST OF CONVECTION DEVELOPING JUST SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER. SINCE
THE DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF
WHAT THE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT FOUND YESTERDAY AFTERNOON...THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS UNCERTAIN. THE MAXIMUM WINDS WILL REMAIN 40 KT
FOR THIS ADVISORY.

MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY AROUND THE ECLIPSE PERIOD SUGGESTS THAT EMILY
HAS STARTED A NORTHWEST MOTION. THE INITIAL MOTION FOR THIS PACKAGE
WILL BE 335/5...WHICH IS THE 12 HOUR MOTION. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE
IS CLUSTERED AROUND A NORTH-NORTHWEST TRACK AND IS IN MUCH BETTER
AGREEMENT THAN SIX HOURS AGO...WITH THE ONLY OUTLIERS TO THE RIGHT
BEING THE NOGAPS AND THE UKMET. THIS AGREEMENT LOOKS A LITTLE
STRANGE GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERACTION WITH CINDY. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL BE SHIFTED ONLY SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH AND IS
A COMPROMISE BETWEEN A TRACK PRODUCED BY INTERACTION WITH CINDY AND
A MORE NORTHWESTERLY MOTION UNDER THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS PROBLEMATICAL. IF EMILY GETS CAUGHT IN THE
LARGER CIRCULATION OF CINDY...IT WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE SIMILAR TO
HOW KAREN DISSIPATED WHILE INTERACTING WITH IRIS IN 1995. ON THE
OTHER HAND...THE SHIPS MODEL CONTINUES TO BRING EMILY TO HURRICANE
STATUS BY 60 HOURS...WHICH COULD OCCUR IF EMILY STAYS FAR ENOUGH
AWAY FROM CINDY. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR SLOW AND STEADY
INTENSIFICATION SIMILAR TO...BUT A LITTLE SLOWER THAN...THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE. THIS IS BASED ON THE CONTINUED EASTERLY SHEAR AND CURRENT
LACK OF CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION.
 
ALTHOUGH THE FORECAST TRACK DOES NOT PRESENTLY CALL FOR LANDFALL...

REMAINS A VERY COMPACT STORM.  THE FUTURE INTENSITY OF EMILY DEPENDS
IN GREAT MEASURE ON ITS TRACK RELATIVE TO CINDY AND DENNIS.  AS THE
SMALLEST OF THE THREE...EMILY WILL BE THE LEAST ABLE TO GOVERN ITS
OWN FATE.  SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE BRINGS EMILY TO 79 KNOTS IN 72
HOURS.  ALTHOUGH I BRING EMILY TO HURRICANE STRENGTH DURING THE

OUTFLOW COULD EVENTUALLY ADVERSLY AFFECT EMILY.

A RECENT AIR FORCE FIX SHOWS THAT EMILY HAS ACQUIRED A LITTLE MORE
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION SINCE THIS AFTERNOON.  THIS MAY BE A
RESULT OF THE INFLUENCE OF NEARBY HURRICANE CINDY.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A MOSTLY NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR

BEING DISRUPTED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE HURRICANE CINDY TO THE

THESE TWO SYSTEMS WILL BE INCREASING WITH TIME...SO THE HOSTILE
INFLUENCE OF CINDY SHOULD LESSEN.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST
MODEL INDICATES DECREASING SHEAR OVER EMILY...AND SHOWS THE STORM
STRENGTHENING TO A HURRICANE IN 36 TO 48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS NOT AS AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE OTHER SOURCES OF VERTICAL
SHEARING... SUCH AS AN UPPER LOW NOW JUST NORTH OF 20N OR THE UPPER
OUTFLOW FROM HURRICANE DENNIS...COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON

INVESTIGATING EMILY...WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE WEAKENED SINCE LAST

FORCE WINDS HAVE BEEN FOUND...ALTHOUGH THE AIRCRAFT HAS NOT YET
COMPLETED ITS PATTERN.  I WILL KEEP EMILY AS A TROPICAL STORM WITH
THIS ADVISORY...BUT UNLESS ITS APPEARANCE IMPROVES THIS
AFTERNOON...I WILL HAVE TO DOWNGRADE EMILY TO A DEPRESSION FOR THE
NEXT ADVISORY.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR OVER EMILY
SHOULD LESSEN WITH TIME...IN RESPONSE TO THE OUTFLOW PATTERNS OF
CINDY AND DENNIS.  OUR INTENSITY FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR EMILY TO
STRENGTHEN IN THE LONG TERM...BUT IT WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO SURVIVE
THE NEXT DAY OR SO FIRST.

EMILY IS ESTIMATED TO BE MOVING 320/7...ABOUT THE SAME AS THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE UKMET STILL BRINGS EMILY AROUND THE EAST
SIDE OF CINDY...AN OPTION THAT SEEMS QUITE UNLIKELY GIVEN THE
CURRENT MOTIONS OF CINDY AND EMILY.  THE REMAINING GUIDANCE SHOWS A
NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  GIVEN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK...AND THE SIZE AND STRENGTH OF EMILY...THERE IS STILL
NO NEED FOR ANY WATCHES AND/OR WARNINGS.

AIRCRAFT RECONNAISSANCE REPROTS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATE THAT 
EMILY IS BEING DISTORTED AND WEAKENED BY THE CIRCULATION OF CINDY. 
THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION OF EMILY NOW ELONGATED TO THE NORTH...WITH
A MID LEVEL CIRCULATION BEING LEFT BEHIND 150 NM TO THE SOUTH OF THE
LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION.  OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS CONVECTION HAS
INCREASED IN BETWEEN THE TWO CIRCULATIONS...BUT THIS IS NOT
INTERPRETED AS A RESTRENGTHENING OF THE CYCLONE.  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
PROBABLY SOME GUSTS TO TROPICAL STORM FORCE REMAINING...EMILY WILL
BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION ON THIS ADVISORY.
 
EMILY IS NOW MOVING WITH THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW AND THE INTIAL MOTION IS
NOW ESTIMATED AS 350/9.  GIVEN THIS MOTION AND THE DOWNGRADE TO
DEPRESSION STATUS...THE THREAT TO THE LESSER ANTILLES IS DIMINISHED.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE AND IS CLOSE TO THE SHALLOW BAM MODEL.

SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL RETURNS EMILY TO HURRICANE STATUS IN
72 HOURS...AND THIS IS STILL POSSIBLE IF THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION
CAN PERSIST LONG ENOUGH FOR EMILY AND CINDY TO SEPARATE.  HOWEVER...
THE OUTFLOW FROM DENNIS IS NOT LIKELY TO PROVIDE A FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT EITHER...SO WE WILL HOLD DEPRESSION STRENGTH THROUGH THE

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT DEEP CONVECTION HAS
INCREASED AROUND EMILYS LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER DURING THE PAST

NOT SURPRISINGLY...WITH A WEAK SYSTEM THE TRACK MODELS ARE BECOMING
A LITTLE DIVERGENT WITH THE UKMET AND NOGAPS GOING OFF TOWARD THE

MODELS MOVE THE SYSTEM OFF TOWARD THE NORTHWEST BUT DIFFER IN SPEED

SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL RETURNS EMILY TO TROPICAL STORM

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER MADE TWO CENTER FIXES ON EMILY
THAT WERE 50 NM APART. THE SECOND FIX HAD THE BETTER DEFINED CENTER
WITH A 1009 MB PRESSURE AND 44 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS TO THE EAST.
THIS SUGGESTS THAT EMILY IS CLOSE TO REGAINING TROPICAL STORM
INTENSITY. SINCE THE FIXES WERE SO FAR APART...AND THE ASSOCIATED
DEEP CONVECTION IS VERY POORLY ORGANIZED...THE SYSTEM REMAINS A
DEPRESSION ON THIS PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. THE SECOND AIRCRAFT FIX
WOULD SUGGEST A NORTH-NORTHEAST MOTION. THE INITIAL POSITION AND
MOTION...360/10...ARE BASED ON A BLEND OF THE TWO FIXES. THE
AVIATION-BASED GUIDANCE TURNS EMILY TO THE NORTHWEST...WHILE THE
NOGAPS AND UKMET TRACK THE CYCLONE NORTHWARD IN RESPONSE TO CINDY.
THE FORECAST TRACK STILL CALLS FOR A NORTHWESTWARD TURN...BUT IT IS
SHIFTED TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK. IF VISIBLE
SATELLITE IMAGERY VERIFIES THE NORTH-NORTHEAST MOTION...BOTH THE
POSITION AND THE TRACK WILL NEED TO BE RE-LOCATED.

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS DEVELOPING WEST OF EMILY...WITH RIDGING
OVER THE CENTER AT THIS TIME. THIS SUGGESTS A MORE FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT THAN 24 HOURS AGO...AND THE SHIPS MODEL CONTINUES TO RE-
INTENSIFY THE SYSTEM. GIVEN THE RAGGED APPEARANCE...AND THE

OF 49 KT AT 1500 FT AND A PRESSURE OF 1007 MB...DOWN 3 MB FROM THIS
MORNING.  THE AIRCRAFT ALSO REPORTED DEVELOPING CONVECTION OVER THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  THEREFORE EMILY IS UPGRADED AGAIN TO TROPICAL
STORM STATUS.  

THE MOTION IS NOW RELIABLY ESTIMATED AT 360/10.  TRACK GUIDANCE
GIVES MOSTLY A NORTH-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION OVER THE FORECAST
PERIOD...ALTHOUGH THERE IS DISAGREEMENT ON WHETHER EMILY WILL BE
BENDING TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT AFTER 48 HOURS.  THE PRIMARY
SYNOPTIC FEATURE IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW TO THE
WEST OF THE CYCLONE...ALTHOUGH EMILY MAY BE TOO SHALLOW TO FEEL THIS
LOW.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...THE

WITH THE UPPER LOW TO THE WEST OF EMILY...THE NORTHERLY SHEAR THAT
HAS BEEN AFFECTING THE CYCLONE IS DIMINISHING...AND WE PERMIT SOME
SLIGHT STRENGTHENING DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS...BUT NOT AS MUCH AS

TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE GENERALLY MOVES THE SYSTEM NORTHWARD WITH A

LOW CLOUD ELEMENTS TO THE WEST OF EMILY ARE MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST

EMILY IS GETTING ENTRAINED INTO CINDY. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT EMILY WILL MOVE AROUND THE SOUTHEAST
SIDE OF CINDY UNTIL IT DISSIPATES.

STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH OUTFLOW FROM CINDY AND AN

SOUTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY.
SATELLITE IMAGERY ALONG WITH MEXICAN SURFACE AND RADAR DATA INDICATE
A SURFACE CIRCULATION HAS FORMED WITH SUFFICIENT ORGANIZED
CONVECTION TO BE DECLARED A TROPICAL DEPRESSION. 

THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN...BUT IS ESTIMATED TO BE A NORTH-
NORTHWEST DRIFT...335/2. LARGE SCALE RIDGING EAST OF THE CYCLONE
SHOULD ALLOW FOR A GENERAL NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION...ALTHOUGH RIDGING
SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER NORTHERN MEXICO AND TEXAS MAY KEEP
THE MOTION SLOW. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE...RUN USING A STATIONARY
INITIAL MOTION...INDICATED A NORTH-NORTHWEST TRACK. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS FOR A NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION WITH LANDFALL IN
NORTHEASTERN MEXICO IN 24 TO 36 HOURS. ONE POSSIBILITY TO KEEP AN
EYE ON IS THAT THE DEPRESSION MAY TRY TO IMITATE BRET...WITH A MORE
NORTHERLY TRACK AND MORE TIME OVER WATER.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING TO TROPICAL
STORM INTENSITY JUST BEFORE LANDFALL...FOLLOWED BY DISSIPATION OVER
LAND. ON THIS BASIS...THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO HAS ISSUED A TROPICAL

NORTH.

THERE IS ALMOST NO DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER WHICH ALLOWS THE
FORECAST TO BE FOR VERY SLOW STRENGTHENING.  ALSO THE PROXIMITY TO

THERE IS SOME DOUBT ABOUT THE CENTER LOCATION OF THE CYCLONE ON
INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY.  BROWNSVILLE RADAR ANIMATION SUGGESTS
THAT THE CENTER IS ALREADY ON THE COAST OF MEXICO...BUT SINCE THE
CENTER IS ABOUT 200 MILES FROM THE RADAR THIS IS SPECULATIVE. 
IMAGES FROM THE TAMPICO MEXICO RADAR ARE INCONCLUSIVE.  LACKING
DEFINITIVE INFORMATION...THE CURRENT POSITION AND MOTION ESTIMATES
ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE AND HAVE CONTINUITY WITH THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORIES.  IN ANY EVENT A CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT MOVEMENT
WOULD BRING THE CENTER ACROSS THE COAST LATER TODAY.  A WEAK MID-
LEVEL RIDGE ACROSS SOUTHERN TEXAS SHOULD CAUSE A GRADUAL BEND OF THE
TRACK TOWARD THE LEFT WITH TIME.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT A LITTLE FASTER.

AFTER THE USUAL DIURNAL DECREASE...CONVECTION HAS INCREASED IN
ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEPRESSION THIS MORNING.  THE UPPER-LEVEL
OUTFLOW PATTERN OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE OF THE SYSTEM LOOKS
FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE.  THE ONLY OBVIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO STRENGTHENING IS
LANDFALL...WHICH SEEMS IMMINENT AT THIS TIME.  IF THE CENTER IS

BROWNSVILLE WSR-88 DATA INDICATES THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION
SEVEN HAS MOVED INLAND OVER NORTHEAST MEXICO...ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE
CIRCULATION REMAINS OVER WATER. THE CENTER HAS BEEN MOVING 320/9 FOR
THE PAST 12 HOURS...AND A SLOWER NORTHWESTERLY MOTION IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE UNTIL THE CYCLONE DISSIPATES IN 24 TO 36 HOURS.
 
THE SATELLITE AND RADAR APPEARANCE SUGGESTS THE DEPRESSION WAS CLOSE
TO TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH AT LANDFALL...ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO
OBSERVATIONS OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS. THE LANDFALL ENDS THE
CHANCE OF STRENGTHENING...SO THE FOCUS NOW SHIFTS TO HEAVY RAINFALL.
THE BROWNSVILLE RADAR SHOWS A LARGE RAIN SHIELD ASSOCIATED WITH THE
CYCLONE...AND SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE BAND STILL OVER
THE GULF EAST OF THE CENTER. WIDESPREAD HEAVY RAINS ARE LIKELY OVER
NORTHEASTERN MEXICO AND PORTIONS OF EXTREME SOUTH TEXAS. THESE COULD
CONTINUED EVEN AFTER THE SYSTEM OFFICIALLY DISSIPATES.

BROWNSVILLE WSR-88 DATA INDICATES THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION
SEVEN SLOWED AFTER LANDFALL IN NORTHEASTERN MEXICO...AND HAS AT BEST
DRIFTED WEST-NORTHWEST FOR THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. IT MAY BE THAT A
MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER NORTHWEST MEXICO AND WESTERN TEXAS HAS
SLOWED THE MOTION...ALTHOUGH LOW CLOUD MOTIONS NORTH OF THE CYCLONE
SUGGEST A SOUTHEASTERLY STEERING FLOW IS PRESENT AT THAT LEVEL. THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST CALLS FOR A SLOW WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION
UNTIL DISSIPATION.

THE SATELLITE APPEARANCE HAS CHANGED LITTLE DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS...AND DOPPLER RADAR WINDS IN THE BAND EAST OF THE CENTER ARE
TROPICAL STORM FORCE FROM 5000-7000 FT. THUS...THE DEPRESSION IS
MAINTAINING ITSELF EVEN THOUGH THE CENTER IS INLAND. WHILE
DISSIPATION OVER LAND IS THE FORECAST...THERE ARE TWO POSSIBILITIES
THAT REQUIRE WATCHING. FIRST...THAT THE CENTER MAY REFORM OVER
WATER...WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE CYCLONE TO STRENGTHEN INTO A TROPICAL
STORM. SECOND...THAT SINCE THE PRIMARY CONVECTION REMAINS OVER WATER
THE SYSTEM COULD STRENGTHEN EVEN THOUGH THE CENTER IS OVER LAND. 

HEAVY RAINFALL SHOULD CONTINUE NEAR AND EAST OF THE CENTER...AND MAY
PERSIST EVEN AFTER THE SYSTEM DISSIPATES AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE.

LAST VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY AND BROWNSVILLE RADAR INDICATE THAT
THE CENTER HAS NOT MOVED MUCH LATELY AND IS ALSO NOT FAR FROM THE
COAST.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 325/01.  THE UKMET AND GFDL
MODELS SHOW A SLOW NORTHWESTWARD MOTION WHILE THE NOGAPS IS SLOW
SOUTHWESTWARD.  ALL THE OTHERS MOVE THE DEPRESSION FAIRLY FAST
TOWARD THE WEST.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS FOR SLOW
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOLLOWED BY DISSIPATION AT 48 HOURS IF NOT
SOONER.

THE DEEP CONVECTION OVER WATER HAS FIZZLED DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS
AND THIS REDUCES THE CHANCES OF INTENSIFICATION.  BUT TO ERR ON THE
SIDE OF CAUTION...ADVISORIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE ISSUED FOR A WHILE
LONGER.  

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL PRECIP...UP TO 3 INCHES PER HOUR...OVER
MEXICO...FROM THE BROWNSVILLE RADAR SO THE THREAT OF FLASH FLOODING
CONTINUES.

CENTER FIXES USING WSR-88D IMAGES FROM BROWNSVILLE INDICATE A
CONTINUED NORTHWESTWARD DRIFT...ABOUT 325/04.  ALTHOUGH THE CENTER
HAS BEEN INLAND FOR ABOUT 18 HOURS...THERE ARE STILL STRONG FEEDER
BANDS COMING ONSHORE OVER EXTREME NORTHEAST MEXICO AND NEAR THE
TEXAS BORDER.  30-KNOT WINDS ARE STILL POSSIBLE IN SOME THESE BANDS.

WEAKENING IS LIKELY...WITH THE CYCLONE DISSIPATING IN 36 HOURS OR
SOONER. 

TRACK GUIDANCE IS VARIED...BUT IT APPEARS THAT THERE SHOULD BE
ENOUGH RIDGING TO THE NORTH SO THAT THE DEPRESSION WILL MOVE FARTHER
INLAND DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
ROUGHLY AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.

THE THREAT OF FLOODING DUE TO HEAVY RAINS SHOULD CONTINUE TODAY OVER

325/5. THE CENTER HAS BECOME POORLY DEFINED IN BOTH RADAR AND
SATELLITE IMAGERY AS MORE OF THE CONVECTION HAS SPREAD INLAND. THE

HOURS. HOWEVER...THE REMNANT LOW IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE PRODUCING
HEAVY RAINS OVER NORTHEASTERN MEXICO AND SOUTH TEXAS.

THIS WILL BE THE LAST ADVISORY ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION SEVEN ISSUED

TROPICAL DEPRESSION EIGHT DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 PM EST TUE SEP 07 1999
 
THE TROPICAL WAVE OVER THE CENTRAL TROPICAL ATLANTIC HAS DEVELOPED A
BROAD CYCLONIC CIRCULATION AND SUFFICIENT ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO BE
CALLED A TROPICAL DEPRESSION. THUS...ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON
TROPICAL DEPRESSION EIGHT. THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE SET TO 
25 KT BASED ON SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 30 KT AND 25 KT FROM
TAFB AND SAB...RESPECTIVELY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE BROAD CENTER...
WITH THE BEST ESTIMATES 280/12. IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IF THE
CENTER JUMPED AROUND WITHIN THE BROAD CIRCULATION UNTIL THE SYSTEM
CONSOLIDATES. A LARGE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE IS NORTH OF THE CYCLONE...
WHICH WOULD SUPPORT A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK. NHC HURRICANE
GUIDANCE GENERALLY AGREES WITH THIS...ALTHOUGH THE BAM MODELS WANT
TO TAKE THE SYSTEM FURTHER NORTH. THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS IN BEST
AGREEMENT WITH CLIPER...LBAR... AND THE GFDL.

THE CONVECTION IS NOT VERY CONCENTRATED...AND WITH A SYSTEM AT THIS
STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY IT MAY ALL DISAPPEAR
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE CIRCULATION IS LARGE AND THE UPPER LEVEL
WINDS ARE FAVORABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT. THUS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST
IS FOR SLOW AND STEADY STRENGTHENING AS THE SYSTEM CONSOLIDATES...
FOLLOWED BY MORE RAPID STRENGTHENING.

SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION IS
GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED WHILE MOVING TOWARD INCREASINGLY
WARMER WATERS.  THIS SYSTEM HAS A LARGE LOW-LEVEL CYCLONIC ENVELOPE
WITH PLENTY OF BANDING FEATURES AND AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW. THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER IS NOT WELL DEFINED YET.  IT IS VERY NEAR TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH.

BOTH SHIPS AND THE GFDL MODELS BRING THE DEPRESSION TO ABOUT 80 AND
100 KNOTS RESPECTIVELY BY 72 HOURS AND GLOBAL MODELS DEVELOP AN EVEN
LARGER UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM.  STRENGTHENING
IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST.  THIS DEPRESSION
HAS ALL THE INGREDIENTS...THAT WE KNOW OF...TO BECOME A MAJOR
HURRICANE EVENTUALLY.  
 
BECAUSE THE DEPRESSION DOES NOT HAVE A WELL DEFINED CENTER YET...THE
INITIAL LOCATION AND MOTION ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME.  THE
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14...BUT ONCE THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER BECOMES ESTABLISHED...THE POSITION WILL PROBABLY HAVE
TO BE READJUSTED...MORE LIKELY TO THE RIGHT...IF THE CENTER REFORMS
WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION. 

ALL AVAILABLE MODELS...WITH NO EXCEPTION...TURN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
GRADUALLY TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND THEN NORTHWARD NORTH...BYPASSING
THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.  THIS IN RESPONSE TO A WEAKENING OF THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WEST OF 70W AND A STRONG APPROACHING MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH.  THIS IS REALISTIC BECAUSE THAT PATTERN HAS BEEN A
PERSISTENT FEATURE THIS SUMMER. BOTH THE OFFICIAL NHC AND HPC
FORECASTS ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE AND ARE ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE
TRACK ENSEMBLE AND VERY CLOSE TO LBAR...WHICH HAS BEEN PERFORMING
QUITE WELL IN THE DEEP TROPICS.  HOWEVER...IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT
THE FORECAST TRACK WILL HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT LATER
ON...IN AGREEMENT WITH THE GLOBAL MODELS.

ON INFRARED IMAGES...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER
ORGANIZED.  BANDING FEATURES...WITH VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS...WRAP
ABOUT HALF WAY AROUND THE SYSTEM CENTER.  THIS GIVES A DATA T-
NUMBER OF 2.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE.  BOTH TAFB MIAMI AND SAB
WASHINGTON AGREE ON 35 KNOTS FOR THE CURRENT INTENSITY...SO THE
CYCLONE IS BEING NAMED ON THIS ADVISORY.  AS NOTED EARLIER...THERE
IS AN IMPRESSIVE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
THE STORM AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO WARM ALONG
THE PROJECTED TRACK.  THEREFORE STEADY STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST. 
FLOYD HAS A LARGE CIRCULATION ENVELOPE...TYPICAL FOR CAPE VERDE-
TYPE STORMS DURING THE PEAK OF THE SEASON.  FLOYD IS A GOOD
CANDIDATE TO ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS.

SINCE IT IS A BROAD SYSTEM STILL IN THE DEVELOPING STAGE...THE
CENTER IS NOT YET WELL-DEFINED.  HOWEVER MY BEST ESTIMATE FOR THE
INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14...AS BEFORE.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A
MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE JUST EAST OF BERMUDA AT THIS
TIME.  THIS FEATURE COULD CREATE ENOUGH OF A WEAKNESS IN THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE SO THAT FLOYDS COURSE WOULD VEER MORE TO THE
NORTHWEST IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  IF NOT...THEN THE MAIN FEATURE THAT
WOULD INFLUENCE THE TRACK OF THE STORM WOULD BE A LARGE MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH MOVING TOWARD THE U.S. EAST COAST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THIS WOULD ERODE THE RIDGE OVER THE AREA NORTH OF THE
GREATER ANTILLES...AND CAUSE FLOYD TO TURN MORE NORTHWARD IN ROUGHLY
3 DAYS TIME.  HOWEVER...THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN 3-DAY
TRACK PREDICTIONS.  THE BAROTROPIC TRACK PREDICTION
MODEL...LBAR...WHICH SHOULD HANDLE SYSTEMS IN THE DEEP TROPICS
FAIRLY WELL...SHOWS A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TRACK THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED ONLY

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/13.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A
MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC LOW JUST EAST OF BERMUDA...AND GIVEN THE
LARGE SIZE OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE...THIS COULD CREATE ENOUGH OF A
WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO TURN FLOYD ON A MORE
NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.  EITHER THIS LOW...OR THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH

INITIAL INTENSITY IS 50 KNOTS...BASED ON AVERAGE ESTIMATES FROM TAFB
AND SAB.  FLOYD HAS BANDING FEATURES...EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND A LARGE
LOW-LEVEL CYCLONIC ENVELOPE BUT IT LACKS AN INNER CORE.  UNTIL AN
INNER CORE FORMS...AND THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF THIS FEATURE FORMING AT
THIS TIME...NO RAPID STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR.  SHIPS AND
GFDL INSIST ON BRINGING THE HURRICANE TO 93 AND 101 KNOTS
RESPECTIVELY BY 72 HOURS.  THESE MODELS ARE THE ONLY OPERATIONAL
TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR INTENSITY AT THE TIME OF THE FORECAST. 
THEREFORE...FLOYD IS FORECAST TO REACH 95 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS...AFTER
A SLOW STRENGTHENING DURING THE FIRST 24 HOURS.  IF THE INNER CORE
DOES NOT FORM...THE RAPID INTENSIFICATION WILL NOT TAKE PLACE. 

SINCE THE CENTER IS NOT WELL ORGANIZED...THE INITIAL MOTION IS
UNCERTAIN BUT BEST ESTIMATE IS 285/14.   THIS IS BASED ON SATELLITE
FIXES A LITTLE TO THE SOUTH OF EARLIER POSITIONS.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGES SHOW A LARGE UPPER-TROUGH/SHEAR AXIS EXTENDING FROM THE
CENTRAL CARIBBEAN TO A LOW NEAR BERMUDA.  THIS FEATURE SHOULD FORCE
FLOYD TO TURN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST IN A DAY OR TWO.  THEREAFTER...
ANOTHER LARGE TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO BE ALONG THE EASTERN
UNITED STATES WILL LIKELY TURN FLOYD TO THE NORTH.  THE LATEST GFDL
SUGGESTS THAT THE WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH 72
HOURS...A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS INTEGRATION AND
THE UK MODEL INDICATES A RECURVATURE MORE TO THE WEST THAN IN
EARLIER RUN. THE AVN HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN TURNING THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE GRADUALLY NORTHWARD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO
LBAR...WHICH IS GOOD IN THE DEEP TROPICS AND THE GFDL BUT STILL ON
THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE TRACK MODEL ENSEMBLE. 

ON THIS TRACK...FLOYD WILL BE PASSING NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS
BUT ONLY A SMALL DEVIATION TO THE LEFT...COULD BRING A PORTION OF
THE CIRCULATION OVER THE NORTHERNMOST ISLANDS. INTERESTS
IN THE NORTHERN LEEWARD SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF FLOYD.

AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE AREA
EARLY MORNING.  THEN...WE WILL HAVE GOOD MEASUREMENTS OF THE

FOUND THAT THE STORM IS PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK...BUT THAT THE PREVIOUS
INTENSITY ESTIMATES WERE A BIT ON THE HIGH SIDE.  ON TWO DROPS INTO
THE EYE...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS MEASURED 1002 AND 1003 MB.  SURFACE
WIND MEASUREMENTS AT THE DROPWINSONDE SPLASH POINTS SUGGEST THAT
NEITHER DROP WAS QUITE AT THE SURFACE CENTER POSITION HOWEVER. 
ALTHOUGH THE FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS DO NOT SUPPORT AS STRONG A STORM AS
WE THOUGHT...FOR THE SAKE OF CONTINUITY...THE CURRENT INTENSITY IS
KEPT AT 50 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  ON THE LARGE SCALE...THE CLOUD
PATTERN CONTINUES TO LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH STRONG UPPER-LEVEL
OUTFLOW EVIDENT.  RECENT GOES-8 IMAGES AFTER THE SATELLITE ECLIPSE
SHOW THE CONVECTION CONSOLIDATING AND INTENSIFYING OVER THE

NORTHWARD ADJUSTMENT IS MADE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...BUT
THE PROGNOSTIC REASONING IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.  THE MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE STORM IS PREDICTED TO
GRADUALLY WEAKEN WITH TIME...THUS THE NHC FORECAST SHOWS SOME
SLOWING OF FORWARD SPEED AND A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.   
THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTIONS AS WELL...AND
KEEPS FLOYD TO THE NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.  HOWEVER...IF THE
STORM DOES NOT TURN MORE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...A PORTION OF FLOYDS
LARGE CIRCULATION COULD AFFECT THE NORTHERNMOST OF THESE ISLANDS. 
INTERESTS IN THE NORTHERN LEEWARD SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC FLOW OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
DURING THE NEXT 3 TO 5 DAYS IS CRITICAL FOR THE LONGER-RANGE TRACK
OF FLOYD.  IF THE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES LIFTS OUT LATER
THIS WEEKEND...THEN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY
RECURVE...OR EVEN TURN BACK TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST OR WEST. 
THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION OF THIS IN THE LATEST RUNS OF THE GFDL AND
AVN MODELS.  AT THIS JUNCTURE...THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
SPECULATION.

FLOYD IS LOOKING MUCH STRONGER ON SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS
MORNING...WITH A VERY COLD CDO.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB AND SAB ARE 65 KT...HURRICANE STRENGTH.  HOWEVER...AIR FORCE
RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE LAST NIGHT FOUND THAT THE WINDS WERE NOT AS
HIGH AS THE SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS.  OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS HELD
AT 50 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.  ANOTHER AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN THE SYSTEM
THIS AFTERNOON.  FLOYD APPEARS POISED TO UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTHENING.  
 
THE INITIAL MOTION OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS HAS BEEN DUE WESTWARD...
BUT THE LONGER TERM MOTION USED TO INITIALIZE THE MODELS WAS 280/12. 
ALL MODEL GUIDANCE TAKES FLOYD TO THE NORTH OF THE ISLANDS...FAR
ENOUGH THAT NO WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME. 
HOWEVER...IF THE WESTWARD MOTION CONTINUES MUCH LONGER...THEY MAY BE
NECESSARY THIS AFTERNOON.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED
SOUTHWARD OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND IS BETWEEN THE LBAR AND
GFDL.  FOR THE LONGER TERM...OF INTEREST IS THE WESTWARD BEND IN THE
GFDL AND LBAR LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THERE ARE HINTS THAT THE
MAJOR TROUGH NOW APPROACHING THE U.S. EAST COAST MAY NOT BE
SUFFICIENT TO RECURVE FLOYD.

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATING
FLOYD THIS AFTERNOON HAS PRESENTED US WITH MIXED SIGNALS.  THE
CENTER LOCATED BY THE AIRCRAFT WAS NORTHWEST OF THE PREVIOUS
SATELLITE ESTIMATES...AND REMOVED FROM THE DEEP CONVECTION.  ON THE
OTHER HAND...THE AIRCRAFT ALSO FOUND 68 KT AT FLIGHT LEVEL ON THE
NORTHEAST SIDE...SO THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS RAISED TO 60 KT FOR
THIS PACKAGE.  GIVEN THE SEPARATION OF THE CENTER FROM THE
CONVECTION...NOT MUCH MORE SHORT TERM STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY. 
HOWEVER...THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL FORECASTS A 103 KT HURRICANE IN
72 HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THIS GUIDANCE.

THE WESTWARD MOTION NOTED THIS MORNING HAS ENDED.  WITH THE AIRCRAFT
FIXES...THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW BACK TO THE RIGHT...AT 290/13. 
THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL INITIALIZES THE CYCLONE WITH SOME STRANGE-
LOOKING SIDE LOBES OF VORTICITY.  THESE INDUCE A SHARP NORTHWARD...
AND THEN WESTWARD TURN IN THE MODEL OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THIS
DOES NOT SEEM REASONABLE AND I HAVE SMOOTHED OUT THESE WIGGLES TO
GIVE A WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST TRACK THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  

WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT RECONNAISSANCE
DATA.  ALTHOUGH THE FORECAST TRACK IS STILL NORTH OF THE
ISLANDS...GIVEN THESE RADII AND THE TYPICAL ERROR IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...A TROPICAL STORM WATCH IS NOW REQUIRED FOR THE
NORTHEASTERN-MOST LEEWARD ISLANDS.

DESPITE THE APPARENT FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR STRENGTHENING...FLOYD
HAS NOT REACHED HURRICANE STATUS YET.  YES...ON IR IMAGERY...FLOYD
IS VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH EXCELLENT OUTFLOW...VERY DEEP CONVECTION AND
BANDING FEATURES.  IN FACT...T-NUMBERS FROM SAB...TAFB AND KGWC ARE
4.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...SUGGESTING THAT FLOYD IS A HURRICANE. 
HOWEVER... SEVERAL PASSES THROUGH THE CENTER OF FLOYD BY AN AIR
FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS
DECOUPLED FROM THE MID-LEVEL ROTATION OBSERVED IN IR IMAGERY. 
NEITHER THE PRESSURE NOR THE WINDS REPORTED SO FAR BY THE
PLANE...CONFIRM THAT FLOYD IS A HURRICANE. I DO NOT HAVE AN
EXPLANATION WHY STRENGTHENING HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET...BUT I AM
SURE THERE WILL BE MANY EXPLANATIONS OUT THERE LATER.  GIVEN THE
CURRENT SEPARATION OF THE LOW AND MID LEVEL CENTERS...NO SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS. 
THEREAFTER...INTENSIFICATION SHOULD BEGIN AS INDICATED BY SHIPS AND
THE GFDL MODELS AND PREVIOUS FORECAST.

FLOYD HAS SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/9. 
THE TRACK IN THE SHORT TERM...WILL PROBABLY BE CONTROLLED BY A WELL
DEFINED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH/SHEAR AXIS EXTENDING FROM HISPANIOLA
NORTHWARD THROUGH THE ATLANTIC AS OBSERVED IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.
THIS TROUGH MAY FORCE FLOYD ON A TRACK MORE TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST
AND EVEN NORTHWEST DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE
STEERING PATTERN BECOMES MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE GLOBAL MODELS ARE
BEGINNING TO HINT THAT A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC.  THIS FORECAST PATTERN WOULD FAVOR A MORE WEST OR
WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK INSTEAD OF A NORTHWARD TURN OVER OPEN
WATERS.  THIS IS BASED ON SEVERAL RELIABLE MODELS LIKE
LBAR...GFDL...AND THE AVN WHICH TURN FLOYD WESTWARD BY THE END OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  IN ADDITION...THE UK MODEL SUGGESTS A 
NORTHWARD TURN FARTHER TO THE WEST IN EACH UPDATED RUN.  SINCE
MODELS COULD CHANGE AGAIN TO A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK IN THE NEXT
RUN....THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NOT CHANGED AND CONTINUES ON A
GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...MOVING FLOYD NORTH OF THE LEEWARD
ISLANDS AND THEN BENDS THE TRACK A LITTLE TO THE WEST BEYOND 48
HOURS.

LATEST OBSERVATIONS BY THE AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS SHOW A
CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 985 MB WHICH INDICATES THAT FLOYD IS PROBABLY
STRENGTHENING AND WILL LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO A HURRICANE VERY
SOON...ASSUMING THIS IS CORROBORATED BY WIND OBSERVATIONS FROM THE
AIRCRAFT.  THE LAST FIX LOCATION ALSO SHOWS A BIT OF A NORTHWARD
JUMP...INTO A MASS OF DEEP CONVECTION DEPICTED ON SATELLITE IMAGES.
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO BE IMPRESSIVE AND STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST.  FLOYD COULD BE A MAJOR HURRICANE BY THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD.
 
INITIAL MOTION...300/10...IS A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF PREVIOUS
ESTIMATES.  A SYNOPTIC SURVEILLANCE MISSION BY THE NOAA JET SHOWS A
SLIGHT WEAKNESS IN THE 500 MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF FLOYD AND THIS
HAS LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED OVER THE
LAST 12 HOURS OR SO...AND TO THE SLIGHT RIGHTWARD CHANGE IN HEADING.

THERE IS AN UNREALISTIC-LOOKING RING OF VORTICITY SURROUNDING FLOYD
IN THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL INITIALIZATION.  IN THE MODEL SIMULATION...
A NEW VORTEX SPINS UP ALONG THE RING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF STORM AND
MAY HAVE SOME EFFECT ON THE AVN PREDICTED MOVEMENT OF FLOYD...
PERHAPS CARRYING IT TOO FAR TO THE NORTH.  LOOKING AT THE LARGER-
SCALE STEERING MECHANISMS...THE LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER
THE EASTERN STATES IS LIKELY TO LIFT OUT IN A COUPLE OF DAYS OR SO.
THEREAFTER THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A RIDGE BUILDING WESTWARD
INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES AROUND THE 72 HOUR TIME FRAME. IF THIS
VERIFIES...THEN A MORE WESTWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION WOULD DEVELOP
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS IS WHAT IS BEING DEPICTED
BY RECENT RUNS OF THE GFDL MODEL...WHICH TURN FLOYD SHARPLY TOWARD
THE WEST AFTER 48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DOES SHOW A LEFTWARD
BEND NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD...NOT AS DRAMATIC AS THE GFDL BUT
SIMILAR TO THE U.K. MET. OFFICE MODEL WHICH HAS BEEN AN EXCELLENT
PERFORMER IN RECENT YEARS.

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT REPORTED FLIGHT-
LEVEL WINDS OF 88 KT THIS MORNING.  THIS SUPPORTS A SURFACE WIND
ESTIMATE OF 70 KT AND FLOYD IS NOW A HURRICANE.  WIND RADII HAVE
BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON A SURFACE WIND ANALYSIS PROVIDED BY THE NOAA
HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION.  THEIR ANALYSIS ALSO INDICATES A 
MAXIMUM SURFACE WIND OF ABOUT 70 KT.

FLOYD CONTINUES TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY CONSOLIDATING ITS INNER
CORE...AND THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER OF CIRCULATION IS STILL NOT QUITE
CO-LOCATED WITH THE CONVECTION OR MID-LEVEL ROTATION.  THE MOST
RECENT MSLP WAS 989 MB...UP A BIT FROM EARLIER.  THIS PROBABLY
REFLECTS THE POOR INNER ORGANIZATION RATHER THAN A WEAKENING TREND. 
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW REMAINS IMPRESSIVE...IF A BIT RESTRICTED ON THE
NORTHWEST SIDE.  THE SHIPS AND GFDL INTENSITY GUIDANCE BRINGS FLOYD
TO CLOSE TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS IN THREE DAYS.  THE AVN DEVELOPS
AN UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE NORTH OF FLOYD DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD
THAT SHOULD PROVIDE A LONGER TERM ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE FOR
STRENGTHENING.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/9.  A SYNOPTIC SURVEILLANCE MISSION BY THE
NOAA JET LAST NIGHT SHOWS A SLIGHT WEAKNESS IN THE 500 MB RIDGE TO
THE NORTH OF FLOYD AND THIS HAS LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE
IN FORWARD SPEED COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.  THE NCEP CLOBAL MODEL AT
06Z CONTINUES TO ANALYZE AN UNREALISTIC-LOOKING RING OF VORTICITY
SURROUNDING FLOYD...WHICH APPEARS TO INDUCE A NORTHWARD TRACK
DEFLECTION IN THE MODEL FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM.  THIS IS
DISCOUNTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH CALLS FOR A WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK FOR 48 HOURS.  BEYOND THAT...THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER
THE EASTERN U.S. IS FORECAST TO LIFT OUT...LEAVING A CUTOFF LOW IN
THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND STRONG RIDGING NORTH OF THE CYCLONE. 
IF THIS SCENARIO VERIFIES...A MORE WESTWARD TRACK IS LIKELY AT 72
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS

SATELLITE IMAGERY AND DATA FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT THIS AFTERNOON INDICATE THAT FLOYD IS NOW
BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED.  AN EYE APPEARED BRIEFLY THIS
AFTERNOON...AND FOR THE FIRST TIME...THE FIX FROM THE AIRCRAFT
PLACED THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION AND
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SATELLITE IMAGERY.  ALTHOUGH THE WINDS
HAVE NOT INCREASED AT THIS TIME...THE MSLP REPORTED BY DROPSONDE WAS
977 MB...12 MB LOWER THAN 6 HOURS AGO.  THE MOST RECENT PASS THROUGH
THE CENTER SUGGESTS THAT THE PRESSURE HAS DROPPED ANOTHER MB OR TWO.
IN MANY STORMS PRESSURE FALLS PRECEDE WIND INCREASES...AND WE EXPECT
THE WINDS TO CATCH UP TO THE IMPROVED STRUCTURE SOON.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL BRINGS FLOYD TO CATEGORY THREE ON THE
SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE IN 72 HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONCURS.

THE SHORT-TERM MOTION OF THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER HAS BEEN TO THE NORTH-
NORTHWEST...BUT THIS IS DUE LARGELY TO THE CHANGES IN STORM
STRUCTURE.  A MORE REPRESENTATIVE MOTION IS 310/10.  ALL THE
GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON A NORTHWEST MOTION FOR THE NEXT DAY

AND DROPSONDE MEASURED WINDS OF 99 KNOTS AT 925 MB.  THE CREW ALSO
REPORTED A GOOD RADAR PRESENTATION AND A CENTER REFORMING INSIDE THE
ORIGINAL CENTER.  BASED ON RECON AND THE AVERAGE WIND ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB SAB AND KGWC....THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS ADJUSTED TO 80 KNOTS
AT THIS TIME.  FLOYD IS WELL ORGANIZED WITH AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND
VERY DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  HOWEVER...THE HURRICANE HAS
TO MOVE THROUGH THE MID-UPPER OCEANIC TROUGH....CLEARLY OBSERVED ON
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY... DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THIS FEATURE
IS ALSO DEPICTED BY RAOBS FROM THE CARIBBEAN WHICH REPORTED
SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS...AT 300 MB BLOWING INTO THE HURRICANE.  IN
ADDITION...THE AVN DEVELOPS A 200 MB NORTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS...RESULTING IN A SHEARING
ENVIRONMENT.   THEREFORE...SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE LIKELY
DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...ONCE FLOYD MOVES AWAY
FROM THE UPPER-TROUGH...STRENGTHENING SHOULD START AGAIN.

INITIAL MOTION IS 310/10.  UNANIMOUSLY...DYNAMICAL MODELS TURN THE
HURRICANE ON A TRACK MORE TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND EVEN WESTWARD.
THIS DEVIATION TO THE LEFT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT A STRONG WARM
RIDGE...WHICH IS VERY STRONG AT MID TO UPPER-LEVELS OVER THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC AND THE LACK OF TROUGH IN THE FORECAST ALONG EAST COAST OF
THE UNITED STATES.  THE RELIABLE UK MODEL IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE IN
TURNING THE HURRICANE WESTWARD AND LOCATES FLOYD NEAR THE CENTRAL
BAHAMAS IN THREE DAYS AND VERY NEAR CENTRAL FLORIDA IN FIVE DAYS. 
NEVERTHELESS...THE CURRENT TREND OF ALL THE LONG RANGE MODELS IS A
TRACK TOWARD THE U.S. EAST COAST INSTEAD OF A NORTHWARD TURN OVER
OPEN WATERS.  THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

GIVEN THESE TRENDS...RESIDENTS ALONG THE U.S EAST COAST SHOULD

THE LATEST REPORT RELAYED FROM THE AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE PRESSURE HAS CONTINUED TO FALL THIS
MORNING AND THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE IS NOW 963 MB...A 31 MB
DROP DURING THE LAST 24 HRS.  THEY ALSO REPORTED A 25 NMI CIRCULAR
EYE...OPEN TO THE SOUTH.  MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 107 KTS
WERE RECORDED IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THUS...THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS RAISED TO 90 KTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE OVERALL CLOUD
PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH FLOYD REMAINS HEALTHY WITH VERY DEEP
CONVECTION PERSISTING AROUND THE CENTER...TOPS TO -70 TO -80C.
HOWEVER...THE OUTFLOW IS BEING DISRUPTED SOMEWHAT OVER THE SOUTHERN
SEMICIRCLE OF THE HURRICANE BY THE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE EASTERN
CARIBBEAN.  THE HURRICANE WILL BE MOVING THROUGH THE MID TO UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH...SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY TO THE WEST OF THE
CYCLONE...DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HRS. THIS COUPLED WITH NORTHWESTERLY
SHEAR...DEPICTED IN THE AVIATION MODEL AND REFLECTED IN THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST...WILL LIKELY CAUSE SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY THROUGH 36 HRS.  THEREAFTER...CONDITIONS SHOULD BECOME
FAVORABLE FOR ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
BRINGS FLOYD TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS BY 72 HRS. 

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/09 KTS. THE FUTURE MOTION OF
FLOYD WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE
MID-LEVEL TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL LIFT OUT
DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HRS WITH THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWING A
RIDGE BUILDING WESTWARD INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. BY 48 HRS.
ALL OF THE DYNAMIC-BASED TRACK GUIDANCE REMAINS TIGHTLY CLUSTERED 
ON A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION BETWEEN 24 AND 48 HRS WITH A MORE
WESTWARD HEADING THEREAFTER. THE UKMET REMAINS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE
MODEL WITH REGARDS TO THE WESTWARD MOTION. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK BENDS FLOYD BACK TO A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING AFTER 
12 HRS...WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST BY 48 HR.  THIS TRACK IS
VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
BEYOND 72 HRS...THE FORECAST UNCERTAINTY INCREASES CONSIDERABLY
AS THE NEXT MID-LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES THE EASTERN U.S. AND
WEAKENS THE RIDGE. THE UKMET MODEL TURNS THE HURRICANE BACK TO
THE NORTHWEST JUST OFF THE FLORIDA COAST IN FOUR DAYS AND ENDS UP
OFF THE GEORGIA COAST IN FIVE DAYS. NOGAPS IS SIMILAR ALTHOUGH IT
MAKES THE TURN BACK TO THE NORTHWEST EAST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS.
ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY

THE PREVIOUS MOTION.  THE FUTURE MOTION OF FLOYD DEPENDS ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC
DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS A BIT LESS TIGHTLY
CLUSTERED THAN EARLIER...WITH THE LBAR AND GFDL SHOWING LESS OF A
WESTWARD TURN.  THE FIVE DAY GFDL TURNS THE HURRICANE TO THE
NORTHWEST...BRINGING FLOYD TO THE CAROLINAS IN FIVE DAYS.  THE MRF
LAST NIGHT...ON THE OTHER HAND...TAKES FLOYD INTO SOUTH FLORIDA. 
THIS ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFICULTY OF SPECIFYING LANDFALL BEYOND THREE
DAYS TIME.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY BUT WITH A SLIGHTLY SLOWER SPEED AT THE END OF THE PERIOD
DUE TO AN ANTICIPATED WEAKENING OF THE STEERING CURRENTS.

HURRICANE FLOYD DISCUSSION NUMBER  17
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SAT SEP 11 1999
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON SHOWS THE REEMERGENCE OF AN
EYE...INDICATING THAT FLOYD IS GETTING BETTER ORGANIZED. 
HOWEVER...THE MOST RECENT RECONNAISSANCE DATA DO NOT SHOW ANY
INCREASE IN STRENGTH YET.  THE OUTFLOW IS IMPROVING SOMEWHAT AS THE
SMALL UPPER LOW NOTED EARLIER HAS ROTATED SOUTHWEST OF THE
HURRICANE.  THIS SHOULD BE A MORE FAVORABLE CONFIGURATION AND FLOYD
SHOULD REACH MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS TONIGHT OR TOMORROW.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/10...AGAIN A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS MOTION.  THE PAST FEW VISIBLE IMAGES SHOW A DUE WEST MOTION
BUT I EXPECT THIS TO BE A TEMPORARY JOG.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE HURRICANE...AS
FORECAST OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS SHOULD KEEP FLOYD ON A
GENERALLY WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS OR SO.  BEYOND
THAT...THE 00Z MRF AND 12Z AVN BRING THE HURRICANE TO THE SOUTH
FLORIDA COAST...WHILE THE UKMET HAS DONE AN ABOUT FACE AND RECURVES
FLOYD WITHOUT MAKING LANDFALL AT ALL.  IT IS CLEARLY TOO SOON TO
SPECIFY WHAT PORTION OF THE COAST IS AT GREATEST RISK FOR
LANDFALL...BUT ALL INTERESTS FROM FLORIDA THROUGH THE CAROLINAS
SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS HURRICANE. THE TRACK
WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE DEVELOPING
RIDGE AND THE APPROACHING MID-LATITUDE TROUGH NOW OVER THE WESTERN
U.S.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND HAS LESS OF A LEFTWARD BEND AT THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD.

AS EXPECTED...FLOYD IS INTERACTING WITH A MIDDLE-LEVEL TROUGH...AND
CONSEQUENTLY...THE CLOUD PATTERN AND THE INNER CORE ARE DISRUPTED. 
MINIMUM PRESSURE HAS LEVELED OFF AT 967 MB AND MAX WINDS REMAIN 95
KNOTS OR MAYBE LOWER AT THIS TIME.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY
ARE LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS WHILE FLOYD IS INTERACTING
WITH THE UPPER-TROUGH.  THEREAFTER...GLOBAL MODELS... PRIMARILY THE
AVN...ARE DEVELOPING UPPER-LEVEL WINDS WHICH ARE VERY FAVORABLE FOR
STRENTHENING.  THIS IS ALSO INDICATED BY SHIPS AND THE GFDL...WHICH
IN FACT LOWER THE PRESSURE TO ABOUT 920 MB.

FIXES FROM THE RECON EARLIER TODAY...INDICATE A SHORT TERM WESTERLY
TRACK...BUT OVERALL..THE LONGER TREND MOTION HAS BEEN 285/10. 
MODELS HAVE NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY TONIGHT...AND THEY ARE EVEN
MORE TIGHTLY-PACKED AND...ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY...MOVE THE HURRICANE ON
A GENERAL WEST NORTHWEST TRACK.  THESE MODELS BRING THE HURRICANE TO
A POSITION DANGEROULSY CLOSE TO THE CENTRAL COAST OF FLORIDA.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ENSEMBLE. 

THERE ARE INDICATIONS FROM OTHER LONGER RANGE MODELS...UK AND

5 AM EDT SUN SEP 12 1999
 
THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER RECENTLY REPORTED A MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 960 MB AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 95 KT.
THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVER THE LAST 24 HRS AS
FLOYD HAS INTERACTED WITH THE MID-LEVEL TROUGH TO ITS WEST.
SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT CONDITIONS SEEM TO BE IMPROVING 
AND FLOYD MAY BEGIN TO STRENGTHEN LATER THIS MORNING.  NCEP GLOBAL
MODELS SHOW A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR STRENGTHENING...AND FORECAST
BRINGS FLOYD TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS BY 12 HRS.

THE LATEST RECONNAISSANCE FIXES SHOW A GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION OVER
THE LAST 6 HRS OR SO...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW
275/11. THE SYNOPTIC DATA GATHERED BY THE NOAA P-3 AIRCRAFT WAS
INCORPORATED INTO THE 00Z INITIALIZATION OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODELS.
THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE SHOULD KEEP IT ON A
GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH 24 HRS.  AFTER 24 HRS...A TROUGH WILL
MOVE INTO THE EASTERN U.S. AND WEAKEN THE RIDGE. ALL OF THE
OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH A GENERAL WEST...
THEN WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 36 HRS. THEREAFTER...THERE IS
SOME SCATTER WITH NOGAPS THE RIGHT-MOST OF THE DYNAMIC MODELS WHILE
THE AVIATION BRINGS THE HURRICANE TO THE FLORIDA COAST BETWEEN PALM
BEACH AND DAYTONA BEACH....AS DOES BAMD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS
THE HURRICANE JUST OFFSHORE OF THE FLORIDA COAST AND IS VERY SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 

BASED ON THE FORECAST TRACK...THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BAHAMAS HAS
ISSUED A TROPICAL STORM WARNING FOR THE SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS AND THE
TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS...AND A HURRICANE WATCH FOR THE CENTRAL
BAHAMAS.  A HURRICANE WATCH WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED FOR THE
NORTHWEST BAHAMAS LATER TODAY. 
 
THERE ARE INDICATIONS FROM THE LONGER RANGE MODELS...UKMET AND
NOGAPS...THAT BEYOND 72 HOURS...THE HURRICANE COULD TURN TO THE

THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT EARLY THIS MORNING
REPORTED A MINIMUM  CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 955 MB AND MAXIMUM
FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 120 KT.  THIS SUPPORTS A SURFACE WIND OF 105
KT...MAKING FLOYD A CATEGORY THREE ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON HURRICANE
SCALE.  SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING SHOWS THAT FLOYD NOW HAS GOOD
OUTFLOW IN ALL QUADRANTS.  WARM WATER AND RELATIVELY LIGHT SHEAR LIE
AHEAD OF THE HURRICANE AND FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY.   

THE EYE HAS BEEN WOBBLING ABOUT THIS MORNING AND APPEARS TO HAVE
COMPLETED A CYCLONIC LOOP OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THE INITIAL
MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 275/10...ABOUT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS TIGHTLY CLUSTERED ON A WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK OVER THE NEXT 36 HOURS.  BEYOND THAT...THE MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE
IS FORECAST TO WEAKEN AS A MAJOR MID-LATITUDE TROUGH OVER THE U.S.
APPROACHES.  THE CENTER OF THE HURRICANE IS EXPECTED TO BE VERY
CLOSE TO THE FLORIDA COAST IN 72 HOURS...BUT WHETHER FLOYD WILL BE
MOVING WESTWARD OR NORTHWARD AT THAT TIME IS VERY UNCERTAIN.
 
THE HURRICANE WATCH...NOW IN EFFECT FOR THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS...WILL
PROBABLY NEED TO BE EXTENDED TO THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS THIS AFTERNOON
OR TONIGHT.  BASED ON THE FORECAST TRACK...NO WATCHES FOR THE U.S.
COAST ARE LIKELY TO BE REQUIRED TODAY.  THERE ARE INDICATIONS FROM
THE LONGER RANGE MODELS...UKMET AND NOGAPS...THAT BEYOND 72
HOURS...THE HURRICANE COULD TURN TO THE  NORTH ON A TRACK

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT THIS AFTERNOON
REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 940 MB...WHICH REPRESENTS A
DROP OF 20 MB IN ABOUT 12 HOURS.  THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS
WERE 125 KT.  THE SURFACE WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 110 KT AT THIS
TIME...AND GIVEN THE PRESSURE FALLS...IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE FLOYD BECOMES A CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 280/12...A LITTLE FASTER THAN
EARLIER.  THERE IS LITTLE NEW MODEL GUIDANCE AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS ESSENTIALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  A MID-
LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE WILL KEEP FLOYD ON A WEST TO WEST-

UKMET...AND THE GFDL RUN OFF THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL SHOWS FLOYD
REMAINING OFF THE COAST.

WIND RADII HAVE BEEN EXPANDED BASED ON A SURFACE ANALYSIS PROVIDED
BY THE NOAA HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION.  BASED ON THESE RADII AND

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 931 MB.  BASED ON THE FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS
AT 700 MB AND DROPSONDE DATA THE MAXIMUM ONE-MINUTE SURFACE WINDS
ARE INCREASED TO 125 KT.  THIS MAKES FLOYD A CATEGORY FOUR

FLOYD IS EXPECTED TO BE STEERED AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A MID
TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN ATLANTIC...WHICH
IS DEPICTED WELL BY THE JUST-COMPLETED SYNOPTIC SURVEILLANCE MISSION
WITH THE NOAA JET.  THESE DATA SHOW THE CENTER OF THE ANTICYCLONE

FLOYD HAS CONTINUED TO INTENSIFY THIS MORNING WITH THE LATEST AIR
FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT REPORTING A MINIMUM CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 922 MB...A 39 MB DROP OVER THE LAST 24 HRS. THE MAXIMUM
FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND...700 MB...WAS 146 KTS IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT
WHILE DROPSONDE DATA SHOW A MAXIMUM WIND OF 168 KTS. THUS...THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 135 KTS FOR THIS ADVISORY WHICH
MAKES FLOYD A STRONG CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE.
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY DEPICTS A CLASSIC HURRICANE WITH AN EXTREMELY
WELL-DEFINED EYE AND THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW IS IMPRESSIVE.
THERE HAS BEEN AN EROSION OF THE COLD CLOUD TOPS OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE OF FLOYD. HOWEVER...THIS MAY BE A TEMPORARY CONDITION.
SST ANALYSES FROM JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY INDICATE THAT FLOYD IS
TRAVERSING A WARM EDDY...ABOUT 32C.  THERE WILL LIKELY BE SOME
FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HRS...MAINLY DUE 
TO EYE-WALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 280/12. THE SYNOPTIC REASONING
BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS UNCHANGED WITH FLOYD BEING
STEERING BY THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE OVER THE EXTREME
WESTERN ATLANTIC...AS DEPICTED BY THE NOAA P-3 AND G-IV SYNOPTIC
SURVEILLANCE MISSION DATA. THE 00Z OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE SHOWS A
TIGHTER CLUSTERING AROUND A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH
36 HRS...LIKELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NOAA DATA.  THEREAFTER...THE
GUIDANCE BECOMES MORE DIVERGENT WITH THE BAM MODELS TRACKING FLOYD
INTO PALM BEACH FLORIDA...THE AVIATION NEAR JACKSONVILLE...WHILE 
THE GLOBAL MODELS AND THE GFDL TURN THE SYSTEM NORTHWARD OVER THE
NORTHWEST BAHAMAS AND INDICATE LANDFALL IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY OWNING TO THE CONTINUED WESTERLY MOTION. BASED 
ON THIS TRACK...A HURRICANE WATCH IS BEING ISSUED FOR THE FLORIDA
EAST COAST FROM SOUTH OF FLAGLER BEACH TO HALLANDALE. THE GOVERNMENT
OF THE BAHAMAS IS ISSUING A HURRICANE WARNING FOR THE NORTHWEST

LAST RECONNAISSANCE REPORTS INDICATE THE CENTRAL PRESSURE CHANGING
LITTLE SO INTENSITY APPEARS TO BE HOLDING ABOUT STEADY.  FLOYD HAS A
FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL APPEARANCE WITH GOOD OUTFLOW OVER ALL BY THE
SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  A GPS DROPWINDSONDE RECENTLY MEASURED 152 KNOTS
ABOVE THE SURFACE TO THE NORTH OF THE CENTER.  NOT MUCH CHANGE IN
STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  LATER IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD...SOME WEAKENING MAY OCCUR AS THE HURRICANE ENTERS A
LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.
 
AFTER THE INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED NOTED EARLIER TODAY...THE MOTION
IS BACK TO AROUND 12 KNOTS.  SATELLITE AND AIRCRAFT FIXES SHOWED A
SLIGHT NORTHWESTWARD WOBBLE A FEW HOURS AGO...BUT THE HEADING IS
BACK TO 280 DEGREES NOW.  THE TRACK FORECAST REASONING REMAINS THE
SAME.  A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHING THE EASTERN STATES
IS LIKELY TO ERODE THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH WHICH HAS BEEN
STEERING FLOYD WESTWARD.  THIS SHOULD CREATE MORE OF A NORTHWARD
STEERING CURRENT...AND FLOYD IS EXPECTED TO TURN NORTHWESTWARD
DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.   THIS WHAT HAS BEEN SHOWN BY MOST

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT TUE SEP 14 1999
 
RECENT FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT
INDICATE THAT THE ANTICIPATED WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION HAS BEGUN...
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 290/12 KTS.  SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOWS A NNW-SSE ELONGATION OF THE STORM ENVELOPE INDICATING
THAT FLOYD IS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THE APPROACHING MID-
UPPER LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH. THE TRACK FORECAST REASONING
REMAINS UNCHANGED AS THE MID TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHING THE
EASTERN U.S. WILL LIKELY ERODE THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH
WHICH HAS BEEN STEERING FLOYD WESTWARD.  THIS SHOULD CREATE MORE 
OF A NORTHWARD STEERING CURRENT...AND FLOYD IS EXPECTED TO TURN
NORTHWESTWARD DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A NORTHWARD
HEADING THROUGH 48 HRS.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS ARE IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO...AND IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST. THE NHC TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

THE LATEST MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE FROM THE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT
IS 928 MB...A 5 MB RISE OVER THE LAST 24 HRS. THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT-
LEVEL WINDS WERE 119 KTS WHILE THE GPS DROPSONDE RECORDED A MAXIMUM
OF 133 KTS.  RECON DATA SHOWS A DOUBLE WIND MAX STRUCTURE SUGGESTING
THAT A CONCENTRIC EYEWALL CYCLE MAY BE UNDERWAY.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 135 KTS.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT
THE HURRICANE REMAINS VERY SYMMETRIC AND GOOD OUTFLOW PERSISTS IN
ALL BUT THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT. ALTHOUGH SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY ARE LIKELY...LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS EXPECTED DURING
THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THEREAFTER...THE NCEP GLOBAL MODELS ALONG WITH
THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL INDICATE THAT THE UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE WILL
MOVE EAST RESULTING IN SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR OVER FLOYD
WHICH SHOULD GRADUALLY WEAKEN THE HURRICANE.  THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE LAST FORECAST PACKAGE AND THE SHIPS INTENSITY SCHEME...
ALTHOUGH NOT AS DRAMATIC.   

AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BAHAMAS...THE TROPICAL
STORM WARNING FOR THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS IS DISCONTINUED.  THE
WARNING FOR THE SOUTHEASTERN BAHAMAS WILL LIKELY BE LOWERED LATER
THIS MORNING.

REGARDLESS OF THE WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION...HURRICANE FLOYD WILL STILL
COME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE EAST FLORIDA COAST.  ALL PREPARATIONS
SHOULD BE RUSHED TO COMPLETION IN THE WARNING AREA.

STEERING CURRENT AND EVENTUALLY A NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD FLOW...ON THE
EAST SIDE OF A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES.

THE MOST RECENT DATA RELAYED FROM AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE INDICATES
THE EYE IS ELLIPTICAL...A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 935 MB AND A
MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND OF 134 KT...WHICH SUPPORTS MAINTAINING THE
INITIAL INTENSITY OF 120 KT. THE LATEST RADAR AND SATELLITE IMAGERY
SUGGESTS THAT A NEW EYEWALL MAY BE FORMING. FLUCTUATIONS IN STRENGTH
ARE LIKELY...BUT SINCE FLOYD IS LIKELY TO CROSS PORTIONS OF THE GULF
STREAM DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO IT SHOULD MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT
INTENSITY PRIOR TO LANDFALL.
 
THE LATEST RECON FIXES SHOW THAT FLOYD IS NOW MOVING NORTH-
NORTHWESTWARD AND IS MOVING A BIT FASTER...WITH THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE NOW 335/13 KT.  THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN U.S. WILL IMPART A MORE NORTHERLY HEADING LATER TODAY.
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY MOVING SOUTHWARD 
OVER THE NORTH PLAINS WILL TURN...AND ACCELERATE...THE HURRICANE
ON A MORE NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD...THEN NORTHEAST TRACK BY 36 HRS. 
THUS THE NHC FORECAST SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH AND NORTH-
NORTHEAST...THEN NORTHEAST BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE NOGAPS...BUT A LITTLE
FASTER...AND IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE.  

BASED ON THE NEW FORECAST TRACK...AND COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL
NWS OFFICES...A TROPICAL STORM WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FROM
CHINCOTEAGUE VIRGINIA TO CAPE HENLOPEN DELWARE.  

THE NOAA BUOY 41010 REACHED A PEAK WIND OF 70 KT...WITH GUSTS TO 85
KT...AND SEAS TO 54 FT.  THE WINDS ARE PROBABLY LOW GIVEN THE HIGH
SEA STATES. THE BUOY IS NOW IN THE EYE AND THE PRESSURE IS 938.8 MB.

SUSTAINED WITH GUSTS TO 52 KT.  WIND DATA FROM THE NWS MELBOURNE
WSR-WIND 88D RADAR INDICATES 64 KT WINDS AOB 1500 FT.  THE HURRICANE
WARNINGS WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED FOR THE FLORIDA EAST COAST.

THE NOAA BUOY AT GRAYS REEF OFF THE GEORGIA IS ALREADY REPORTING
SUSTAINED TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS WHILE NOAA BUOY 41004 NEAR

FLOYD IS NOW INLAND OVER EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA AND THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS 030/19 KT...BASED ON RECON FIXES FROM THE AIR
FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT AND RADAR FIXES FROM THE 
NWS WILMINGTON WSR-88D RADAR.  THE HURRICANE SHOULD ACCELERATE AS 
IT IS STEERED ON A NORTH-NORTHEAST...THEN NORTHEAST TRACK FOR THE 
NEXT 24-36 HOURS BY THE SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH.  THE SYSTEM SHOULD TURN TO A MORE EAST-
NORTHEAST HEADING BEYOND 36 HOURS.   THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK 
IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND
IS IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE. 
THIS TRACK TAKES THE CENTER INLAND OVER EXTREME EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA DURING THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS AND REEMERGES OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC WITH A POSITION JUST OFF THE EASTERN TIP OF LONG
ISLAND NEW YORK BY 24 HRS.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONE MUST
NOT FOCUS ON THIS EXACT TRACK BECAUSE FLOYD WILL RETAIN A LARGE 
CORE OF STRONG WINDS.

THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA DOPPLER-ON-WHEELS (DOW) TEAM RECORDED A
MAX SUSTAINED WIND OF 81 MPH...AND A PEAK GUST OF 123 MPH...AT
TOPSAIL BEACH NORTH CAROLINA NEAR THE TIME FLOYD MADE LANDFALL.  THE

INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 90 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY. ADDITIONAL
WEAKENING IS LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 6-12 HRS AS FLOYD MOVES ACROSS
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA.  THEREAFTER FLOYD IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN A
CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE AS IT PASSES JUST EAST OF LONG ISLAND NEW YORK.

TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND THEN EAST OVER THE NEXT 3 DAYS...MOVING
ALONG THE NORTHEAST U.S COAST AND THEN THE CANADIAN MARITIME
PROVINCES.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO...AND AN UPDATE
OF...THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST.
 
THE STRONGEST SURFACE WIND REPORTED AT 12Z WAS 67 KNOTS SUSTAINED AT

WAKEFIELD DOPPLER DOPPLER WINDS ARE 64 TO 75 KNOTS AT 2000 FT.  SO
THE MAXIMUM SURFACE WIND IS ESTIMATED AT 70 KNOTS AT 15Z AND FLOYD
IS FORECAST TO DROP BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH WITH 60 KNOTS IN 12
HOURS.  THIS IS BASED ON FOLLOWING THE CURRENT WEAKENING TREND. 
MOST OF THE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS
SHOULD BE OFFSHORE OR RIGHT ON THE COAST...BUT NOT VERY FAR
INLAND...IF AT ALL.  EVEN THOUGH THE WINDS ARE FORECAST TO DROP
BELOW HURRICANE FORCE IN 12 HOURS...THE HURRICANE WARNINGS WILL NOT
BE CHANGED AT THIS TIME...DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN INTENSITY

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT THU SEP 16 1999
CORRECTION...TROPICAL STORM FLOYD...NOT SUBTROPICAL
 
AN AIR FORCE RECON PLANE FIXED THE CENTER ON THE COAST AT THE MD/DEL
BORDER AT 1851Z.  THIS GIVES AN INITIAL MOTION 0F 025/26 AND IS A
LITTLE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...SO THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.  OTHERWISE THE
FORECAST CONTINIUES TO SHOW AN ACCELERATION TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND
EAST FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS...FOLLOWING A CONSENSUS OF THE MODEL
GUIDANCE.
 
THE AIRCRAFT MEASURED 70 TO 80 KNOTS AT 700 MB OVER THE
ATLANTIC...BUT A GPS DROP MEASURED ONLY 35 TO 40 KNOTS AT THE
SURFACE.  THE LAST SURFACE EVIDENCE OF HURRICANE WINDS WAS THE DUCK
PIER C-MAN AT 14Z.  THERE ARE SOME DOPPLER RADAR WINDS OF HURRICANE
FORCE OF THE DELMARVA PENINSULA...BUT THE SURFACE WINDS ARE BELIEVED
TO BE MUCH LESS.  SO FLOYD IS DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM AT 21Z
AND THE WARNINGS ALONG THE NORTHEAST U.S. COAST ARE ALSO DOWNGRADED
TO TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS.
 
THE MAIN THREAT NOW SHIFTS TO HEAVY RAINFALL AND VERY SERIOUS INLAND
FLOODING.

THE SYSTEM IS STARTING TO LOOK NON-TROPICAL...WITH AN ASYMMETRICAL
APPEARANCE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY. AND STRONG WINDS WELL AWAY FROM THE
CENTER.  FLOYD IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL IN 12 HOURS OR
SO.

THE STORM IS ACCELERATING AND INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 040/30. 
OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE SHOWS AN EASTWARD BEND WITH TIME WHICH IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE MORE ZONALLY-ORIENTED STEERING FLOW BETWEEN 45N-
50N.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS MORE OR LESS ALONG THE SAME
TRAJECTORY AS THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT A LITTLE FASTER BECAUSE OF THE
INCREASED INITIAL SPEED OF MOTION.

THERE IS STILL SOME THREAT FROM HEAVY RAINS BUT SINCE FLOYD IS NOW
MOVING SO SWIFTLY...IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DROP MUCH ADDITIONAL RAIN
IN ANY ONE PLACE.

TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE MAINTAINED AROUND THE NEW ENGLAND AREA
AT THIS TIME.  FARTHER NORTH...SINCE THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE
EXTRATROPICAL VERY SOON...GALE WARNINGS ARE ISSUED.

THE CENTER OF FLOYD IS BECOMING DIFFICULT TO LOCATE USING EITHER
RADAR DATA OR SATELLITE IMAGERY. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT
FLOYD HAS SLOWED SOMEWHAT...AND THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOW 035/23 KT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS AN
INITIAL NORTHEAST MOTION FOLLOWED BY A EAST-NORTHEAST TRACK AFTER 
12 HRS...WITH AN EASTWARD BEND BY 36 HRS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH
THE MORE ZONALLY-ORIENTED STEERING FLOW BETWEEN 45N-50N.  THE
CURRENT NHC FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...
BUT A TAD SLOWER DUE TO THE INITIAL FORWARD SPEED.
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY AND SURFACE DATA SHOWS THAT FLOYD CONTINUES
ITS TRANSITION TO AN EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE.  THE STRONGEST WINDS
REMAIN WELL REMOVED FROM THE CENTER....MAINLY TO THE SOUTH AND 
EAST. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT THE CENTER HAS BECOME
ELONGATED. FLOYD IS FORECAST TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL IN 12 HOURS.

AFTER COORDINATION WITH THE NWS OFFICES IN UPTON NY AND TAUNTON MA
...THE TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS FROM SANDY HOOK NEW JERSEY TO
MERRIMACK MASSACHUSETTS WILL BE DISCONTINUED.

THIS WILL BE THE LAST ADVISORY ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL HURRICANE
CENTER ON FLOYD.  FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS SYSTEM CAN BE FOUND 
IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC HIGH SEAS FORECAST PRODUCT ISSUED BY THE
MARINE PREDICTION CENTER IN WASHINGTON D.C. UNDER AFOS HEADER
NFDHSFAT1 AND WMO HEADER FZNT01 KWBC.

SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING INDICATES THAT THE STRONG TROPICAL
WAVE SOUTH OF THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND
IS NOW TROPICAL DEPRESSION NINE.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB AND SAB ARE 30 AND 25 KT RESPECTIVELY...AND THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY IS SET TO 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE LARGE DEPRESSION
HAS GOOD BANDING BUT NOT MUCH CONVECTION NEAR ITS POORLY DEFINED
CENTER.  OUTFLOW IS CURRENTLY RESTRICTED ON THE EAST SIDE DUE TO
SOME MODEST EASTERLY SHEAR...BUT THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL FORECASTS
THE SHEAR TO BE LOW AND BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO HURRICANE STRENGH
WITHIN 48 HOURS.
 
INITIAL LOCATION IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE ILL-DEFINED CENTER...BUT
THE MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 280/16.  GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A SWIFT
WEST TO WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE LBAR AND MEDIUM BAM.

QUADRANT.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS SET AT 60 KNOTS AND STRENGTHENING IS
PREDICTED...AS IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THIS IS ALSO IN REASONABLE
AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS.

BASED ON RECENT CENTER FIXES...THE MOTION CONTINUES TOWARD THE WEST
AT JUST A SLIGHTLY SLOWER FORWARD SPEED...17 KNOTS.  THE TRACK
FORECAST PHILOSOPHY IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED.  A MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE IS LIKELY TO PERSIST TO THE NORTH OF GERT FOR THE NEXT FEW

STRENGTH. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM SAB...TAFB...AND AFWA
ARE 65 KT...55 KT...AND 55 KT RESPECTIVELY. A WARM SPOT IS PRESENT
NEAR THE CENTER...BUT IS NOT YET GOOD ENOUGH LOOKING TO CALL AN EYE.
THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS REMAIN AT 60 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 275/17. THE SYNOPTIC SITUATION IS

INTO TWO CAMPS...WITH THE UKMET...BAMM...BAMS...AVN...AND CLIPER
BEING FASTER AND A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH. THE GFDL...BAMD...AND LBAR
ARE SLOWER AND FURTHER SOUTH. THE FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THE FIRST
GROUP AND IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

GERT HAS STRONG CONVECTION AND GOOD OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE. FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY ALONG THE LINES OF THE
SHIPS MODEL...WITH THE SYSTEM BECOMING A HURRICANE LATER TODAY AND
NEAR MAJOR HURRICANE INTENSITY BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
ONE POSSIBLE INHIBITING FACTOR IS THAT THE AVN AND NOGAPS DEVELOP A
STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN TROPICAL
ATLANTIC THAT COULD CREATE NORTHERLY SHEAR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST
IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BASED ON THE PREMISES THAT GERT
IS LIKELY TO BECOME A HURRICANE BEFORE THIS HAPPENS...AND COULD WELL

5 PM EDT MON SEP 13 1999
 
SATELLITE LOOPS DURING THE DAY INDICATE THAT GERT CONTINUES TO
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND IN FACT AN EYE FEATURE APPARENT ON
VISIBLE IMAGES. T-NUMBERS FROM SAB AND TAFB ARE 4.5 ON THE DVORAK
SCALE.THEREFORE..THE WINDS HAVE BEEN INCREASED TO 75 KNOTS.
 
SHIPS...BRINGS GERT TO 104 KNOTS WHILE THE GFDL CONTINUES TO LOWER
THE PRESSURE TO NEAR 940 MB BY 72 HOURS. THESE MODELS HAVE BEEN
PERFORMING VERY WELL IN FORECASTING INTENSITY TRENDS SO FAR THIS
YEAR.  THEREFORE...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS GERT TO 105 KNOTS IN
3 DAYS.
 
GERT IS NOW MOVING 270/16.  THERE IS A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO
THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE WHICH IS FORECAST TO PERSIST AND EVEN
STRENGTHEN. THEREFORE A CONTINUED WESTWARD TRACK IS EXPECTED THROUGH
72 HOURS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH TRACK MODELS..INCLUDING THE GFDL
WHICH MOVES GERT SOUTH OF DUE WEST FOR A PERIOD OF 24 TO 36 HOURS.
LONGER RANGE MODELS PUT THE HURRICANE VERY NEAR OR OVER THE NORTHERN
LEEWARD ISLANDS IN ABOUT 4 DAYS.  HOWEVER...THESE FORECASTS ARE
HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON SEP 13 1999
 
SATELLITE LOOPS DURING THE EVENING SHOWED A BURSTING PATTERN
BEGINNING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE EYE WITH THE CIRRUS SPREADING OUT
OVER THE EYE...OBSCURING IT.  SATELLITE T-NUMBERS REMAIN THE SAME AS
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...4.5 FROM BOTH MIAMI AND SAB.  THEREFORE..THE
WINDS REMAIN AT 75 KNOTS.
 
SHIPS...NOW SEES A SOMEWHAT MORE HOSTILE UPPER LEVEL ENVIRONMENT AT
48 HOURS AND BEYOND AND NOW INTENSIFIES GERT TO ONLY 99 KNOTS. 
SINCE THE GFDL MODEL STILL WANTS TO INTENSIFY THE SYSTEM TO OVER 100
KNOTS THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.
 
BECAUSE OF THE BURSTING PATTERN THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE
INITIAL POSITION AND IT APPEARS THAT THE SYSTEM HAS SLOWED.  THE
INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 280/14. A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF
THE HURRICANE CONTINUES TO GUIDE THE SYSTEM TOWARD THE WEST. 
THEREFORE A CONTINUED WESTWARD TRACK IS EXPECTED THROUGH 72 HOURS.
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TRACK MODELS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT GERT HAS ONCE AGAIN DEVELOPED
AN EYE. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 90
KT...WHICH WILL BE THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY.

NOW THAT THE EYE HAS RE-FORMED...THE INITIAL MOTION IS LESS
UNCERTAIN AND IS ESTIMATED TO BE 285/13. THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN IS
UNCHANGED FROM 24 HOURS AGO...WITH GERT CONTINUING WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWEST UNDER THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. SEVERAL HURRICANE GUIDANCE
MODELS...MOST NOTABLY THE NOGAPS AND THE BAMM...HAVE A TURN TOWARD
THE NORTHWEST DUE TO A WEAKENING RIDGE NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. SOME OF THIS WEAKENING APPEARS DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF
HURRICANE FLOYD IN THE MODELS...WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT
IMPLIES. THUS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED ONLY SLIGHTLY
NORTHWARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. WHILE THE 72 HOUR POINT IS
NORTH OF THE LESSER ANTILLES...GERT COULD STILL BE A THREAT TO THAT
AREA IF THE STORM MOVES MORE TO THE WEST THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.

THE SHIPS MODEL WANTS TO DEVELOP 20-25 KT VERTICAL WIND SHEAR OVER
GERT BY 36-48 HOURS...AND THUS ONLY INTENSIFIES IT TO 105 KT. A LOOK
AT THE AVN AND NOGAPS 200 MB WIND FIELDS DOES NOT INDICATE THAT
STRONG OF SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM. THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS THUS A
LITTLE STRONG THAN BOTH SHIPS AND THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE LONGER RANGE FORECAST OF GERT IS STILL UNCERTAIN. SEVERAL OF THE
GLOBAL MODELS TURN THE HURRICANE NORTHWARD NEAR 60W. HOWEVER...THIS
SEEM TO BE AT LEAST IN PART DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF FLOYD IN THE
MODELS. THUS...THESE FORECASTS NEED TO BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT
AT THIS TIME.

THE INITIAL AND FORECAST WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED ON THE BASIS
OF A COUPLE OF ERS SATELLITE SCATTEROMETER OVERPASSES.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS GERT HAS A WELL DEVELOPED EYE. SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 90 KT...WHICH WILL BE THE
MAXIMUM INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS LESS ESTIMATED TO BE 285/14. THE SYNOPTIC
PATTERN IS BASICALLY UNCHANGED. WITH GERT CONTINUING WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWEST UNDER THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. THE RIDGE SEEMS TO STRENGTHEN
BEHIND FLOYD...KEEPING GERT ON A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK.
SEVERAL HURRICANE GUIDANCE MODELS...MOST NOTABLY THE NOGAPS AND THE
BAMM...HAVE A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST DUE TO A WEAKENING RIDGE
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THIS APPEARS TO BE THE
INFLUENCE OF FLOYD, AND MAY NOT BE REALIZED IF FLOYD MOVES ON OUT
AND IS INDEED NORTH OF OR NEAR THE RIDGELINE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS SHIFTED ONLY SLIGHTLY NORTHWARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. WHILE
THE FORECAST KEEPS GERT NORTH OF THE LEEWARDS...GERT COULD STILL BE
A THREAT TO THAT AREA IF THE STORM MOVES MORE TO THE WEST THAN
CURRENTLY FORECAST.
 
THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST FROM THE PREVIOUS
CYCLE.  BASICALLY THIS AGREES WITH SHIFOR AND IS SLIGHTLY STRONGER
THAN SHIPS.  SHIPS INDICATES AN INCREASE IN WIND SHEAR THAT ALSO MAY
BE RELATED TO FLOYD.

SATELLITE DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE CONSENSUS 5.5...100
KT.  THE EYE HAS BECOME BETTER DEFINED DURING THE DAY...ALTHOUGH THE
DEEPEST CONVECTION HAS NOT YET COMPLETELY WRAPPED AROUND THE CENTER. 
LACKING ANY IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS TO THE CONTRARY...GERT BECOMES THE
FOURTH MAJOR...CATEGORY THREE OR HIGHER ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON
SCALE...HURRICANE OF THE 1999 SEASON.  OUTFLOW LOOKS OUTSTANDING IN
ALL QUADS AND SSTS ARE VERY WARM.  GERT HAS AN EXCELLENT CHANCE TO
REACH CATEGORY FOUR STATUS BEFORE IT ENCOUNTERS SOME SOUTHERLY
SHEAR...SUGGESTED BY THE SHIPS MODEL...ASSOCIATED WITH TWO UPPER
LOWS AHEAD OF THE HURRICANE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/13.  RIDGING NORTH OF GERT LOOKS SOLID FOR
THE NEXT 36 HOURS.  BEYOND THAT...THE MAIN LOBE OF THE RIDGE
RETREATS EASTWARD AS FLOYD INTERACTS WITH AN APPROACHING SHORT WAVE
ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST.  THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER LOW NEAR 60
WEST MAY ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE TRACK.  THE PRIMIARY GUIDANCE
MODELS TAKE GERT ON A MORE NORTHWESTERLY PATH AT THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS WOULD LESSEN THE POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE
LESSER ANTILLES.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHLTY NORTH
OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

TWO NOAA AIRCRAFT ARE CURRENTLY FLYING IN THE ENVIRONMENTS OF

THE APPEARANCE OF GERT HAS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE THIS EVENING. 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 102 AND 115 KT. 
IN FACT...THE PAST FEW ESTIMATES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN
OBJECTIVE TECHNIQUE ARE UP TO 120 KT OR MORE.  THE INTENSITY IS
INCREASED TO 110 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  IF GERT CAN MAINTAIN ITS
CURRENT STRUCTURE FOR A FEW MORE HOURS IT WILL PROBABLY BE ASSIGNED 
CATEGORY FOUR STATUS.  OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO LOOK OUTSTANDING IN
ALL QUADS.   THERE IS SOME INDICATION OF INCREASED SHEAR AT THE END
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LOW TO THE
NORTHWEST OF THE CYCLONE...AND THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR ONLY
MODEST ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING.  

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN FORWARD SPEED OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS BUT THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AS 280/12.  THE SYNOPTIC
REASONING IS UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  RIDGING NORTH OF
GERT SHOULD KEEP GERT ON A WEST/WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR 36 HOURS. 
BEYOND THAT...THE MAIN LOBE OF THE RIDGE RETREATS EASTWARD AS FLOYD
INTERACTS WITH AN APPROACHING SHORT WAVE ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST. 
MOST GUIDANCE MODELS TAKE GERT ON A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK BY 72
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...BUT IT IS STILL ON THE LEFT SIDE OF
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE GUIDANCE.  IF GERT IS KIND ENOUGH TO FOLLOW
EVEN THE OFFICIAL TRACK IT WILL PASS SAFELY NORTH OF THE LESSER
ANTILLES.

TWO NOAA AIRCRAFT ARE CURRENTLY FLYING IN THE ENVIRONMENTS OF
HURRICANES FLOYD AND GERT TO PROVIDE ENHANCED SOUNDING COVERAGE FOR

GERT CONTINUES TO LOOK IMPRESSIVE ON INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY WITH
CLOUDS TOPS TO -80C SURROUNDING THE EYE. THE EYE IS NOT YET THAT
WELL DEVELOPED...SO SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM SAB...TAFB...
AND AFWA REMAIN AT 115 KT...102 KT...AND 102 KT RESPECTIVELY. THE
MAXIMUM INTENSITY REMAINS AT 110 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS LITTLE CHANGED AT 280/11. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES THAT GERT IS CURRENTLY MOVING WESTWARD UNDER A STRONG
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. HOWEVER...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IS LOCATED NEAR 27N
60W...AND HURRICANE FLOYD AND A STRONG MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH ARE
NEAR AND OVER THE EASTERN U.S.. LARGER SCALE MODELS INDICATES A
COMBINATION OF THESE FEATURES WILL CREATE A LARGE WEAKNESS OR BREAK
IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. ALL
GUIDANCE RESPONDS TO THIS BY TURNING THE HURRICANE NORTHWEST BY 72
HOURS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THIS IDEA...BUT IS ALONG
THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE GUIDANCE. THIS IN CASE THE WEAKNESS IS NOT
AS PRONOUNCED AS CURRENTLY FORECAST...OR IN CASE THE HURRICANE
ITSELF BUILDS THE RIDGE FARTHER WESTWARD.
 
GERT CURRENTLY SHOWS GOOD OUTFLOW IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THIS COMBINED
WITH THE STILL-DEVELOPING EYE AND COLD CONVECTIVE TOPS INDICATES
CONTINUED STRENGTHENING...AT LEAST FOR A DAY OR SO. AFTER THAT
TIME...INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL LOW
MAY STOP DEVELOPMENT OR CAUSE A SLIGHT WEAKENING...AS SUGGESTED BY
THE SHIPS MODEL. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS GERT TO 120 KT IN 24
HOURS FOLLOWED BY A SLIGHT WEAKENING. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT GERT
COULD STRENGTHEN FASTER THAN FORECAST DURING THE FIRST 24 TO 36
HOURS.

GERT CLOUD PATTERN CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. THE EYE IS MORE DEFINED AND
DISTINCT ON IMAGES AND IS SURROUNDED BY A RING OF DEEP CONVECTION
WITH TOPS BETWEEN -70 AND 75 DEGREES CELSIUS.  OBJECTIVE AND
SUBJECTIVE NUMBERS ARE UP TO 6.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE. BASED ON THIS
DATA...WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 115 KNOTS.  THIS MAKES GERT THE FOURTH
CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR SIMPSON-SCALE OF THE SEASON.
SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE EXPECTED DURING HE NEXT 3 DAYS.

INITIAL MOTION IS 275/11. THE HURRICANE IS MOVING WESTWARD AROUND
THE PERIPHERY OF A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  HOWEVER...AS THE
HURRICANE MOVES WESTWARD...IT WILL ENCOUNTER A WEAKENING OF THE
RIDGE...ERODED BY HURRICANE FLOYD AND ANOTHER DISTURBANCE. A GRADUAL
TURN TO THE NORTHWEST IS THEN INDICATED AS THE HURRICANE APPROACHES
55W. THIS TRACK WOULD BRING THE HURRICANE WELL NORTH TO THE LEEWARD

...COR TO WRONG TEXT...

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT GERT HAS AN IMPRESSIVE CLOUD
PATTERN WITH AN EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A ROUND CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST
AND NUMEROUS BANDING FEATURES. THE OUTFLOW IS EXCELLENT IN ALL
QUADRANTS.  T-NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 6.5 AND 7.0 ON THE
DVORAK SCALE.  THIS MAKES GERT A VERY STRONG CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE
ON THE SAFFIR/SIMPSON SCALE.  HURRICANES NORMALLY DO NOT KEEP SUCH
AN INTENSITY FOR A LONG TIME.  HENCE...FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE
EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 275/11. THE HURRICANE IS MOVING WESTWARD AROUND
THE PERIPHERY OF A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WHICH IS CONTROLLING THE
MOTION AT THIS TIME.  LATER...GERT WILL BE APPROACHING THE UPPER-
LOW PARTIALLY GENERATED BY THE OUTFLOW OF FLOYD.  THIS FEATURE...
WHICH IS CLEARLY OBSERVED ON WATER VAPOR IMAGES WILL PROBABLY FORCE
THE HURRICANE ON A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...AWAY FROM THE LEEWARD
ISLANDS.  THEREAFTER...A BROAD TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO PERSIST
OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL STEER THE HURRICANE ON A MORE
NORTHERLY TRACK.   THIS IS THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF THE
TRACK AND LONG RANGE GLOBAL MODELS.

A NOAA GULFSTREAM PLANE WILL SAMPLE THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE HURRICANE
TONIGHT AND AN AIR FORCE PLANE WILL PENETRATE THE EYE EARLY
THURSDAY.

THE SATELLITE PRESENTATION OF GERT IS NOT QUITE AS IMPRESSIVE THIS
EVENING AS IT WAS THIS AFTERNOON.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES AT
00Z WERE 127 AND 140 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...BUT A RECENT 3 HR
AVERAGE OF THE RAW OBJECTIVE DVORAK NUMBERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN ALGORITHM WAS ABOUT 115 KT.  FOR CONTINUITY...THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY IS HELD AT 130 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.  THE TRUTH WILL BE
REVEALED LATER THIS MORNING WHEN A RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WILL BE
IN THE CYCLONE.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL INDICATES SLIGHT
WEAKENING OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS...BUT GERT IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN
A VERY POWERFUL HURRICANE. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 275/9...A BIT SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 
DROPSONDE DATA FROM THE NOAA GULFSTREAM JET NICELY SHOW THE MID-
LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE.  THE DATA ALSO SHOW
A BREAK IN THE RIDGE ALONG 60W...AND MOST OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES
A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST BY THIS LONGITUDE.  THE 18Z AVIATION HAS A
HORRIBLE INITIALIZATION OF THE VORTEX REGION...WITH SOUTHEAST WINDS
A FEW HUNDRED MILES AHEAD OF THE HURRICANE AT 500 MB THAT ARE 40-50

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER HAS JUST REACHED GERT
REPORTING A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 941 MB AND 119 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS
IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT. AN EYEWALL DROPSONDE REPORTED 141 KT
ABOVE THE SURFACE. BASED ON THIS...AND A SLIGHTLY DEGRADED SATELLITE
SIGNATURE...THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE DECREASED TO 125 KT. THE AIRCRAFT
ALSO REPORTED CONCENTRIC EYEWALLS WITH DIAMETERS OF 18 AND 30 NM.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 285/9...A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY. ALL MODEL GUIDANCE IS INDICATING A TURN TO THE
NORTH OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. WHILE THE UNANIMITY IS HARD TO
DISAGREE WITH...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS NORTHERLY FLOW ABOUT 400
NM NORTH OF GERT. THIS SUGGESTS THE TURN MAY BE SLOWER THAN THE
MODELS INDICATE. THE FORECAST TACK GOES ALONG WITH THE TURN AND IS
SHIFTED NORTH FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...BUT IS ALONG THE SOUTHERN
EDGE OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE.
 
GERT CONTINUES TO HAVE IMPRESSIVE CONVECTION AND GOOD OUTFLOW. THE
SHIPS MODEL WEAKENS GERT THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO
INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR. A LOOK AT THE 200 MB WIND FIELDS IN THE
AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS DOES NOT OBVIOUSLY SHOW SUCH SHEAR. IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT CONCENTRIC EYEWALL CYCLES MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT IN
INTENSITY CHANGES THAN SHEAR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A
SLIGHT WEAKENING SIMILAR TO THE LAST FORECAST IN CASE SOME INCREASE
IN SHEAR DOES OCCUR. HOWEVER...THIS IS A LOW CONFIDENCE FORECAST...
AND THE MAXIMUM WINDS MAY VERY WELL OSCILLATE IN THE 115-130 KT
RANGE DURING THE PERIOD.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT GERT CONTINUES TO BE WELL ORGANIZED
WITH A DISTINCT EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST. THERE
ARE BANDING FEATURES AND AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW.  HOWEVER...GERT IS
NOT AS STRONG AS IT WAS 24 HOURS AGO...AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE
DVORAK T-NUMBERS.  THESE FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY WERE EXPECTED AND
ARE FORECAST TO CONTINUE.  

GERT HAS BEEN MOVING BETWEEN WEST AND WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK WHILE
LOCATED SOUTH OF A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  HOWEVER...MODELS
UNANIMOUSLY INDICATE THAT GERT SHOULD TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST
LATER TODAY OR FRIDAY AS WESTERN PORTION OF THE RIDGE WEAKENS. THE
FORECAST IS PRACTICALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MODEL ENSEMBLE.  ON
THIS TRACK...GERT SHOULD MOVE WELL NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS AND
OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC.  AT THIS TIME...ONLY BERMUDA APPEARS TO BE
NEAR THE PATH OF GERT.   

ANOTHER AIR FORCE PLANE WILL CHECK GERT LATER TODAY.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECONNAISSANCE DATA SINCE ABOUT 20Z.  AT THAT
TIME PEAK FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS WERE 127 KT...THIS SUPPORTS A SURFACE
WIND OF 115 KT.  DROPSONDES IN THE NORTHEAST AND NORTHWEST QUADRANTS
OF THE EYEWALL REPORTED SURFACE WINDS OF ABOUT 85 AND 110 KT
RESPECTIVELY.  SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 127
AND 115 KT.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 115 KT FOR THIS
PACKAGE...AND ANOTHER AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN THE CYCLONE AT 06Z.  THERE
IS NO SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL RUN FOR THIS CYCLE...BUT THE SPREAD OF
THE BAM MODELS SUGGESTS LOW SHEAR OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  WATER
TEMPERATURES REMAIN WARM SO THE CURRENT INTENSITY IS MAINTAINED
THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD...ALTHOUGH FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY
ASSOCIATED WITH INNER CORE/EYEWALL DYNAMICS ARE TO BE EXPECTED. 
WIND RADII HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY ADJUSTED BASED ON THE LATEST
RECON DATA.

THE INTIAL MOTION REMAINS 300/9.  THERE HAS BEEN A NOTICEABLE SHIFT
IN THE GUIDANCE...WITH ALL MODELS DEPENDENT ON THE AVN SHOWING A
LEFTWARD TURN AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  ONCE AGAIN...THE AVN IS
HAVING SEVERE PROBLEMS INITIALIZING THE VORTEX...AND THIS APPEARS TO
LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MID-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE SOUTHWEST OF
THE CYCLONE.  THE NOGAPS AND THE UKMET TRACKS DO NOT HAVE THE LEFT
TURN.  THERE ARE TWO GFDL RUNS...ONE RUN OFF THE NOGAPS...GFNI...AND
ONE OFF THE AVN...GFDI.  ONLY THE GFDI SHOWS THE TURN.  I AM NOT
READY TO BITE ON THIS GUIDANCE AND MAINTAIN A SLOWLY RECURVING TRACK
THAT IS HALFWAY BETWEEN THE UKMET AND GFNI.  ON THIS TRACK BERMUDA
IS A POTENTIAL TARGET IN ABOUT 4 DAYS.

THE MAXIMUM WINDS IN THE PUBLIC ADVISORY ARE SET TO 135 MPH FOR

THE LATEST AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER FLIGHT REPORTED 149 KT
WINDS AT 868 MB AND 123 KT WINDS AT THE SURFACE ON AN EYEWALL
DROPSONDE. THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS 942 MB. SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE 127 KT...115
KT...AND 115 KT RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT DATA...THE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE RAISED TO 120 KT. THIS INCREASE IS MOST
LIKELY A MINOR FLUCTUATION AND NOT THE START OF INTENSIFICATION.

GERT IS A LITTLE WEST OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...AND THE
INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 295/09. OTHER THAN THIS... THERE
IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY. GERT IS EXPECTED TO
GRADUALLY TURN NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST TOWARD A BREAK IN THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE NEAR BERMUDA. AS SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...
THE AVIATION MODEL BASED GUIDANCE BENDS THE STORM A LITTLE TO THE
LEFT BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IGNORES THIS AND MORE FOLLOWS THE GFDN AND UKMET...WITH A BEND TO
THE RIGHT. THE TRACK IS SHIFTED SOMEWHAT TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS
TRACK DUE TO THE CURRENT POSITION AND INITIAL MOTION. 

GERT CONTINUES TO HAVE CONVECTIVE TOPS TO -70C SURROUNDING THE
CENTER AND GOOD OUTFLOW IN ALL BUT THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT. INTENSITY
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN THE SYSTEM...BUT SATELLITE IMAGERY
INDICATES NO OBVIOUS REASON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THE UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH NORTHWEST OF GERT MAY CAUSE SOME INCREASED VERTICAL SHEAR BY
72 HOURS...BUT IT IS MORE LIKELY CONCENTRIC EYEWALL CYCLES WILL BE
THE DOMINATING INFLUENCE ON THE INTENSITY DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THE INTENSITY FORECAST REFLECTS THIS...MAINTAINING 115-120
KT WINDS THROUGH 72 HOURS.

MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT GERT COULD COME UNCOMFORTABLY
CLOSE TO BERMUDA AFTER THIS FORECAST PERIOD. THEREFORE...INTERESTS
IN BERMUDA SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE HURRICANE OVER THE
WEEKEND.

THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT
DATA AND PERIPHERAL SHIP REPORTS.

GERT CONTINUES TO BE A POWERFUL HURRICANE.  SATELLITE WIND ESTIMATES
FROM SAB AND TAFB ARE OSCILLATING BETWEEN 6.0 AND 6.5 ON THE DVORAK-
SCALE.  THE OUTFLOW IS BEGINNING TO BE RESTRICTED TO THE NORTHWEST
...PROBABLY BECAUSE THE HURRICANE IS APPROACHING THE UPPER-LEVEL MID
OCEANIC TROUGH.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE EXPECTED AND
GERT SHOULD REMAIN AS A SEVERE HURRICANE.  HOWEVER...IN GENERAL...A
SLIGHT WEAKENING TREND SHOULD BEGIN DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS
INDICATED BY THE SHIPS MODEL.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/09. THERE HAS BEEN A SMALL CHANGE IN THE
GUIDANCE.  IT APPEARS THAT THE SHARP NORTHWARD TURN COULD BE DELAYED
AND INSTEAD IS FORECAST TO BE MORE GRADUAL.  EVEN THE UK MODEL...HAS
THE TURN A FEW DEGREES FARTHER TO THE WEST.  THE AVN WAS THE FIRST
MODEL TO SUGGEST THIS TURN.  THIS CHANGE...ALTHOUGH SMALL...

MOTION ESTIMATE IS 320/7.  GERT IS NEAR A WEAKNESS IN THE

ESTIMATES FROM SAB...TAFB...AND AFWA ARE 115 KT...102 KT...AND 102

SURFACE FRONTAL TROUGH...ASSOCIATED WITH EX-HURRICANE FLOYD...  
NORTHWEST OF GERT...AND AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE JUST EAST OF THE
FRONTAL TROUGH. CURRENT TRENDS AND THE VARIOUS MODELS SUGGEST GERT
IS MOVING SLOWLY ENOUGH THAT IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET EAST OF THE

MOTION AS THE RIDGE WEAKENS IN ADVANCE OF A NEW DEEP LAYER TROUGH
DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN U.S.. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS
THIS SCENARIO...WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST IN THE FIRST 26
HOURS AND A MORE NORTHERLY MOTION AFTER 48 HOURS.

THE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO BE RESTRICTED TO THE
WEST...LIKELY DUE TO THE NORTHEAST-SOUTHWEST ORIENTED UPPER TROUGH
SITUATED ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO THE WEST OF GERT. HOWEVER...THE AVN AND

HURRICANE GERT DISCUSSION NUMBER  32
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SUN SEP 19 1999
 
GERT REMAINS A HEALTHY HURRICANE WITH A 25 NM DIAMETER EYE
SURROUNDED BY VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS. WHILE THE CONVECTION HAS ERODED
A LITTLE IN THE NORTH QUADRANT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS....DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN AT 127 KT AND 115 KT
RESPECTIVELY.  OBJECTIVE-BASED ESTIMATES ARE RUNNING IN THE SAME
RANGE.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 115 KT FOR THIS
ADVISORY...AND SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE LIKELY DURING THE
NEXT 24 HRS. SOME GRADUAL WEAKENING OF GERT IS FORECAST LATER IN THE
PERIOD DUE TO INCREASING SHEAR AND SLIGHTLY COOLER WATER. HOWEVER...
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT A JET STREAM APPROACHING FROM THE
NORTHWEST MAY ACT AS AN OUTFLOW MECHANISM RATHER THAN A SHEARING
MECHANISM. IF THAT OCCURS...GERT MAY NOT WEAKEN AT ALL AND MIGHT
STRENGTHEN.
 
THE 12 HOUR MOTION IS 330/8...WHILE A SHORTER TERM MOTION IS CLOSER
TO 315/6. A COMPROMISE INITIAL MOTION OF 325/7 IS USED FOR THIS
PACKAGE. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW LOCATED SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY NEAR
21N66W SHOULD HELP KEEP GERT ON A NORTHWEST TRACK FOR THE FIRST PART
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL RECURVATURE IN FRONT
OF THE DEVELOPING EASTERN U.S. DEEP LAYER TROUGH. SOME DISAGREEMENTS
HAVE CREPT INTO THE TRACK FORECAST GUIDANCE...WITH THE NOGAPS...
GFDL...AND UKMET MODELS MOVING THE STORM MUCH FASTER THAN THE AVN
AND THE VARIOUS BAM MODELS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS A SPEED
THAT IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE FASTER AND SLOWER MODELS.
 
INTERESTS IN BERMUDA SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
GERT.

HURRICANE GERT DISCUSSION NUMBER  33
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT SUN SEP 19 1999

GERT DOES NOT LOOK QUITE AS IMPRESSIVE AS IT DID EARLIER.  THE
AMOUNT OF COLD CLOUD TOPS IN THE CDO HAS DECREASED AND THE EYE IS
NOT THAT WELL-DEFINED.  UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED TO
THE SOUTHWEST.  NONETHELESS...IT IS A FORMIDABLE HURRICANE WITH A 30
N MI DIAMETER EYE AND A CLOSED WALL AS SUGGESTED BY MICROWAVE
IMAGERY DATA.  THE STATISTICAL INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME SHOWS
GERT MAINTAINING MAJOR HURRICANE STRENGTH FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS...AS
DOES THE NHC INTENSITY FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION...320/7...IS ABOUT THE SAME AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  GERT HAS TRACKED A BIT TO THE LEFT OF YESTERDAYS MOTION. 
THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF MORE DEEP-LAYER RIDGING TO
THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE AND STEERING AROUND A WEAK MID/UPPER
LEVEL CYCLONE JUST NORTHEAST OF PUERTO RICO.  HOWEVER A LARGE 500 MB
TROUGH IS PREDICTED TO BE OVER THE U.S. EAST COAST IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS...AND THIS SHOULD WEAKEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  AS A
CONSEQUENCE...GERT IS LIKELY TO TURN NORTHWARD GRADUALLY.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AND NEAR THE
WESTERN EDGE OF THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE.

HURRICANE GERT DISCUSSION NUMBER  34
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SUN SEP 19 1999

ALTHOUGH ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS KEEP THE CENTER OF THE
HURRICANE EAST OF BERMUDA...SEVERAL FACTORS DICTATE THE ISSUANCE OF
A HURRICANE WATCH AND TROPICAL STORM WARNING FOR THE ISLANDS AT THIS
TIME.  THESE INCLUDE: (A) UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FORECAST...(B) THE
SIZE AND STRENGTH OF GERT...(C) AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED...AND
(D) AVOIDING THE ISSUANCE OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS LATE AT NIGHT.

MOTION IS ALONG THE SAME HEADING WITH SOME INCREASE IN SPEED...
320/10.  THE TRACK FORECAST REASONING IS ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE. 
GERT IS CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE.  DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO...A LARGE 500 MB TROUGH NEAR 
THE EASTERN U.S. COAST IS EXPECTED TO TURN THE HURRICANE MORE
NORTHWARD.  HOWEVER THE TURN COULD BE DELAYED AND GERT COULD
COME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO BERMUDA. 

MICROWAVE DATA INDICATE THAT GERT UNDERWENT AN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT
CYCLE EARLIER TODAY...AND THIS MAY HAVE EXPLAINED WHY IT APPEARED
WEAKER AT THAT TIME.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST REMAINS THE SAME AS
BEFORE...AND MAINTAINS MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

LATE IN THE PERIOD...GERT MAY WEAKEN A LITTLE MORE THAN SHOWN HERE
...DUE TO A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.

11 PM EDT SUN SEP 19 1999
 
GERT REMAINS A FORMIDABLE HURRICANE THIS EVENING WITH A 25 NMI
DIAMETER EYE AND A SYMMETRIC CORE OF DEEP CONVECTION SURROUNDING 
IT. HOWEVER...THE CLOUD TOPS ARE NOT QUITE AS COLD OR EXTENSIVE 
AS THEY WERE 24 HRS AGO. THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 
115 KT...IN AGREEMENT WITH CURRENT DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES 
FROM TAFB AND SAB...AS WELL AS THAT OF THE OBJECTIVE-BASED
TECHNIQUE. GERT WILL LIKELY REMAIN A MAJOR HURRICANE FOR THE 
NEXT TWO DAYS.  BEYOND THIS POINT...WEAKENING IS INDICATED AS 
THE CYCLONE ENCOUNTERS COOLER WATER AND INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY
VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPING EASTERN U.S.
TROUGH. IN FACT...GERT MAY WEAKEN A LITTLE MORE THAN FORECAST.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 320/10 KT. THE SYNOPTIC REASONING
BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST IS UNCHANGED. GERT SHOULD CONTINUE TO
MOVE ON A GENERAL NORTHWESTERLY TRACK FOR THE NEXT 12-24 HRS THROUGH
THE WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  THEREAFTER...THE HURRICANE
SHOULD TURN MORE NORTHWARD...THEN NORTH-NORTHEAST IN RESPONSE TO 
A LARGE MID-TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH FORECAST TO DEVELOP ALONG THE
EASTERN U.S. COAST DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

THE HURRICANE WATCH AND TROPICAL STORM WARNING CONTINUES FOR
BERMUDA. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A SHORT DELAY IN THE 
NORTHWARD TURN WOULD BRING GERT DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO BERMUDA...
AND COULD PROMPT THE POSTING OF HURRICANE WARNINGS.  

ALL INTERESTS IN BERMUDA SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS HURRICANE.

11 PM EDT TUE SEP 21 1999
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 020/16.  THE MOTION SCENARIO IS
UNCHANGED WITH THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWING GERT BEING STEERED BY
THE FLOW TO THE EAST OF A LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN U.S.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY EXCEPT A LITTLE SLOWER AFTER 48 HOURS.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO
THE GFDL FORECAST AND TO THE LEFT OF MOST OTHER MODELS.  THE HPC
GUIDANCE IS THE ONLY TRACK FORECAST LEFT OF THE OFFICIAL.
 
DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES INDICATE SLOW WEAKENING
CONTINUES.  COLD SSTS SHOULD BE ENCOUNTERED IN 24 HOURS OR SO AND
THIS SHOULD HASTEN THE WEAKENING PROCESS.  ALSO THE AVIATION MODEL
LOSES THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION AFTER 36 HOURS AS IT IS ABSORBED
INTO THE LARGER TROUGH.  SO THE FORECAST IS FOR WEAKENING AND
EXTRATROPICAL TRANSFORMATION OVER THE NEXT 3 DAYS...IF THE LOW LEVEL
CIRCULATION SURVIVES THAT LONG.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 020/20...FASTER THAN EARLIER AS GERT
IS ACCELERATING AHEAD OF THE LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN U.S.  WITH THE ACCELERATION THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BUT ON A SIMILAR TRACK...TAKING
GERT OVER EASTERN NEWFOUNDLAND IN ABOUT 30 HOURS.  THIS TRACK IS IN
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE INTERPOLATED NOGAPS AND GFDL GUIDANCE.

DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 77 AND 65
KT RESPECTIVELY...WITH DATA T NUMBERS INDICATING CONTINUED
WEAKENING.  DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER IS DECREASING ALTHOUGH
THERE IS STILL SOME IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT.  THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY IS LOWERED TO 75 KT WITH THIS ADVISORY.  VERY COLD SSTS
SHOULD BE ENCOUNTERED IN 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS AND GFDL GUIDANCE SHOWING ABOUT 55 KT AS GERT
APPROACHES NEWFOUNDLAND.  

THE AVIATION MODEL LOSES THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION AFTER ABOUT 36
HOURS AS IT IS ABSORBED INTO THE LARGER TROUGH.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR AN EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION AT 36 HOURS AND
DISSIPATION/ABSORPTION AFTER 48 HOURS.

...WINDS 200/23 KT...AND SEAS OF 45 FT...INDICATING THAT THE CENTER
OF GERT PASSED JUST TO ITS WEST.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS 030/26 KT.
GERT IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE
MID- TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S..  THIS SHOULD
CONTINUE TO STEER GERT ON A GENERAL EAST-NORTHEAST TRACK FOR THE
NEXT 12-24 HRS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A BLEND OF THE GFDL
AND UK METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE TRACK GUIDANCE AND IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. THIS TRACK BRINGS GERT JUST EAST OF THE
AVALON PENINSULA EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. 

THE LAST AVAILABLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE DEEP CONVECTION 
IS DISPLACED EAST OF THE CENTER. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A NARROW
DRY POCKET ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE HURRICANE. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE REDUCED TO 70 KT.  GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST
AS GERT ENCOUNTERS COOLER WATERS...WITH EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION   
EXPECTED WITHIN 24 HRS.

THE 34-KNOT RADII IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED

THE CENTER OF GERT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE ON SATELLITE
IMAGERY...BUT CANADIAN BUOY OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT GERT IS
BASICALLY ON THE TRACK OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...OR PERHAPS A
LITTLE TO THE EAST...AS SUGGESTED BY A LATE REPORT FROM THE CANADIAN
BUOY AT 44.3N/53.6W.  INITIAL MOTION IS 030/24.  GERT WILL PASS VERY
CLOSE TO THE AVALON PENINSULA WITHIN THE NEXT 6 HOURS.

THE DEEP CONVECTION IS DISPLACED WELL TO THE EAST OF THE CENTER OF
CIRCULATION.  THE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE NOW LESS THAN
HURRICANE STRENGTH AND GERT IS DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM.  BUOY
OBS SUGGEST THAT WINDS MAY STILL BE IN THE VICINITY OF 60 KT.  WITH
NO CONVECTION REMAINING NEAR THE CENTER...GERT WILL BECOME
EXTRATROPICAL VERY SHORTLY.

STORM AND HURRICANE FORCE WIND WARNINGS REMAIN POSTED FOR THE

TROPICAL DEPRESSION TEN SPECIAL DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
6 AM EDT SUN SEP 19 1999
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES INCREASED CONVECTION NEAR AND EAST OF
THE CENTER OF THE BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA IN THE CENTRAL GULF OF
MEXICO. OBSERVATIONS FROM BUOYS 42001 AND 42003 SUGGEST A MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE AROUND 1005 MB...WITH 42003 REPORTING 30 KT WINDS
AT 0900Z. THUS...ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION
TEN.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 345/04. A STRONG DEEP LAYER TROUGH IS FORECAST
TO AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THIS...IN
THEORY...SHOULD TURN THE CYCLONE NORTHEAST OR EVEN EAST-NORTHEAST
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. OR FLORIDA. HOWEVER...MODEL GUIDANCE
HAS A GREAT VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS. THE UKMET TAKES THE CYCLONE ON THE
TRACK SUGGESTED BY THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN. ON THE OTHER HAND...THE AVN
LETS THE DEPRESSION LINGER IN THE GULF UNTIL THE ONCOMING COLD FRONT
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH CATCHES IT. THE AVN ALSO DEVELOPS A
SECONDARY LOW OFF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
GOES WITH THE SYNOPTICALLY SUGGESTED TRACK AND IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN A NORTHERLY UKMET AND A SOUTHERLY LBAR AND NHC98E. 

DEEP CONVECTION IS STILL POORLY ORGANIZED...WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES OF ONLY 25 KT. THE LARGE SCALE MODELS DEVELOP AN UPPER
LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE EASTERN GULF. HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SUGGESTS A WEAK TROUGH OR SHEAR AXIS IS EMBEDDED IN THE
ANTICYCLONE JUST WEST OF THE DEPRESSION...WHICH RESTRICTS OUTFLOW TO
THE WEST. THESE POINTS SUGGEST INTENSIFICATION SHOULD BE SLOW. LATER
INTENSIFICATION WILL DEPEND ON HOW THE DEPRESSION INTERACTS WITH THE
DEVELOPING TROUGH. BY 72 HOURS THE CYCLONE COULD SHEAR OFF...START
BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL...OR EVOLVE INTO A HYBRID OR SUBTROPICAL
CYCLONE. THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL BRING THE SYSTEM TO 50 KT IN 48
HOURS AND KEEP THAT INTENSITY AT 72 HOURS. THIS IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN POSSIBLE WEAKENING DUE TO SHEAR AND POSSIBLE DEEPENING DUE
TO BAROCLINIC INTERACTION.

WHILE NO WATCHES OR WARNINGS WILL BE ISSUED WITH THIS PACKAGE...THEY
MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY. RESIDENTS OF THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN
GULF COAST SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

BUOY AND SHIP DATA ALONG WITH SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATE THAT THE
DEPRESSION CENTER IS LOCATED A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH THAN ORIGINALLY
ANTICIPATED...NOT UNUSUAL IN A BROAD CIRCULATION.  BASED ON
THIS...THE INITIAL MOTION IS 010/06.  THE SYNOPTIC REASONING REMAINS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION WITH A TROUGH FORECAST TO AMPLIFY
OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THIS SHOULD TURN THE
CYCLONE NORTHEAST OR EAST-NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. OR
FLORIDA.  HOWEVER...MODEL GUIDANCE STILL HAS MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS. THE
LBAR...BAMM...BAMD AND A98 TAKE THE CYCLONE ON THE TRACK SUGGESTED
BY THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN. ON THE OTHER HAND...THE AVN LETS THE SYSTEM
LINGER IN THE GULF OF MEXICO...WHILE THE GFDL AND BAMS MOVE THE
SYSTEM SOUTHEASTWARD.  THE NOGAPS HAS THE TROUGH MISSING THE SYSTEM
AND THE TRAILING HIGH PUSHING THE IT SOUTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK
IS FOR A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.
 
THE DEEP CONVECTION IS BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND IT APPEARS THAT
THE OUTFLOW ON THE WEST AND NORTHWEST IS IMPROVING.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN AT 25 KT.  A SHIP TOWING A BARGE TO THE
SOUTH OF THE DEPRESSION AND LOCATED UNDERNEATH THE DEEP CONVECTION
REPORTED AT 16Z THAT HE HAD WINDS OF APPROXIMATELY 35 KNOTS AND A

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT MON SEP 20 1999
 
INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE LOW LEVEL CENTER OF
HARVEY IS LOCATED NORTHWEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION...ALTHOUGH THE
CENTER ITSELF IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO FIND. THE 08Z OBSERVATION FROM
BUOY 42003 INDICATES 31 KT WINDS AND A 1002.7 MB PRESSURE...WHICH
WOULD IMPLY A CENTRAL PRESSURE AROUND 1001 OR 1000 MB. CONVECTIVE
ORGANIZATION HAS NOT IMPROVED DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS...SO THE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS REMAIN 40 KT.

BASED ON LIMITED SATELLITE IMAGERY BEFORE AND AFTER THE ECLIPSE...
THE INITIAL MOTION FOR THIS PACKAGE IS 065/02. HOWEVER...THE BUOY
OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THE MOTION MIGHT BE A LITTLE FASTER. THERE IS
LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE...WITH HARVEY EXPECTED TO MOVE EAST-NORTHEAST AHEAD OF THE
DEVELOPING EASTERN U.S. DEEP LAYER TROUGH. MOST MODELS AGREE WITH
THIS...ALTHOUGH SOME HAVE A MORE EASTWARD MOTION TOWARD THE FLORIDA
WEST COAST FOLLOWED BY AN EAST-NORTHEAST MOTION. THE FORECAST TRACK
IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...WITH A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO THE
SOUTH DURING THE FIRST 48 HOURS. THE ONE REAL MODEL OUTLIER IS THE
NOGAPS...WHICH MOVES HARVEY SOUTHEAST INTO THE CARIBBEAN.

ALTHOUGH THE CONVECTION IS STILL POORLY ORGANIZED...SOME DEVELOPMENT
HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. WHILE STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR IS
PRESENT OVER THE NORTHERN GULF COAST...HARVEY IS LIKELY TO REMAIN IN
A SOMEWHAT FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO. THE
SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION WILL BE DETERMINED BY HOW THE STORM INTERACTS
WITH THE TROUGH. THE INTENSITY FORECAST BRINGS THE STORM TO 50 KT IN
24 HOURS...THEN CALLS FOR SLOW WEAKENING DUE TO INCREASED SHEARING
AND BAROCLINIC INTERACTION. HARVEY IS FORECAST TO BECOME
EXTRATROPICAL BY 72 HOURS.
 
BECAUSE OF THE FORECAST TRACK A TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS IN
EFFECT ON THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA. IF HARVEY IS MOVING FASTER...

RECON OBSERVATIONS THIS MORNING SHOW A SLIGHT PRESSURE FALL...TO 998
MB...BUT NO STRONGER WINDS THAN YESTERDAY...SO FAR.  THE SYSTEM
REMAINS RATHER DISORGANIZED-LOOKING WITH THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER NEAR
THE NORTHWEST EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION AND LIMITED UPPER-LEVEL
OUTFLOW.  HOWEVER THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF STRENGTHENING...AND IN
FACT THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN MAKES HARVEY A HURRICANE BEFORE
LANDFALL ON THE FLORIDA WEST COAST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS MORE
CONSERVATIVE AND BRINGS THE SYSTEM CLOSE TO HURRICANE STRENGTH.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO A LACK OF GOOD CENTER FIXES. THE
STORM APPEARS TO BE MOVING FASTER THAN EARLIER TODAY... BUT PROBABLY
NOT QUITE AS FAST AS THE ESTIMATE SHOWN IN THE 12Z INTERMEDIATE
ADVISORY.  MY BEST GUESS AT THIS TIME IS 065/06.  HARVEY IS EXPECTED
TO GRADUALLY ACCELERATE AS IT IS STEERED BY THE WESTERLY FLOW ON THE
SOUTH SIDE OF A LARGE MID-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES.  THE
CURRENT NHC FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE AND
TAKES THE CENTER NEAR THE COAST IN 24 HOURS.
 
THE NEW FORECAST NECESSITATES THE ISSUANCE OF TROPICAL STORM
WARNINGS/WATCHES AND A HURRICANE WATCH AS SHOWN IN THE ADVISORY.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM REMAINS DISORGANIZED WITH THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER LOCATED TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE MAIN AREA OF DEEP
CONVECTION.  THE STORM IS PROBABLY ALSO ENTRAINING SOME DRIER AIR
FROM THE NORTHWEST AS WELL.  THE GFDL MODEL CONTINUES TO INDICATE
THAT SOME STRENGTHENING WILL OCCUR BUT OTHER GUIDANCE...SUCH AS THE
NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...SUGGESTS WEAKENING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
INDICATES ONLY A SLIGHT ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN STRENGTH.

ACCORDING TO RECONNAISSANCE AND SATELLITE FIXES...THE MOVEMENT HAS
BEEN A BIT ERRATIC OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS AND INITIAL MOTION IS
REDUCED TO 075/5.  HOWEVER...BASED ON THE STEERING CURRENT IMPLIED
BY THE LARGER-SCALE FLOW...ACCELERATION TOWARD THE EAST AND
NORTHEAST IS FORECAST...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  

SHIP REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE EXTENT OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS
IS LARGER THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED...ABOUT 150 N MI OVER THE
SOUTHEAST QUADRANT.  THIS MEANS THAT THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING AND

RECONNAISSANCE FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS INDICATE THAT HARVEY IS MOVING
080/9 KT...AND THIS IS THE INITIAL MOTION. THE LAST RECON FIX 
ALONG WITH CURRENT RADAR TRENDS SUGGESTS THAT HARVEY MAYBE MOVING
SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF EAST.  THE APPROACHING MID LATITUDE TROUGH IS
EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE THE SYSTEM ON A MORE NORTHEASTERLY TRACK 
WITHIN THE NEXT 24.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS A GENERAL
EASTWARD MOTION THROUGH 12 HRS WITH A NORTHEAST TURN THEREAFTER  
WITH INCREASING SPEED.  THIS TRACK IS SLIGHTLY SOUTH AND FASTER
THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFDL
AND THE UKMET.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM REMAINS DISORGANIZED WITH THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER LOCATED ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE CLOUD SHIELD.
THE STORM IS PROBABLY ALSO ENTRAINING SOME DRIER AIR FROM THE
NORTHWEST AS WELL.  DATA FROM THE DOPPLER RADAR IN TAMPA SUGGESTS
THAT MID-LEVEL CENTER IS DECOUPLED FROM THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INDICATES ONLY A SLIGHT ADDITIONAL INCREASE 
IN STRENGTH...WITH EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION EXPECTED BY 48 HRS...
ALTHOUGH THIS MAY OCCUR SOONER.  
 
THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON A SHIP REPORT AND WIND
ANALYSES FROM THE HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION.

A TROPICAL STORM WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT FOR THE FLORIDA EAST COAST
FROM SOUTH OF FLAGLER BEACH TO BOCA RATON.  THE TROPICAL STORM WATCH
REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM BOCA RATON TO FLORIDA CITY. IF THE TRACK
SHIFTS FURTHER SOUTHWARD A TROPICAL STORM WARNING MAY BE REQUIRED

RECONNAISSANCE FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT OVER THE LAST FEW HOURS INDICATE THAT HARVEY HAS TURNED TO
THE SOUTHEAST.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 130/9.  HARVEY IS NOT WELL
ORGANIZED...WITH MOST OF THE HEAVY RAIN AND STRONG WINDS TO THE

MOST GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT HARVEY WILL TURN TO THE EAST THEN
NORTHEAST AND RAPIDLY ACCELERATE IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING MID
LATITUDE TROUGH.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED ON THE CURRENT MOTION...AND HAS SOMEWHAT
LESS ACCELERATION AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO THE MORE
SOUTHERLY INITIAL TRACK.
 
BASED ON RECENT FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS FROM THE RECON AIRCRAFT...THE

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER INVESTIGATING THE BROAD LOW
PRESSURE OVER THE BAY OF CAMPECHE FOUND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 1003
MB AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 44 KT SOUTH OF THE CENTER.
SINCE THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED 15 KT WINDS OVER MUCH OF THE REMAINDER
OF THE CIRCULATION...IT IS POSSIBLE THE 44 KT IS DUE TO FUNNELING
ALONG THE COAST OR DOWNBURSTS. HOWEVER...THE SYSTEM IS BETTER
ORGANIZED IN BOTH WINDS AND CONVECTION THAN 24 HOURS AGO...AND
ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION ELEVEN.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS VERY UNCERTAIN. IF THIS IS THE SAME CENTER
SEEN 24 HR AGO...THE MOTION IS 225/04. SINCE THAT IS NOT CERTAIN...
THE INITIAL MOTION IS SET TO STATIONARY. LITTLE MOTION IS LIKELY FOR
THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS AS A DEEP LAYER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN
GULF OF MEXICO MOVES EASTWARD AND WEAKENS. AFTER THAT TIME...ENOUGH
RIDGING SHOULD DEVELOP NORTH OF THE CYCLONE TO ALLOW A
WEST-NORTHWEST DRIFT. THIS SCENARIO IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE
LARGE SCALE MODELS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH DUE TO
PROXIMITY TO LAND AND MOST OF THE INFLOW BYPASSING THE DEPRESSION
FOR THE NORTHERN GULF SURFACE TROUGH. HOWEVER...UPPER LEVEL
CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING IF THE CENTER DRIFTS

THE INITIAL MOTION IS STATIONARY. THE CYCLONE REMAINS A BROAD
CIRCULATION AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF A TROUGH LYING NORTHEAST-
SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO...AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING OVER TEXAS AND
NORTHERN MEXICO. THIS COMBINATION SHOULD PRODUCE A SLOW MOTION FOR
AT LEAST THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS. AFTER THAT...THE RIDGE SHOULD
SHIFT EAST AS A TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE CENTRAL U.S....WHICH MAY
ALLOW A SLIGHTLY FASTER NORTHWARD MOTION. LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE
AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO...ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS ON HOW
FAST THE RIDGE WILL MOVE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING...AS AN
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO REMAIN THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD. THE MAIN INHIBITING FACTORS CURRENTLY ARE PROXIMITY
TO LAND AND MUCH OF THE WOULD BE INFLOW BYPASSING THE DEPRESSION FOR

TROUGH. BY 48 HOURS THE TROUGH SHOULD WEAKEN AS ITS UPPER SUPPORT
MOVES INTO THE ATLANTIC...AND THE DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO BE
SLIGHTLY FARTHER FROM THE COAST. BASED ON THESE EXPECTATIONS...SOME
MODEST STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AFTER 36 HOURS. THIS IS ALSO BASED
ON THE PREMISE THE THE CYCLONE WILL NOT FALL APART PRIOR TO 36

RAIN CONTINUES TO BE THE IMPORTANT WEATHER FACTOR WITH SEVERAL LARGE
CONVECTIVE CLUSTERS OVER PORTIONS OF EASTERN MEXICO.

THE DEPRESSION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY ON IR IMAGES.
HOWEVER...DATA FROM THE LATEST RECON EARLIER TONIGHT INDICATED THE
EXISTENCE OF A LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION AND A 1004 MB MINIMUM PRESSURE.
INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 30 KNOTS...AND I AM BEING GENEROUS.  
IT IS HARD TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING WITH THE PREVAILING PATTERN BUT
SHIPS AND SHIFOR SUGGEST INTENSIFICATION.  THIS COULD HAPPEN ONLY IF
THE DEPRESSION SURVIVES DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS AND MOVES
AWAY FROM LAND.  BY THEN...GLOBAL MODELS DEVELOP AN UPPER-LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM.  SINCE SHIPS IS THE ONLY RELIABLE GAME
IN TOWN...SMALL STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED BEYOND 48 HOURS. 

THE FORECAST TRACK IS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE MODELS ARE
DIVERGENT.  BOTH THE AVN AND UK GLOBAL MODELS BRING THE DEPRESSION
ON A GENERAL NORTH-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWARD TRACK. THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE EASTWARD SHIFT OF THE 500 MB HIGH CURRENTLY NORTH OF THE
DEPRESSION.  THEREFORE..THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR LITTLE
MOTION DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO AND THEN A SLOW NORTHWARD TRACK. 
I AM NOT SURE IF THE DEPRESSION WILL LAST THAT LONG.
 
TORRENTIAL RAINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES OVER
PORTIONS OF EASTERN MEXICO.

THE LATEST DATA RELAYED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE CENTER IS SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE LAST FEW
FIXES BUT ESSENTIALLY HAS BEEN MEANDERING THE LAST 6 HOURS OR SO.
IN FACT THE LAST MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM THE AIRCRAFT STATED THAT THEY
WERE HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING A CLOSED CIRCULATION CENTER. THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE FOR THIS PACKAGE IS STATIONARY. 

THE FORECAST TRACK GUIDANCE REMAINS QUITE SCATTERED WITH THE GFDN
AND NOGAPS MEANDERING THE DEPRESSION.  MEANWHILE...THE AVN DRIFTS 
IT NORTHWARD. THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS
UNCHANGED WITH THE EXPECTED EASTWARD SHIFT OF THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC 
RIDGE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION ALLOWING A MORE NORTH-NORTHWEST TO
NORTH MOTION BEYOND 36 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE 
OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WHICH CALLS FOR LITTLE MOTION DURING THE
NEXT DAY OR SO FOLLOWED BY A SLOW GENERAL NORTHWARD TRACK.  HOWEVER
...THE SYSTEM MAY NOT LAST THAT LONG.
 
AS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR MOST OF ITS EXISTENCE...THE DEPRESSION IS
VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY IN SATELLITE IMAGERY WITH A CHAOTIC
CONVECTIVE PATTERN UNCHARACTERISTIC OF A DEVELOPING TROPICAL
CYCLONE. THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 30 KNOTS.  THE
RECONNAISSANCE REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 1007 MB...
UP 3 MB FROM LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.  AS MENTIONED IN THE LAST
ADVISORY...ITS HARD TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING GIVEN THE CURRENT
CLOUD PATTERN AND THE SYSTEMS PROXIMITY TO LAND. THE 00Z NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL DEVELOPS AN UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF
MEXICO BETWEEN 24 AND 48 HRS. THUS...FURTHER INTENSIFICATION WILL
ONLY OCCUR IF THE DEPRESSION SURVIVES THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS AND
MOVES AWAY FROM LAND.  

VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS...TO -80C...PERSIST ALONG THE EASTERN PORTION
OF MEXICO BETWEEN TAMPICO AND VERACRUZ.  THE PRIMARY THREAT THIS
SYSTEM POSES IS ONE OF HEAVY RAINS...AND THE COLLATERAL THREAT OF
FLASH FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES ESPECIALLY IN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN.

DATA FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER RELAYED AFTER THE
LAST ADVISORY SUGGESTS THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION ELEVEN HAS
RE-FORMED CONSIDERABLY TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE EARLIER FIXES. THE
CENTER IS POORLY DEFINED IN VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...SO IT IS NOT
CLEAR WHETHER THE CENTER IS STILL NEAR THE LOCATION SUGGESTED BY THE
AIRCRAFT. THE INITIAL POSITION IS A RE-LOCATION FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...AND MORE RE-LOCATION MAY BE NECESSARY THIS AFTERNOON WHEN
THE NEXT AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATES THE CYCLONE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ASSUMED TO BE 315/4...WHICH IS THE 24 HOUR
MOTION. THE DEPRESSION IS AT THE WESTERN END OF A WEAKENING FRONTAL
TROUGH EXTENDING ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA AND THE GULF OF MEXICO...
AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE MID/UPPER ANTICYCLONE MOVING
EASTWARD ACROSS TEXAS...LOUISIANA...AND THE NORTHWEST GULF. THE
LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE INDICATES THE ANTICYCLONE SHOULD CONTINUE
EASTWARD...ALLOWING THE CYCLONE TO TURN NORTH AFTER 36 TO 48 HOURS.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS THIS AND IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE AFTER THE RE-LOCATION IS ACCOUNTED FOR. AN
ALTERNATE SCENARIO IS THAT THE RIDGE MAY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DRIVE
THE SYSTEM INTO THE MEXICAN COAST BEFORE ANY TURN CAN OCCUR. THE
POSSIBILITY OF THIS INCREASES IF THE CENTER IS FARTHER WEST THAN
CURRENTLY THOUGHT.

WHILE THE ASSOCIATED CONVECTION IS DISORGANIZED...THE CLOUD TOPS ARE
TO -80C AND THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS APPEAR GENERALLY FAVORABLE. IF THE
CYCLONE STAYS OFFSHORE...AND IF IT CAN BETTER SEPARATE ITSELF FROM
THE GULF SURFACE TROUGH...IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTENSIFY. SOME
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AFTER 36 HR ON THE PREMISE THAT BOTH OF
THOSE IFS WILL OCCUR.

THE STRONGEST CONVECTION REMAINS WEST OF THE CENTER...OVER EASTERN
MEXICO BETWEEN VERACRUZ AND TAMPICO. HEAVY RAINS SHOULD PERSIST OVER
PORTIONS OF EASTERN MEXICO UNTIL THE DEPRESSION EITHER MOVES AWAY OR
DISSIPATES.

THE AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER INVESTIGATING THE SYSTEM COULD NOT
FIND A CENTER. INSTEAD THERE APPEAR TO BE SMALL VORTICITY MAXIMA
ALONG A BROAD TROUGH WITH A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 1008 MB. BASED ON
THIS...THE DEPRESSION WILL BE DECLARED DISSIPATED.

DESPITE THE LACK OF A CENTER...WINDS HAVE INCREASED CONSIDERABLY
OVER THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE FORMER CIRCULATION. SHIP PGEC HAS
REPORTED 40-48 KT WINDS SINCE 12Z...AND THE AIRCRAFT FOUND FLIGHT
LEVEL WINDS AS HIGH AS 50 KT NEAR 20N 96W. THUS...GALE WARNINGS ARE
BEING ISSUED IN OFFSHORE FORECASTS FROM THE SLIDELL NWSFO AND IN
HIGH SEAS FORECASTS FROM TAFB.

THE SYSTEM IS STILL GENERATING CONVECTION...AND HEAVY FLOOD-
PRODUCING RAINS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE OVER PORTIONS OF EASTERN
MEXICO.

ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...THE SYSTEM WILL BE CLOSELY
MONITORED IN CASE REGENERATION OCCURS. THIS COULD HAPPEN IF THE

THE LATEST SSM/I PASS FROM THE DMSP SATELLITE SUPPLIED BY THE NAVAL
RESEARCH LABORATORY IN MONTEREY CALIFORNIA SHOWS SUGGESTS THAT THE
CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE IS A BIT FURTHER NORTH THAN
EARLIER ESTIMATES...MULTICHANNEL GOES-8 IMAGERY ALSO SUPPORTS THIS.
AS ALWAYS...ONE MUST BE CAUTIOUS WHEN USING IR-BASED IMAGERY TO RE-
POSITION SYSTEM CENTERS AT NIGHT.  THE 06Z POSITION HAS BEEN NUDGED
NORTHWARD HOWEVER...WE WILL WAIT FOR VISIBLE IMAGERY BEFORE MAKING
FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS. IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IF THE CENTER NEEDS
TO BE ADJUSTED FURTHER NORTH ON THE NEXT PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/07 KNOTS. THE DEPRESSION IS ON
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WITH A TROUGH TO THE
NORTH AND WEST...PER WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.  THIS TROUGH MAY INDUCE
A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK IN THE SHORT TERM BUT THE GLOBAL MODELS
DEVELOP A RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT FEW
DAYS.   THIS MAY TURN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE BACK TO A MORE WEST-
NORTHWEST HEADING BY 72 HOURS.  THIS SCENARIO WOULD MINIMIZE THE
THREAT TO THE LESSER ANTILLES.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK 
IS ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH BAMM AND A98E...ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY FASTER. 

THE CENTER OF DEPRESSION TWELVE IS ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION...WHICH IS RATHER LINEAR IN NATURE.  SATELLITE IMAGERY
AND CLOUD DRIFT WINDS FROM CIMSS/UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SHOW THAT
THE SYSTEM IS EXPERIENCING SOME SOUTHERLY SHEAR. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 30 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY. THE
STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...SHOWS
A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING TREND SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH
IN 12 HOURS OR SO. HOWEVER...SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR AHEAD OF THE

SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE HAS
CHANGED LITTLE IN ORGANIZATION OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...WITH THE

CONVECTION. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 35
KT AND 30 KT RESPECTIVELY. WITH THE SOMEWHAT RAGGED APPEARANCE OF
THE CONVECTION...THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 30 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/6. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A
LOW LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION...WITH WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATING A LARGE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NORTH OF 20N BETWEEN 40W-50W.
LARGE SCALE AND NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE RESPONDS TO THIS BY
INDICATING A WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS THIS...BUT IS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF
THE GUIDANCE IN RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT MOTION. THE FORECAST TRACK
IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE BAMS.

ALTHOUGH CIRRUS CLOUD MOTIONS INDICATE AN ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
CONVECTION...THE SYSTEM HAS A SHEARED APPEARANCE. IT MAY BE THAT
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW IS UNDERCUTTING THE ANTICYCLONE. THE AVN AND
NOGAPS INDICATE THAT A RIDGE OR ANTICYCLONE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE
TROPICAL ATLANTIC AND DECREASE THE SHEAR. HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SUGGESTS THE TROUGH NORTH OF THE CYCLONE IS STRONGER AND
FARTHER SOUTH THAN EITHER MODEL...WHICH MEANS IT MAY NOT DISSIPATE

WIND SHEAR.  DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB
ARE 35 KT AND 30 KT...RESPECTIVELY.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE
HELD AT 30 KT.
 
THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS BEST IDENTIFIED IN GOES-8 MULTICHANNEL
SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/05.
THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN AND THE OBJECTIVE MODEL GUIDANCE REMAINS 
RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM THE LAST PACKAGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK SHOWS A SLOW...GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HRS

LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BASED MAINLY ON THE

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF TROPICAL
DEPRESSION TWELVE DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS.  THE CENTER REMAINS
EXPOSED WEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION DUE TO PERSISTENT SHEAR.  DVORAK
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN AT 35 KT AND
30 KT RESPECTIVELY. THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN 30 KT.

VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWS THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS A LITTLE FARTHER EAST
THAN INDICATED DURING THE NIGHT...SO THERE IS A SLIGHT RELOCATION OF
THE INITIAL POSITION. THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/3. WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL LOW CENTERED NEAR
26N45W...MOVING SLOWLY EAST. VISIBLE IMAGERY AND SHIP REPORTS
SUGGESTS THAT THE LOW HAS CREATED A WEAKNESS IN THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE
NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION...LEAVING IT IN VERY WEAK STEERING FLOW. THE
UKMET MODEL...WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE THE BEST HANDLE ON THE UPPER
LOW...INDICATES IT WILL BE 24 TO 36 HOURS BEFORE THE LOW WEAKENS AND
MOVES FAR ENOUGH TO THE EAST FOR ITS INFLUENCE ON THE DEPRESSION TO
DIMINISH. ACCORDINGLY...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK CONTINUES THE
SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION FOR 36 HOURS...WITH SOME INCREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED AFTER THAT.

CIRRUS CLOUD MOTIONS SHOW AN ANTICYCLONE OVER THE DEPRESSION.
HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CLEARLY SHOWS WEST-SOUTHWEST FLOW
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW UNDERCUTTING THE ANTICYCLONE AND
CAUSING SHEAR. THE UKMET...AVN...AND NOGAPS ALL INDICATE THE SHEAR
SHOULD DIMINISH AFTER 24 TO 36 HOURS...WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE
STRENGTHENING INDICATED IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST. GIVEN THE MODELS
TRACK RECORD ON FORECASTING THE SHEAR AFFECTING THIS SYSTEM... IT

TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE DISCUSSION NUMBER   8
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT THU OCT 07 1999
 
CONVECTION HAS DECREASED WITH TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE DURING THE
AFTERNOON...LEAVING AN EXPOSED LOW CLOUD SWIRL WITH WIDELY SCATTERED
CONVECTION WELL NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER. SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 30 KT...SO THAT IS THE
INITIAL INTENSITY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/4. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN EITHER THE
SYNOPTIC PATTERN OR THE FORECAST REASONING FROM THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE. THE CYCLONE SHOULD CONTINUE SLOWLY WEST-NORTHWEST UNDER A
WEAKENED SUBTROPICAL RIDGE FOR 24 TO 36 HOURS...FOLLOWED BY A
GRADUAL INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
LITTLE CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THAT WESTERLY FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE
UPPER LEVEL LOW/TROUGH NORTH OF THE CYCLONE CONTINUES TO SHEAR THE
DEPRESSION. THE AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS INDICATE THE TROUGH WILL
WEAKEN AND MOVE EASTWARD AFTER 12-24 HOURS. THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY
THE IMAGERY...WHICH SUGGESTS THE TROUGH IS STILL DIGGING SOUTH
TOWARD THE CYCLONE. THE INTENSITY FORECAST DELAYS INTENSIFICATION
EVEN MORE THAN PREVIOUSLY IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE SHEAR WILL NOT
DECREASE AS QUICKLY AS EARLIER FORECAST. EVEN THOUGH THE CYCLONE HAS
A LARGE CIRCULATION...THE ENVIRONMENT MAY STAY HOSTILE LONG ENOUGH
FOR IT TO WEAKEN OR DISSIPATE BEFORE THE SHEAR RELAXES.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE DISCUSSION NUMBER   9
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT THU OCT 07 1999
 
THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION CONSISTS OF A LARGE CIRCULATION OF LOW
CLOUDS WITH A FEW PATCHES OF DEEP CONVECTION TO THE EAST AND WELL
REMOVED FROM THE CENTER.  THERE ARE NO SIGNS THAT THE SOUTHWESTERLY
SHEAR IS RELAXING...AND IN FACT...IT LOOKS STRONGER THAN EARLIER
TODAY.  STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW PREVAILS FROM THE EASTERN
CARIBBEAN TO A STRONG UPPER-LOW JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION.
IN ADDITION... THE OUTFLOW FROM THE FOLLOWING TROPICAL WAVE
APPRACHING FROM THE EAST WILL LIKELY AFFECT THE DEPRESSION BY
INCREASING THE SHEAR.  ON THE OTHER HAND...ALL AVAILABLE GLOBAL
MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE SHEAR IS GOING TO DECREASE...AS THE UPPER-
LOW MOVES NORTHEASTWARD WHILE SHIPS MODEL STRENGTHENS THE DEPRESSION
TO HURRICANE STATUS. I NORMALLY FOLLOW SHIPS AND GLOBAL MODELS...
WHICH HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD THIS SEASON. IN THIS CASE...HOWEVER...I DO
NOT SEE HOW SUCH A SHEARED DEPRESSION CAN RECOVER FROM THE
PREVAILING HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT.  AT THIS TIME...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST KEEPS A 30-KNOT DEPRESSION THROUGH 72 HOURS BUT I WOULD NOT
BE SURPRISED...IF THIS DEPRESSION DISSIPATES IN 24 HOUR OR SO.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 300/04. MODELS AND THE OFFCIAL FORECAST ARE IN
GOOD AGREEMENT IN MOVING THE DEPRESSION SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST-
NORTHWEST THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WEAK
STEERING FLOW WHICH IS FORECAST TO PREVAIL IN THE AREA.

THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE
REMAINS SPARSE...POORLY ORGANIZED AND WELL-REMOVED FROM THE CENTER.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 30 KT.
 
THE MULTICHANNEL GOES-8 IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER OF THE
DEPRESSION IS NOT VERY WELL-DEFINED. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE
IS 300/3.  THE SYSTEM IS DRIFTING WEST-NORTHWEST AROUND THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF THE LOW-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
CONTINUES THIS GENERAL MOTION THROUGH 72 HRS WITH A GRADUAL INCREASE
IN FORWARD SPEED AFTER 36 HRS.  THIS FORECAST IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WITH BAMS...ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY SLOWER...AND IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
THE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO FEEL THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF WESTERLY/
SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONG 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH/LOW SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY NORTH OF THE
DEPRESSION.  THE SHEAR HAS BEEN PERSISTENT CONTRARY TO THE FORECASTS
BY THE GLOBAL MODELS. IN FACT...THE TROUGH HAS SHIFTED SOUTHWARD
OVER THE LAST 24 HRS.  BOTH THE AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS CONTINUE TO
INDICATE THAT THE TROUGH WILL WEAKEN AND SHIFT EASTWARD WITHIN 
24 HRS OR SO THEREBY LESSENING THE SHEAR. CURRENT SATELLITE TRENDS
SUGGEST THAT THIS MAY NOT OCCUR AS QUICKLY AS FORECAST. FURTHERMORE
...THE OUTFLOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPROACHING TROPICAL WAVE NEAR
33W/34W WILL LIKELY INCREASE THE SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE. SO... UNTIL
THERE ARE SIGNS OF THE SHEAR ABATING...THE SYSTEM WILL BE MAINTAINED
AS A DEPRESSION THROUGH 72 HRS.
 
DESPITE THE LARGE NATURE OF THE CIRCULATION THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT
MAY PERSIST LONG ENOUGH THAT THE SYSTEM MAY NOT RECOVER AND COULD
WEAKEN OR DISSIPATE BEFORE THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...PERHAPS
WITHIN 24 HRS OR SO.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE REMAINS AN EXPOSED LOW-LEVEL CLOUD
SWIRL...BUT WITH A FLARE-UP OF CONVECTION THIS MORNING...IT HAS
BOUGHT ITSELF AT LEAST ANOTHER 6-12 HOURS OF EXISTENCE.  THE
DEPRESSION REMAINS UNDER SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR
ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGE UPPER TROUGH TO ITS NORTH AND WEST. 
ALTHOUGH GLOBAL MODELS FORECAST THIS SHEAR TO LESSEN...WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE TROUGH IS STILL DIGGING SOUTHWARD AHEAD OF
THE DEPRESSION.  IN ADDITION...THE TROPICAL WAVE EAST OF THE
DEPRESSION HAS A HEALTHY OUTFLOW THAT MAY KEEP SHEAR VALUES HIGH. 
THESE FACTORS ARE EXPECTED TO LIMIT ANY SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.

THE DEPRESSION HAS MOVED LITTLE THIS MORNING AND THE INITIAL MOTION
IS STATIONARY.  MOST MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS THE DEPRESSION MOVING
GENERALLY NORTHWESTWARD TOWARD A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ON THE LEFT EDGE OF THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE
ASSUMING SHALLOW LAYER STEERING...AND RESUMES A WEST-NORTHWESTERLY

SATELLITE IMAGES AND RAOB OBSERVATIONS FROM GRAND CAYMAN INDICATE
THAT THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN HAS BECOME
MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED AND IS NOW TROPICAL STORM IRENE. A
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE WILL PROVIDE BETTER INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION
AND THE INTENSITY OF IRENE LATER TODAY.  THE AREA OF SHOWERS AND
SQUALLS COVERS A LARGE AREA OF WESTERN CARIBBEAN AND THE OUTFLOW IS
EXCELLENT. CONVENTIONAL TOOLS INDICATE THAT IRENE COULD REACH
HURRICANE STATUS IN ABOUT 36 HOURS.  SHIPS AND GFDL MODELS ALSO
SUGGEST STRENGTHENING. 

INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN SINCE IRENE IS IN ITS FORMATIVE STAGE
BUT BEST ESTIMATE IS 345/7. IRENE SHOULD MOVE ON A GENERAL SLOW
NORTH NORTHWEST AND THEN NORTHWARD TRACK TROUGH 48 HOURS. 
THEREAFTER...AN UPPER TROUGH IS FORECAST TO APPROACH THE
NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND IRENE COULD TURN TOWARD THE NORTH-
NORTHEAST AND ACCELERATE. THIS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL AND UK
MODELS AND CLIMATOLOGY. WATCHES AND WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ISSUED

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
IRENE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE WITH EXCELLENT OUTFLOW...PLENTY OF
DEEP CONVECTION AND BANDING FEATURES. T-NUMBER FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE
3.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE.  HOWEVER...DATA FROM A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE
INDICATE THAT IRENE IS STILL POORLY ORGANIZED WITH TROPICAL STORM
FORCE WINDS...45 TO 50 KNOTS...LIMITED TO AN AREA WITHIN A BAND TO
THE NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  MINIMUM PRESSURE IS 1002 MB.  THE
ENVIRONMENT IS FORECAST TO BE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING AND THERE
IS A WARM UPPER OCEANIC MIXED LAYER (FANCY FOR A WARM OCEAN) AHEAD
OF THE STORM.  THEREFORE...IRENE IS FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 355/8.  IRENE SHOULD CONTINUE
ON THIS GENERAL TRACK...PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT SLOWER...DURING THE
NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH NORTHEAST
THEREAFTER.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WEAKENING OF THE STEERING
FLOW AS THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH WEAKENS. THE NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD TURN
WILL RESULT FROM A NEW TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO MOVE EASTWARD

AIR FORCE RECON FOUND 56 KNOTS OVER THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT SEVERAL
HOURS AGO.  THE PRESENTATION ON SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO LOOK
MORE IMPRESSIVE.  LATEST SATELLITE-DERIVED INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE
3.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...I.E. 55 KNOTS.  THERE IS EXCELLENT UPPER-
LEVEL OUTFLOW OVER THE STORM AND THE WATERS ARE QUITE WARM.  IRENE
IS LIKELY TO INTENSIFY INTO A HURRICANE IN 12 HOURS...ABOUT THE TIME
IT REACHES WESTERN CUBA.  ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS PREDICTED OVER
THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO.  HOWEVER INCREASING UPPER-LEVEL
SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS MAY LIMIT INTENSIFICATION LATER IN THE FORECAST
PERIOD.

A WELL-DEFINED MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES
IS APPROACHING THE U.S. EAST COAST...AND CURRENTLY PASSING THE
LONGITUDE OF IRENE.  AS THIS FEATURE BYPASSES THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
AND MOVES ON OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC...THE STEERING CURRENT NEAR IRENE
SHOULD WEAKEN.  HENCE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SLOWS THE FORWARD SPEED
DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...A
NEW MIDLATITUDE TROUGH...WHICH IS CURRENTLY OVER NORTHWESTERN NORTH
AMERICA...IS EXPECTED TO DROP INTO THE MIDWEST.  THIS SHOULD PRODUCE
A SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING FLOW FOR IRENE.  HOWEVER THERE IS
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST LATER IN THE PERIOD AS
REFLECTED BY THE SPREAD OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS.  FOR EXAMPLE
THE U.K. MET. OFFICE MODEL KEEPS IRENE OVER THE EASTERN GULF THROUGH
72 HOURS BUT THE NAVY VERSION OF THE GFDL MODEL ACCELERATES THE
CYCLONE INTO EASTERN GEORGIA BY THAT TIME.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
A REASONABLE BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE...AND IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THAT

SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB SUGGEST THE CENTER
HAS MOVED SLIGHTLY WEST OF DUE NORTH AND HAS SLOWED DOWN A BIT.
ALTHOUGH THE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS UNABLE TO FLY NEAR THE
COAST OF CUBA DUE TO AIR FORCE REGULATIONS...THEY WERE ABLE TO
USE THE ON-BOARD RADAR TO ESTIMATE A CENTER.  THEIR ESTIMATE IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE SATELLITE TRENDS...AND THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS NOW 355/6 KT.  

WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE 
U.S. EAST COAST THE STEERING CURRENTS NEAR IRENE SHOULD WEAKEN. 
MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE IS IN AGREEMENT WITH A SLOW
GENERALLY NORTHWARD MOTION THROUGH 24-36 HRS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST 
SHOWS A SLOW GENERAL NORTHWARD SPEED DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO. 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...A NEW MID-LATITUDE TROUGH
...CURRENTLY OVER NORTHWESTERN NORTH AMERICA...IS EXPECTED TO MOVE
INTO THE MIDWEST.  THIS SHOULD PRODUCE A SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY
STEERING ENVIRONMENT FOR IRENE.  SEVERAL MODELS...BAMD...THE GFDL
AND UKMET...SHOW A NORTH-NORTHEAST TURN AND AN INCREASE IN SPEED 
BETWEEN 48 AND 72 HRS.  WHILE THE GUIDANCE IS MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED
ON THIS SCENARIO...THERE REMAINS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THIS
PORTION OF THE FORECAST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY
TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN
THE UKMET AND GFDL GUIDANCE LATER IN THE PERIOD. 
 
IRENE CONTINUES TO HAVE AN IMPRESSIVE SATELLITE SIGNATURE WITH THE
CENTER EMBEDDED WITHIN VERY COLD CONVECTION...TOPS TO -80C. BASED 
ON SATELLITE-BASED DVORAK ESTIMATES...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS NOW
65 KT MAKING IRENE A HURRICANE. THE WESTERN PORTION OF CUBA IS
RATHER FLAT AND NARROW...AND HISTORICALLY HAS HAD MINIMAL IMPACT 
ON THE INTENSITY OF TROPICAL CYCLONES WHICH CROSS OVER THE REGION.
WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW AND WARM WATERS FURTHER
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...IN
AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS. HOWEVER INCREASING UPPER-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY
WINDS MAY LIMIT INTENSIFICATION LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT THU OCT 14 1999
...VERY SLIGHT CORRECTION TO 12 HR FORECAST POSITION... 
IRENE IS POSING SOME FORECASTING CHALLENGES THIS EVENING.  A FEW
HOURS AGO...USING MORE RELIABLE CENTER FIXES FROM THE NOAA
AIRCRAFT...THE CENTER WAS RELOCATED SOMEWHAT TO THE WEST OF THE
PREVIOUS TRACK.  THIS WAS ALSO INDICATED BY KEY WEST RADAR...WHEN
THE EYE APPEARED TO REFORM IN THE VICINITY OF HAVANA.  MORE
RECENTLY...HOWEVER...THE RADAR PRESENTATION HAS DETERIORATED
MARKEDLY...AND THE LATEST FIXES FROM THE NOAA PLANE SHOW A SLOW AND
ERRATIC MOVEMENT.  HOWEVER...IRENE IS EXPECTED TO RESUME A NORTHWARD
COURSE AT AROUND 7 KNOTS.  THE RE-POSITIONING OF THE CENTER REQUIRES
A WESTWARD SHIFT OF THE FORECAST TRACK.  MID-TROPOSPHERIC HEIGHTS
ARE FORECAST TO RISE TO THE EAST OF FLORIDA AS A BROAD TROUGH MOVES
INTO THE CENTER PART OF THE U.S.  THIS SHOULD STEER IRENE NORTHWARD
SLOWLY FOR A DAY OR SO...WITH A GRADUAL BEND TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST AT A SLIGHTLY FASTER FORWARD SPEED LATER IN THE
PERIOD.  THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST TRACK IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH
THE U.K. MET. OFFICE AND LBAR GUIDANCE.
 
NOW THE OTHER CHALLENGE...FORECASTING THE INTENSITY.  IN SPITE OF
THE CURRENT RAGGEDNESS OF THE SYSTEM...WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE
IS A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR STRENGTHENING AS IRENE MOVES OVER THE
SOUTHEASTERN GULF.  THUS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A SLIGHT
INCREASE IN STRENGTH...IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS MODEL
GUIDANCE.  HOWEVER...INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR COULD BE AN
INHIBITING FACTOR.
 
THE CURRENT FORECAST REQUIRES A NORTHWARD EXTENSION OF THE WATCHES
AND WARNINGS.

...CORRECT ARE TO WINDS IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH...
 
WSR-88D DATA FROM KEY WEST AND REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE
HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATE THE CENTER OF IRENE RE-FORMED TO
THE EAST EARLY THIS MORNING...AS THE CYCLONE RESUMED A NORTHWARD
MOTION. SATELLITE CLOUD TOPS HAVE BEEN AS COLD AS -89C...AND A RADAR
EYE HAS BEEN COMING AND GOING. THE AIRCRAFT DID REPORT 85 KT FLIGHT
LEVEL WINDS WELL EAST OF THE CENTER...BUT THESE WINDS MAY HAVE BEEN
ASSOCIATED WITH A MESOCYCLONE IN AN OUTER BAND. THE MAXIMUM WINDS
REMAIN AT 65 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE...BUT THE GUSTS WILL BE RAISED TO
85 KT BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT DATA.

ALTHOUGH IRENE IS MOVING IN FITS AND STARTS...THE INITIAL MOTION IS
ESTIMATED TO BE 360/8. THE HURRICANE IS IN A WEAKNESS BETWEEN TWO
PARTS OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE...WITH THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE
RIDGE BEING SLIGHTLY STRONGER. THIS IS EXPECTED TO KEEP IRENE ON A
GENERALLY NORTHWARD TRACK THROUGH 36 TO 48 HOURS. THEREAFTER...A
DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. SHOULD PRODUCE A GRADUAL
TURN TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST AND A FASTER FORWARD MOTION. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS IN AGREEMENT WITH MOST FORECAST GUIDANCE.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS STILL QUITE CHALLENGING. ALTHOUGH THE
RADAR EYE IS CURRENTLY WEAKENING...AND IRENE SHOWS SOME SIGNS OF
SHEARING...THE CONVECTIVE TOPS ARE QUITE COLD AND THE NORTHWARD
MOTION MAY REDUCE THE STORM-RELATIVE SHEAR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST
WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR A SLIGHT STRENGTHENING...WHICH KEEPS IRENE
A CATEGORY ONE HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE UNTIL LANDFALL.
SLOW WEAKENING IS FORECAST THEREAFTER. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IRENE
IS VERY ASYMMETRICAL...WITH MOST OF THE CONVECTION OVER THE EASTERN
SEMICIRCLE.
 
THE CURRENT FORECAST REQUIRES A NORTHWARD EXTENSION OF THE HURRICANE
WATCH AND TROPICAL STORM WARNING ALONG THE FLORIDA EAST COAST.

...CORRECTION TO INDICATE THAT THE 48 HOUR POSITION IS NOT INLAND...

RECONNAISSANCE FIXES AND RADAR IMAGERY FROM THE KEY WEST RADAR
INDICATE THAT IRENE HAS BEEN MOVING AT AN AVERAGE TRACK OF 020/7
OVER THE LAST 6-12 HOURS.  SUPERIMPOSED ON THIS MEAN MOTION HAVE
BEEN BRIEF PERIODS OF STATIONARITY AND ABRUPT JUMPS.  WITH THIS
CONTINUED NET NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD TRACK...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE EAST.  ADDITIONAL WOBBLES IN THE PATH OF
IRENE ARE LIKELY PRIOR TO LANDFALL.  ON THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK...LANDFALL WILL OCCUR SOONER...WITHIN 12-18 HOURS.  LONGER
TERM...A MAJOR TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN
STATES AND ACCELERATE THE CYCLONE NORTHEASTWARD CLOSE TO THE COASTS
OF NORTHEAST FLORIDA...GEORGIA...AND SOUTH CAROLINA.

A RECENT RECONNAISSANCE REPORT OF 74 KNOTS AT 850 MB SUPPORTS AN
INTENSITY OF 65 KTS.  HOWEVER...THE SATELLITE DEPICTION HAS IMPROVED
SIGNIFICANTLY THIS MORNING...WITH VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS...AND A BIT
OF OUTFLOW HAS RETURNED TO THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  SOME
STRENTHENING IS EXPECTED PRIOR TO LANDFALL...BUT GIVEN THE POOR
ORGANIZATION OF THE INNER CORE...RAPID INTENSIFICATION OVER THE NEXT
12 HOURS SEEMS UNLIKELY.  IF THE HURRICANE TAKES ANOTHER JOG TO THE
NORTH HOWEVER...THIS WOULD DELAY LANDFALL AND ALLOW ADDITIONAL
STRENGTHENING.

THE CENTER OF IRENE CAME ASHORE OVER CAPE SABLE EARLIER THIS
AFTERNOON.  LATEST RECONNAISSANCE FIXES AND RADAR IMAGERY INDICATES
THAT THE MOTION IS 030/10.  MOST GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT IRENE WILL
TURN MORE TO THE NORTH OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS BEFORE ACCELERATING

HURRICANE FORCE WINDS ARE CONFINED TO A FEW SQUALLS OFFSHORE THE

LEVEL WINDS OF 93 KT.  THE LAST PRESSURE MEASURED BY DROPSONDE IN
THE CENTER WAS 985 MB...ALTHOUGH THE MOST RECENT EXTRAPOLATED

IN SPITE OF NUMERICAL GUIDANCE WHICH INDICATED A MORE NORTHWARD
TRACK...KEEPING THE CENTER OVER LAND...IRENE HAS CONTINUED MOVING
NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD.  IF THIS MOTION CONTINUES FOR A FEW MORE
HOURS...THE CENTER WILL EMERGE OVER THE ATLANTIC EARLY SATURDAY.
THE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO LOOK HEALTHY AS IT MOVES OVER THE FLAT

HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THESE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS HAVE BEEN...AND

WSR-88D DATA FROM MELBOURNE INDICATE THE IRREGULAR EYE OF IRENE IS
STRADDLING THE FLORIDA COAST JUST SOUTHEAST OF FT. PIERCE. THE
PASSAGE ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA MAY HAVE TAKEN A TOLL ON THE SYSTEM...
AS CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES NEAR THE SYSTEM HAVE WARMED SOMEWHAT
DURING THE NIGHT. HOWEVER...THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
HAS JUST REPORTED A 986 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE AND 77 KT WINDS NORTH OF
THE CENTER AT 850 MB. ALSO...SHIP ELUB8 REPORTED 65 KT WINDS EAST OF
FT. LAUDERDALE AT 03Z. THUS... HURRICANE STATUS IS MAINTAINED FOR
THIS PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 020/9...ALTHOUGH THE RADAR DATA SUGGESTS A
NORTHWARD WOBBLE IS IN PROGRESS. A STRONG MID LEVEL RIDGE EAST OF
IRENE SEEMS TO BE CAUSING THE LONG ANTICIPATED MORE NORTHERLY
MOTION. A COASTAL TROUGH IS FORMING NEAR THE CAROLINA COAST...AND
THIS MAY BE THE WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE THAT ALLOWS THIS TRACK TO
CONTINUE. HOWEVER...THERE ARE SOME CONFLICTING SIGNALS. FIRST...THE
LARGE CIRRUS PLUME EXTENDING NORTHEAST FROM THE HURRICANE SUGGESTS A
CONTINUED NORTHEASTWARD COMPONENT. SECOND...THE MODEL GUIDANCE
INDICATES A NORTHERLY MOTION...WITH THE GFDL TAKING THE SYSTEM TO
NEAR CHARLESTON SC BY 18/06Z. THE MODEL GUIDANCE HAS SHOWN A
DISTINCT LEFT BIAS DURING THIS STORM...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL
BE SIMILAR...BUT A LITTLE EAST...OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
WITH THE CURRENT RADAR PRESENTATION AND ANTICIPATED MOTION OVER THE
GULF STREAM...IRENE COULD INTENSIFY AS THE CENTER MOVES OVER OPEN
WATER. HOWEVER...THE CURRENT MORE NORTHWARD COULD ALSO RESULT IN
INCREASED SHEAR...ESPECIALLY NEAR THE 36 AND 48 HR FORECASTS. THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST MAINTAINS IRENE AS A 65 KT HURRICANE
THROUGH 36 HOURS...ALTHOUGH SOME FLUCTUATIONS COULD OCCUR. IRENE
SHOULD INTERACT WITH THE WESTERLIES AND BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY THE
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
THE CURRENT FORECAST TRACK REQUIRES A HURRICANE WATCH ALONG PARTS OF
THE NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA COASTS...AND EXTENDING THE TROPICAL
STORM WARNINGS NORTHWARD ALONG THE GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA
COASTS.

WHILE A BURST OF STRONG CONVECTION HAS OCCURRED NEAR THE CENTER OF
IRENE OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...IT IS NOW WEAKENING AND BOTH THE
RADAR AND SATELLITE PRESENTATIONS REMAIN UNIMPRESSIVE.  HOWEVER...
THE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT RECENTLY REPORTED 850 MB WINDS AS
HIGH AS 71 KT AND A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 982 MB. IT IS LIKELY
THE DRY AIR SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SOUTH AND WEST OF IRENE IS
ENTRAINING INTO THE HURRICANE AND SUPPRESSING THE CONVECTION. THE
INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 65 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 360/08. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A TROUGH
OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. HEADING FOR IRENE...ALONG WITH THE ASSOCIATED
COLD FRONT SEEN ON SURFACE ANALYSES. A BROAD EASTWARD-MOVING RIDGE
IS EVIDENT IN THE IMAGERY WITH AN AXIS ALONG 70W. THIS COMBINATION
OF FEATURES SHOULD GRADUALLY TURN IRENE TO THE NORTHEAST WITH
ACCELERATION OVER THE NEXT 36 HR. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
REFLECTS THIS AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MODEL GUIDANCE. THERE
ARE DISAGREEMENTS IN THE LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE AS TO THE EVENTUAL
FATE OF IRENE NEAR THE 36-48 HR FORECASTS.  THE ECMWF...UKMET...
AND ENVIRONMENT CANADA GLOBAL MODEL TRANSFORM IRENE INTO A LARGE 
AND VICIOUS EXTRATROPICAL LOW...WHILE THE AVN...NOGAPS...AND ETA
FAVOR A WEAKER AND MORE SHEARED OUT SOLUTION. THE NHC TRACK AND
INTENSITY FORECASTS ASSUME THE STRONGER SCENARIO.

ALTHOUGH IRENE SHOULD PASS ACROSS THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE GULF
STREAM BEFORE LANDFALL...THE LACK OF ORGANIZATION SHOULD LIKELY
PREVENT SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING. A COMBINATION OF LAND INTERACTION
...INCREASING SHEAR...AND COLDER AIR AND WATER SHOULD CAUSE IRENE 
TO WEAKEN AFTER LANDFALL. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR LITTLE

IRENE CONTINUES TO GENERATE JUST ENOUGH DEEP CONVECTION TO MAINTAIN
MINIMAL HURRICANE STATUS.   THE MOST RECENT PEAK WINDS FROM THE
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WERE 68 KNOTS...BUT THE AIRCRAFT HAS NOT YET 
SAMPLED THE CONVECTIVE BURST TO THE NORTH OF THE CENTER.  IRENE IS
LIKELY TO MAINTAIN MINIMAL HURRICANE STATUS UNTIL LANDFALL.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 005/9. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A TROUGH
OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. HEADING FOR IRENE...ALONG WITH THE ASSOCIATED
COLD FRONT SEEN ON SURFACE ANALYSES. A BROAD EASTWARD-MOVING RIDGE
IS EVIDENT IN THE IMAGERY WITH AN AXIS NEAR 70W.  AS THE CENTER
APPROACHES THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST THIS AFTERNOON...THE PATH SHOULD
GRADUALLY DEFLECT TO THE RIGHT.  THE CENTER IS LIKELY TO TRACK VERY
CLOSE TO THE COAST FROM CENTRAL SOUTH CAROLINA NORTHEASTWARD TO NEAR
CAPE HATTERAS...AND THE STRONGEST WINDS AT LANDFALL COULD OCCUR
ANYWHERE IN THIS INTERVAL.  

RAINFALL ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN INCREASED...TO 4 TO 8 INCHES OF
ADDITIONAL RAINFALL...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS.  THESE RAINS ARE 
BE FALLING ON ALREADY SATURATED GROUND AND ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
SERIOUS FLOODING.

THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE AND TRACK OF
IRENE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  AN INTENSE BURST OF CONVECTION
LATE THIS MORNING WAS FOLLOWED BY A DROP IN MINIMUM PRESSURE...AN
IMPROVED RADAR DEPICTION AND A CONTRACTION OF THE RADIUS OF MAXIMUM
WINDS.    THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN INCREASE IN WINDS YET...AND THE
PROXIMITY TO LAND SHOULD LIMIT ANY INTENSIFICATION.
 
RADAR AND RECONNAISSANCE FIXES INDICATE THAT IRENE HAS STARTED TO
MAKE THE ANTICIPATED RIGHTWARD TURN...WITH AN INITIAL MOTION OF
040/12.  THE CENTER IS LIKELY TO TRACK VERY CLOSE TO THE NORTH
CAROLINA COAST...BUT IF THIS NORTHEASTWARD MOTION CONTINUES...THE

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF IRENE HAVE CONTINUED WITH
THE CENTER BECOMING WELL DEFINED AND SOME DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE
COMPACT CENTER.  THIS IS CONFIRMED BY THE RETURN OF MOIST AIR TO THE
CENTER OF THE STORM AS MEASURED BY AIR FORCE RECON.  DEW POINTS AT
850 MB ARE NOW 20C...ABOUT 10C HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY.  THE
EXTRAPOLATED PRESSURE HAS ALSO DECREASED TO 973 MB.  HURRICANE FORCE
WINDS ARE STILL LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE CENTER.
 
RADAR AND RECONNAISSANCE FIXES INDICATE THAT IRENE HAS CONTINUED THE
NORTHEAST MOTION AND IS ACCELERATING.  INITIAL MOTION IS 060/20. 
THIS MOTION LESSENS THE THREAT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST...AND IS
THE REASON FOR DOWNGRADING TO TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS.  TRACK
GUIDANCE ACCELERATES THE SYSTEM TOWARD THE EAST-NORTHEAST AND THE
SYSTEM SHOULD BECOME EXTRATROPICAL IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.

BIG SURPRISE! AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER FOUND A TIGHT
WIND CENTER ASSOCIATED WITH THE CENTRAL CONVECTION OF IRENE. 850 MB
FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS WERE 114 KT JUST SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER...AND
129 KT WINDS WERE OBSERVED AT 902 MB ON AN EYEWALL DROPSONDE. THE
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS 958 MB. THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
INCREASED TO 90 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE...AND THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE
CONSERVATIVE. 

IRENE HAS ACCELERATED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS...AND THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOW 055/30. THERE IS LITTLE TO SAY WITH REGARDS TO TRACK
OR INTENSITY. IRENE SHOULD CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE TO THE NORTHEAST
AND EAST-NORTHEAST UNTIL EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION OCCURS IN 24
HOURS. THE INTENSITY FORECAST HAS BEEN ADJUSTED FOR THE CURRENT
INTENSITY.

INITIAL WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 050/35.  THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL AS
WELL AS OTHER GLOBAL MODELS SHOWS IRENE BEING ADVECTED NORTHEASTWARD
IN A FLOW OF AT LEAST 50 KNOTS IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THE GLOBAL

ALTHOUGH IRENE IS ALREADY SHOWING SOME EXTRATROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS
...THERE IS A SYMMETRIC AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER. 
THE WIND SPEED IS ASSUMED TO BE NEAR 90 KNOTS BASED ON DVORAK

5 PM EDT SUN OCT 17 1999

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER HAS
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND HAS DEVELOPED BANDING FEATURES...A BROAD
LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION AND AN EXCELLENT UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW.  SHIP
MTQU3...LOCATED NORTH OF THE DEVELOPING CENTER REPORTED 20-KNOT
EASTERLY WINDS AND 1006 MB PRESSURE.  THIS IS ENOUGH TO BEGIN
ADVISORIES ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOURTEEN.   BECAUSE THE DEPRESSION
IS IN THE FORMATIVE STAGE...THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS POORLY
ORGANIZED.  THIS MAY RESULT IN SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN BOTH INITIAL
POSITION AND LOCATION. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR STRENGTHENING
SINCE THERE WILL BE A LOW-SHEAR ENVIRONMENT AND SHIPS MODEL BRINGS
THE DEPRESSION TO A 75-KNOT HURRICANE BY 72 HOURS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BUT BEST ESTIMATE IS 275/10.
THERE IS A STRONG 500-MB RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING WESTWARD
OVER THE ATLANTIC. THIS SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH WESTWARD STEERING TO
BRING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE OVER THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN BY 72 HOURS.
THIS IS THE SOLUTION PRODUCED BY MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS EXCEPT
NOGAPS WHICH TURN THE SYSTEM NORTHWARD BEFORE REACHING THE LESSER
ANTILLES.  WITH THIS TRACK IN MIND...A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE
REQUIRED FOR PORTIONS OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS AS EARLY AS TONIGHT.

NOTE: GLOBAL MODELS ONCE AGAIN DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN FORECASTING

STORM STRENGTH.  UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW OVER THE CYCLONE
IS IMPRESSIVE AND A WESTERLY JET TO THE NORTHEAST IS LIKELY
ASSISTING THIS OUTFLOW.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME
AS THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND SHOWS HURRICANE INTENSITY BY 48 HOURS. 

AS IS TYPICAL FOR A SYSTEM IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT...THE
CENTER FIXES SHOW A LOT OF SCATTER.  MY ESTIMATE FOR INITIAL MOTION
IS 275/10.  NOT MUCH CHANGE IS MADE TO THE PREVIOUS TRACK FORECAST. 
GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH OVER THE SOUTHWEST

THE TROPICAL CYCLONE INTO THE EXTREME EASTERN CARIBBEAN BY THE END
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  A GRADUAL TURN TO THE RIGHT IS INDICATED BY
MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO THE U.K. MET. OFFICE MODEL AND THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL

PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AS A LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
ANTICYCLONE DEPICTED IN THE GLOBAL MODELS OVER THE SOUTHWEST NORTH
ATLANTIC SHOULD STEER JOSE ON A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH 12

SUBSTANTIAL UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM...CONTINUED
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  THE NAVY VERSION OF THE GFDL MODEL AND
THE AIR FORCE WEATHER AGENCY MESOSCALE MODEL BOTH SHOW
INTENSIFICATION DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS WELL.  JOSE SHOULD BE
NEARING HURRICANE STRENGTH IN A DAY OR SO.
 
SATELLITE-DERIVED POSITION ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN A BIT TO THE SOUTH OF
THE AIRCRAFT ONES.  MY LOCATION AND MOTION ESTIMATES ARE BIASED MORE
TOWARD THE RECON BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES IN SATELLITE
ESTIMATES.  CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/11.  OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL HOURS THERE HAS BEEN A TENDENCY FOR THE STORM TO MOVE MORE
TO THE RIGHT OF ITS PREVIOUS TRACK.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A
SMALL MID/UPPER LEVEL CYCLONIC VORTEX IN THE VICINITY OF 20N 60W.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS FEATURE COULD TURN THE STORM MORE
NORTHWESTWARD DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO.  MY FORECAST IS
SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK...BUT
ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION SUITE.
 
ADDITIONAL WATCHES FOR THE U.S. AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS AND
PUERTO RICO MAY BE REQUIRED TOMORROW.

JOSE HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED THIS EVENING WITH COLDER TOPS AND
INCREASED BANDING AROUND THE CENTER. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB AND SAB HAVE INCREASED TO 55 KT...WHICH WILL BE THE
INITIAL INTENSITY FOR THIS PACKAGE.

ALTHOUGH THE CENTER SEEMS TO HAVE JUMPED AROUND SOME DURING THE
NIGHT...THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 300/11. JOSE IS SOUTH OF
A LARGE RIDGE COVERING THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE
INDICATES THE RIDGE SHOULD CHANGE LITTLE OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS..WHICH SUGGESTS A CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT WEST-NORTHWEST
MOTION. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT WITH THE
SCENARIO. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE
GFDL...WHICH TURNS THE CYCLONE MORE TO THE NORTHWEST AFTER 48
HOURS...AND THE UKMET...WHICH TRACKS JOSE WEST-NORTHWEST ACROSS
PUERTO RICO.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES AN ANTICYCLONE OVER JOSE...WHICH
SHOULD ALLOW FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THE AVN...UKMET...AND NOGAPS ALL
FORECAST THIS ANTICYCLONE TO MOVE WEST-NORTHWEST WITH THE STORM...
WHICH COULD ALLOW IT TO BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE. HOWEVER...
THESE MODELS ALSO INDICATED SUCH AN ANTICYCLONE WOULD DEVELOP OVER
TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE...AND THAT FORECAST WAS A TOTAL BUST. THE
INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR MORE STRENGTHENING THAN THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE...BUT NOT TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS. IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE
SHIPS MODEL FORECASTS SIGNIFICANT SHEAR OVER JOSE AND ONLY BRINGS
IT TO 83 KT IN 72 HOURS.
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS HAVE BEEN REVISED BASED ON THE MOTION AND
CURRENT FORECASTS. ADDITIONAL WATCHES FOR THE U.S. AND BRITISH
VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY.
 
ALL LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE DEVELOPS A LARGE DEEP LAYER TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN U.S. BY 24 OCTOBER. SHOULD THIS AND THE CURRENT FORECAST FOR
JOSE VERIFY...A NORTHWARD TURN COULD OCCUR AFTER 72 HR. STAY TUNED.

THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH JOSE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE IN
ORGANIZATION WITH GOOD BANDING FEATURES AND EXCELLENT OUTFLOW.  T-
NUMBERS FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB ARE 4.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE. 
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE FOUND FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 73 KNOTS ON A SMALL
AREA TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  THEREFORE...JOSE IS BEING
UPGRADED TO HURRICANE STATUS AT THIS TIME AND BECAUSE AN UPPER-
LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO MOVE WITH THE HURRICANE...FURTHER
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/11.  A PERSISTENT STRONG 500 MB RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF JOSE SHOULD PROVIDE A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST STEERING
DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS AND THIS IS THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OF THE
MODELS.  ONLY THE GFDL TURNS THE HURRICANE MORE TO THE NORTHWEST
BEYOND 48 HOURS.   ON A LONGER RANGE...A LARGE UPPER-TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO PREVAIL OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  THIS TROUGH SHOULD
INDUCE A NORTHERLY TRACK BEYOND THREE DAYS.

THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED VERY MUCH DURING THE PAST
SIX HOURS. THE MAIN FEATURES ARE A CURVED CONVECTIVE BAND TO THE
EAST AND SOUTH OF THE CENTER AND GOOD OUTFLOW.  MINIMUM PRESSURE IS
992 MB AND THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS THAT THE RECON REPORTED AN
ELONGATED EYEWALL OPEN TO THE WEST.  INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 65
KNOTS AND I AM BEING GENEROUS.  BECAUSE AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE IS
FORECAST TO MOVE WITH THE HURRICANE...FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS
INDICATED.
 
JOSE APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN A JOG MORE TO NORTHWEST OR NORTH DURING
PAST HOUR OR SO...PERHAPS IT IS A REFORMATION OF THE CENTER.
HOWEVER...WITH A STRONG 500 MB HIGH TO THE NORTH...JOSE SHOULD TURN
BACK TO A TRACK BETWEEN WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST.  NONE OF THE
AVAILABLE MODELS INDICATE THE HURRICANE WILL TURN TO THE NORTH
BEFORE 36 OR 48 HOURS AND ALL MODELS UNANIMOUSLY BRING JOSE TO THE
NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN.  THEREFORE...A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TO
NORTHWEST TRACK IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. IT WOULD BE
HIGHLY UNLIKELY FOR JOSE TO TURN INMEDIATELY NORTHWARD...AND A

THE LATEST RECONNAISSANCE DATA RELAYED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE
HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT JOSE HAS BEEN MOVING ON
A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...315/11..OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS.
THIS IS TO THE RIGHT OF OUR PREVIOUS TRACK.  HOWEVER IT MAY BE
TEMPORARY...SINCE MID-TROPOSPHERIC OBSERVATIONS GATHERED BY THE NOAA
JET IMPLY SUBSTANTIAL RIDGING NORTH AND NORTHWEST OF THE HURRICANE.
THIS RIDGE COULD FORCE THE MOVEMENT BACK TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST ON
WEDNESDAY.  OUR CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED SOMEWHAT
TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT NOT AS MUCH TO THE RIGHT AS
IMPLIED BY THE CURRENT MOTION.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE U.K. MET
OFFICE MODEL PREDICTION...AND THE MOST RECENT NAVY VERSION OF THE
GFDL MODEL ALSO SHOWS A SIMILAR TRACK.
 
AIR FORCE RECON REPORTED FLIGHT-LEVEL...850 MB...WINDS OF 91 KNOTS
AND THIS IMPLIES MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS OF 70 KNOTS.  CENTRAL
PRESSURE...MEASURED BY DROPSONDE...WAS DOWN TO 986 MB.  THE RECON
ALSO CONFIRMS THAT THE CENTER LOCATION IS FAIRLY WELL EMBEDDED INTO
A CDO OF VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS.  JOSE REMAINS REASONABLY WELL-
ORGANIZED...AND ASSUMING THAT VERTICAL SHEAR DOES NOT INCREASE MUCH
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING SHOULD
OCCUR.

SATELLITE IMAGERY AND HURRICANE HUNTER DATA INDICATE STRENGTHENING
OVERNIGHT. THE LAST REPORTED MINIMUM PRESSURE WAS 980 MB...AND THE
MAXIMUM 850 MB WINDS WERE 99 KT. SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES VERY
COLD CLOUD TOPS TO -85C AND THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED A 30 NM WIDE EYE
OPEN TO THE SOUTH. THIS INTENSIFICATION OCCURRED DESPITE RESTRICTED
OUTFLOW OR POSSIBLE SHEAR ON THE WEST SIDE ON THE DEEP CONVECTION.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET TO 80 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 315/10. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A
MID/UPPER LEVEL VORTEX NEAR 25N66W THAT MAY BE WEAKENING THE RIDGE
NORTH OF JOSE AND ALLOWING A NORTHWESTWARD MOTION. HOWEVER...THE
VORTEX IS MOVING WESTWARD...WHICH LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF
JOSE MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD LATER TODAY. A GENERAL NORTHWEST TO
WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION IS EXPECTED THROUGH 48 HOURS...FOLLOWED BY A
MORE NORTHERLY MOTION AS A LARGE DEEP LAYER TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER
THE EASTERN U.S. AFFECTS JOSE. ALL LARGE SCALE AND HURRICANE
GUIDANCE AGREES ON THIS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED
SOMEWHAT TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...BUT IS ALONG THE
LEFT SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE. IT IS ALSO SLOWER THAN MUCH OF
THE GUIDANCE AT 72 HOURS...AS THE VARIOUS BAM MODELS...NOGAPS...
GFDN...AND UKMET FORECAST JOSE NORTH OF 28N BY THAT TIME.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS STILL SOMEWHAT OF A PARADOX. WHILE THE AVN
AND NOGAPS CONTINUE TO MOVE AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE NORTHWEST
WITH THE HURRICANE...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS SOUTHWESTERLY UPPER
LEVEL FLOW AHEAD OF JOSE. THESE WIND MAXIMA OFTEN DO NOT WEAKEN AS
FAST AS THE MODELS WOULD SUGGEST. THERE ARE ALSO THE FACTORS THAT
JOSE IS STEADILY INTENSIFYING AT THIS TIME...AND THAT THE SHIPS
MODEL WEAKENS THE SYSTEM AFTER 48 HOURS. THE INTENSITY FORECAST
SLOWS THE CURRENT INTENSIFICATION AFTER 12 HOURS AND PEAKS THE STORM
AT 100 KT IN 36 HOURS. SHOULD THE SHEAR DECREASE OR STAY AT CURRENT
VALUES...JOSE COULD GET MUCH STRONGER THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.
 
THE 64 KT AND 50 KT WIND RADII ARE ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY BASED ON THE
AIRCRAFT DATA. THE 34 KT WIND RADII ARE UNCHANGED...AND ARE IN
REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH A 0245Z ERS-2 SCATTEROMETER OVERPASS AND A

THE LATEST REPORT RECEIVED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE
HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT JOSE IS MOVING A TAD TO THE LEFT
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW
300/9 KT.  THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE SYNOPTIC REASONING REGARDING
THE TRACK FORECAST WITH A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION
THROUGH 24 HRS.  THEREAFTER...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE BENDS TO NORTH...
THEN NORTH-NORTHEAST AND ACCELERATES AS A MID-UPPER LEVEL TROUGH

SO JOSE MAY BE LOSING ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS BY THAT TIME. 
 
THERE WAS A RECENT DROPSONDE MEASUREMENT OF 994 MB SURFACE PRESSURE

WITHIN A CDO WITH VERY DEEP CONVECTION...TOPS TO -85C...WHICH HAS
BEEN EXPANDING DURING THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS.  IR SATELLITE IMAGERY

ADVISORY.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE LIKELY WHILE JOSE IS
INTERACTING WITH THE LEEWARD ISLANDS. THE FORECAST STILL ALLOWS FOR
SOME SLIGHT STRENGTHENING THROUGH 36 HRS.  THIS PRESUMES THAT THE
SHEAR DOES NOT BECOME PROHIBITIVELY STRONG.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS THE CENTER PASSING NORTH AND EAST

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT THU OCT 21 1999

STRONG WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WE HAVE BEEN
OBSERVING IN WV IMAGES SINCE YESTERDAY...HAVE PARTIALLY REMOVED THE
DEEP CONVECTION FROM THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER OF JOSE.  THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASE IN THE CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED BY
RECON.  JOSE IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM AT THIS TIME. 
MANY TROPICAL CYCLONES WEAKEN IN THIS REGION AS THEY INTERACT WITH
THE MID-OCEANIC UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WHICH NORMALLY IS LOCATED IN THIS
AREA. GLOBAL MODELS INSIST ON DEVELOPING AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OVER
JOSE.  IF THIS IS THE CASE...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE COULD RESTRENGTHEN
ONCE IT TURNS NORTHWARD AND THIS IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.

BECAUSE JOSE HAS BEEN SHEARED...THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER HAS BEEN MOVING
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD WITH THE LOW TO MIDDLE LEVEL FLOW.  HOWEVER...THE

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/08.  ALL OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS
SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH THEN NORTH-NORTHEAST IN RESPONSE TO A
MAJOR TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES MOVING FROM THE U.S. TO THE WESTERN
NORTH ATLANTIC.  THE 12Z UKMET AND GFDL MODELS ACCELERATES THE
FORWARD MOTION TO 40 KNOTS OR MORE AFTER 48 HOURS WHILE THE AVIATION
MODEL IS MUCH SLOWER.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE UKMET MODEL
AND IS A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE GFDL MODEL.
 
THE RECON SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 993 MB AT 1730Z AND THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS KEPT AT 55 KNOTS...ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO RECON IN
THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT SINCE THIS MORNING AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE
VERY DEEP CONVECTION IN THAT QUADRANT.  GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW THE
POSSIBILITY OF STRENGTHENING AGAIN AND THE WIND SPEED IS FORECAST TO
65 KNOTS IN 24 HOURS.  JOSE IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY
72 HOURS AS IT INTERACTS WITH THE APPROACHING TROUGH AND MOVES OVER
COLD WATER.
 
THE LATEST SURFACE WIND OBSERVATIONS FROM THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND
PUERTO RICO ARE ALL LESS THAT SUSTAINED TROPICAL STORM FORCE AND THE
WARNINGS ARE DISCONTINUED AT THIS TIME.

A TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE NEEDED FOR BERMUDA LATER

REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT
OVERNIGHT INDICATE THAT JOSE IS BEGINNING ITS TURN TO THE NORTH. 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 330/7.  THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND
THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS UNCHANGED AS JOSE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE
GENERALLY NORTHWARD TODAY AND ACCELERATE NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD ON
SATURDAY...IN RESPONSE TO A LARGE MID- TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVING
FROM THE EASTERN U.S. INTO THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF AND SLOWER THAN
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS...TO
ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE IN INITIAL MOTION.  THE FORECAST ACCELERATION
LATE IN THE PERIOD IS NOT AS LARGE AS INDICATED BY THE UKMET.
 
JOSE HAS BEEN MAINTAINING VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS AND THE RECON FIXES
SHOW THAT THE CENTER IS NOW JUST INSIDE THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THE
HIGHEST FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS WERE ABOUT 55 KT NORTH OF THE CENTER.  I
AM HOLDING THE INTENSITY AT 55 KT GIVEN THE IMPROVED APPEARANCE OF
THE STORM...EVEN THOUGH THE FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS WOULD SUGGEST A
SLIGHTLY LOWER SURFACE WIND ESTIMATE AT THIS TIME.  THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY FORECAST IS A BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE SHIPS MODEL
GUIDANCE...WHICH BRINGS JOSE TO 61 KT IN 36 HOURS.  JOSE IS EXPECTED
TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY 72 HOURS AS IT INTERACTS AND/OR MERGES
WITH THE APPROACHING TROUGH.

TIGHT CENTER.  UPPER-LEVEL WINDS NEVER RELAXED AS EXPECTED OR
FORECAST BY GLOBAL MODELS.  HOWEVER...IF JOSE BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARD

THE REASONING FOR THE FORECAST TRACK REMAINS UNCHANGED WITH A MAJOR
AMPLIFYING TROUGH MOVING FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE CANADIAN
MARITIME PROVINCES AND EXTENDING WELL SOUTHWARD IN 72 HOURS.  THIS
TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE JOSE NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD.  THE

THERE CONTINUES TO BE EXTENSIVE DEEP CONVECTION EAST OF THE CENTER
BUT THE AIRCRAFT MEASURED ONLY 60 KNOTS AT 850 MB TO THE NORTHEAST
OF THE CENTER AND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 994 MB.  THE FORECAST IS FOR

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT REPORTED A MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 994 MB...WHICH IS UP 3 MB FROM 24 HOURS AGO. 
THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER OF CIRCULATION IS NOW OUTSIDE AND SOUTHWEST OF
THE DEEP CONVECTION...WHEREAS LAST NIGHT IT WAS JUST INSIDE.  THE
AIRCRAFT REPORTED A PEAK FLIGHT LEVEL WIND OF 63 KT AT 850 MB ABOUT
90 MILES EAST-NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  HOWEVER A GPS DROPSONDE AT
THIS LOCATION MEASURED ONLY 38 KT AT THE SURFACE.  THE DROP ALSO
MEASURED A SURFACE PRESSURE OF 999 MB...INDICATING AN EXTREMELY WEAK
PRESSURE GRADIENT.  A SURFACE WIND ANALYSIS BY THE NOAA HURRICANE
RESEARCH DIVISION...BASED ON THESE OBSERVATIONS...SHOWS A PEAK
SURFACE WIND OF 49 KT.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS DROPPED TO 50 KT
AND MAY YET BE A BIT GENEROUS.  

THE INTENSITY FORECAST ALLOWS SLIGHT STRENGTHENING AS THE SHEAR JUST
AHEAD OF THE STORM MAY BE A LITTLE LESS.  HOWEVER...ON ITS MOST
RECENT PASS THROUGH THE CENTER THE AIRCRAFT FOUND A VERY LARGE AREA
OF LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS AND COULD NOT FIND A SINGLE WELL DEFINED
CENTER.  IF THE SHEAR DOES NOT LESSEN VERY SOON...JOSE MAY DISSIPATE
QUICKLY...RATHER THAN BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL AS INDICATED BY THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE FORECAST TRACK IS SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...BUT STILL
FASTER THAN THE UKMET GUIDANCE.  IF IT SURVIVES...THE SYSTEM SHOULD

SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES JOSE IS STARTING TO MERGE WITH A FRONTAL
ZONE TO THE NORTH. HOWEVER...THE STORM IS STILL PRODUCING DEEP
CONVECTION JUST NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER...AND THERE IS NOT YET A
COLD FRONT APPARENT SOUTH OF THE STORM. THUS...JOSE REMAINS A
TROPICAL CYCLONE FOR THIS PACKAGE. EVEN THOUGH SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE UNCHANGED FROM EARLIER...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
REDUCED TO 60 KT BASED ON WARMING OF THE CENTRAL CONVECTION AND THE
MORE BAROCLINIC APPEARANCE.

JOSE SHOULD CONTINUE ACCELERATING NORTH-NORTHEAST UNTIL
EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION IN ABOUT 12 HOURS.

JOSE IS STILL PRODUCING A LITTLE DEEP CONVECTION NORTHEAST OF THE
CENTER AS IT STARTS TO MERGE WITH A FRONTAL ZONE.  WITHIN A FEW
HOURS IT WILL BYPASS THE GULFSTREAM AND ENCOUNTER COOLER WATERS AS
IT CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST.  JOSE SHOULD

TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIFTEEN DISCUSSION NUMBER   2
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT THU OCT 28 1999
 
THE LAST RECONNAISSANCE FIX WAS AT 2223Z...WHEN THE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT REPORTED A PEAK WIND OF 37 KT AT 1500 FT AND A MINIMUM
PRESSURE OF 1002 MB.  AT THAT TIME THE CENTER WAS ON THE EASTERN
EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION AND WAS MOVING LITTLE.  ALTHOUGH THE
CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE...IT APPEARS HAVE RESUMED A MOSTLY
WESTWARD MOTION OF 280/5.  THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ESTIMATE...AS THERE IS A MID-LEVEL VORTEX TO
THE WEST OF THE PRESUMED CENTER THAT IS MOVING MORE RAPIDLY
WESTWARD.

THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 
THE DEPRESSION IS EMBEDDED IN LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW AT MID-LEVELS THAT
SHOULD TAKE THE SYSTEM TO THE NICARAGUAN COAST WITHIN 18-30 HOURS. 
BEYOND THAT...A TROUGH FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO
COULD IMPART A MORE NORTHWESTWARD TRACK...IF THE SYSTEM SURVIVES
SOME FAIRLY ROUGH TERRAIN IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE MAIN THREAT FROM
THE DEPRESSION IS HEAVY RAINFALL.  THE COLOMBIAN METEOROLOGICAL
SERVICE REPORTS THAT SAN ANDRES RECEIVED 3.58 INCHES OF RAIN IN THE
LAST SIX HOURS.

THE INITIAL INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS 30 KT...WITH SATELLITE
ESTIMATES 0F 30 AND 35 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB RESPECTIVELY.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL PREDICTS A SIGNIFICANT LESSENING OF THE
EASTERLY SHEAR NOW OVER THE DEPRESSION...AND BRINGS THE SYSTEM TO 52
KT PRIOR TO LANDFALL.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BIT LESS
AGGRESSIVE.

AS IS THE CASE WITH INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY AND WEAK SYSTEMS THE
CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE...CENTER FIXES FROM SAB AND MIAMI
SUGGEST THAT THE LLCC IS STILL PROGRESSING WESTWARD AT ABOUT 5 KNOTS
BUT THE DEEP CONVECTION IS A LITTLE FARTHER WEST OF THE CENTER
COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ANALYSES.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
285/05.  A COMPLICATING FACTOR IS THE SAN ANDRES WIND OBSERVATION AT
06 UTC OF 350/10...WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A LOW PRESSURE
CENTER TO THE EAST NORTHEAST OF THE ISLAND.  IN FACT...THE ARRIVAL
OF THE TROPICAL WAVE FROM THE EAST...NOW LOCATED ABOUT 78-79W...MAY
BE CAUSING AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE WIND FIELD AS THE TWO SYSTEMS MERGE
AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A NEW CENTER MAY FORM.  THIS WILL BE MORE
EVIDENT WITH THE VISIBLE IMAGERY LATER THIS MORNING.

TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN TWO CAMPS.  THE BAMS...STATISTICAL AND
STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL MOVE THE SYSTEM WESTWARD...WHILE THE
LBAR...UKMET...AND AVN TAKE A MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION. IN EITHER
CASE THE SYSTEM WILL BE OVER LAND FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME
AND MAY DISSIPATE.  HOWEVER...IF THE NORTHWESTWARD TRACK PREVAILS
AND THE SYSTEM CAN SURVIVE IT WILL MOVE INTO THE GULF OF HONDURAS
AND MAY REINTENSIFY...WHICH IS WHAT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DOES.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. THE MAIN
THREAT FROM THE DEPRESSION REMAINS THE POTENTIAL HEAVY RAINFALL.
   
THE INITIAL INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 30 KT...WITH SATELLITE
ESTIMATES 0F 30 AND 35 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB RESPECTIVELY.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL CONTINUES TO PREDICT A SIGNIFICANT
LESSENING OF THE EASTERLY SHEAR NOW OVER THE DEPRESSION...AND
FORECASTS THE SYSTEM TO A TROPICAL STORM PRIOR TO LANDFALL.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS REASONING AND MAKES THE SYSTEM A
MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM BEFORE LANDFALL.

MORNING VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIFTEEN
REVEAL A PARTIALLY EXPOSED CENTER ON THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION.  THIS IS CONFIRMED BY THE 12Z OBSERVATION FROM SAN
ANDRES ISLAND WHICH REPORTED SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS.  THUS...THE
CENTER HAS BEEN RE-LOCATED NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY POSITION.
AN EXTENDED SATELLITE LOOP SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER HAS BEEN MOVING
ON A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK SINCE LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON...AND
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 320/08 KNOTS.

THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 30 KNOTS.  THE DEPRESSION 
IS EXPERIENCING EASTERLY SHEAR DUE TO THE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE
POSITIONED OVER THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN SEA...PER WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
AND CLOUD DRIFT WINDS FROM THE CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN.

THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...ALONG WITH NOGAPS AND THE UK METEOROLOGICAL
OFFICE MODELS...SHOW THE HIGH OVER THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN DRIFTING
WESTWARD DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS.  ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM IS IN A
SHEARED...WEAKENED STATE AT THIS TIME THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF THE
TROPICAL WAVE LOCATED JUST EAST OF THE SYSTEM IS AN UNKNOWN.  IN
FACT...A BANDING FEATURE HAS DEVELOPED NORTH OF THE CENTER...NEAR
15N...AND EXTENDS SOUTHEAST FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES.  THE FORECAST
STILL SHOWS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE SYSTEM TO REACH TROPICAL STORM
STRENGTH BEFORE LANDFALL. 

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWEST MOTION
THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD AND IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE 
12Z TRACK GUIDANCE ENSEMBLE.  THE NHC TRACK IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT
WITH THE UK MET OFFICE TRACK...AND BRINGS THE SYSTEM INLAND OVER
NORTHEASTERN NICARAGUA BETWEEN 12 AND 24 HOURS.  THE SYSTEM EMERGES
INTO THE GULF OF HONDURAS BY 48 HOURS AND MAY RE-INTENSIFY...WHICH 
IS WHAT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS. HOWEVER...THERE IS CONSIDERABLE
UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST AS THE SYSTEM
COULD DISSIPATE OVER LAND.  

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER RECONNAISSANCE MISSION IS 
SCHEDULED FOR THIS AFTERNOON. AFTER COORDINATION WITH THE
GOVERNMENTS OF NICARAGUA AND COLOMBIA THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING
SOUTH OF BLUEFIELDS AND FOR THE SAN ANDRES ISLANDS WILL BE
DISCONTINUED.

THE PRIMARY THREAT WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO BE HEAVY
RAINFALL OVER PORTIONS OF NICARAGUA AND HONDURAS AND THE POTENTIAL
FOR FLASH FLOODING AND MUDSLIDES...ESPECIALLY IN MOUNTAINOUS

THROUGH TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIFTEEN FOUND A MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL
(1500 FT) WIND OF 43 KNOTS...A SURFACE WIND OF 35 KNOTS AND A
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 999 MB.  ON THIS BASIS...THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS RAISED TO 35 KT...AND TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIFTEEN IS

PARTIALLY EXPOSED THERE HAS BEEN A SMALL FLARE-UP OF CONVECTION
ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CENTER CORRESPONDING TO WHERE THE RECON
OBSERVED THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 305/10 KNOTS. ON THIS HEADING KATRINA

THE CIRCULATION OF KATRINA IS BEING DISRUPTED BY THE MOUNTAINOUS
TERRAIN OF EASTERN HONDURAS AND CONSEQUENTLY...HAS BECOME VERY
DIFFUSE.  VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE CIRCULATION
HAS BECOME ELONGATED NORTH-NORTHEAST/SOUTH-SOUTHWEST AND IN FACT...
THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE CENTERS. AS A COMPROMISE...I HAVE CHOSEN 
TO USE A CENTRAL POINT ALONG THE AXIS AS THE CENTER.  USING THIS
POSITION...THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/07 KNOTS.

AS WAS THE CASE EARLIER...MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE
REMAINS DIVERGENT. THE UKMET...WHICH HAS PERFORMED WELL WITH THIS

A 72 HOUR POINT OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. THIS TRACK IS
CONTINGENT ON THE SYSTEM SURVIVING ITS TREK ACROSS THE MOUNTAINOUS
TERRAIN OF HONDURAS. 

THERE IS NO LONGER ANY DEEP CONVECTION DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE CIRCULATION CENTER ALTHOUGH CONVECTION PERSISTS NEAR THE COAST
OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...BELIZE AND GUATEMALA.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS HELD AT 25 KNOTS. WHILE THE GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE 
THAT THE CONDITIONS COULD BECOME A BIT MORE FAVORABLE BY 24 HOURS
THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE LITTLE TIME TO RE-ORGANIZE. THEREAFTER...THE
UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT BECOMES INCREASING HOSTILE DUE TO STRONG
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO IN ASSOCIATION WITH
THE UPPER-LOW...CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL TEXAS...LIFTING OUT INTO

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT SAT OCT 30 1999
 
KATRINA HAS PULLED A HALLOWEEN TRICK. SATELLITE IMAGERY AND SURFACE
OBSERVATIONS DURING THE AFTERNOON INDICATED THE CIRCULATION WAS
ELONGATED FROM THE SOUTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO SOUTHEASTWARD TO
NORTHERN NICARAGUA. OBSERVATIONS FROM LA CEIBA AND ROATAN IN
HONDURAS HAVE SHOWN PERSISTENT SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS...INDICATING THE
CENTER HAS RE-FORMED OF THE GULF OF HONDURAS. THIS REQUIRES A RE-
LOCATION FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
WITH THE REFORMATION...THE INITIAL MOTION IS AT BEST A GUESS AND IS
SET TO 305/9. THE HURRICANE GUIDANCE REMAINS DIVERGENT...WITH THE
BAMS TAKING KATRINA TO THE PACIFIC IN 72 HOURS AND THE BAMD TAKING
IT TO THE FLORIDA KEYS. THE DEEP LAYER LOW OVER THE WESTERN GULF
STATES IS FORECAST TO MOVE EAST BY ALL LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE...AND
THIS SHOULD RECURVE KATRINA TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST REFLECT THIS...AND IS SHIFTED NORTH AND EAST OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST. LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THE 72 HOUR POINT
MAY NOT BE FAR ENOUGH EAST...BUT THERE IS ALREADY SO A LARGE CHANGE
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY THAT I AM RELUCTANT TO CHANGE IT FURTHER.
 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 30 KT AND 25 KT
RESPECTIVELY...WITH THE CENTRAL CONVECTION RATHER POORLY ORGANIZED.
THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 25 KT. SINCE SOME EASTERLY
SHEAR REMAINS...ONLY MODEST STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST BEFORE THE
CENTER MOVES OVER THE YUCATAN PENINSULA. AFTER THAT...THE FORECAST
IS COMPLEX. THE AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS DEVELOP A LOW OVER THE
NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO THAT APPEARS RELATED TO THE DEEP LAYER
TROUGH. SHOULD THIS VERIFY...IT WOULD LIKELY ABSORB KATRINA. THE
CYCLONE COULD ALSO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL AND BECOME THE FOCUS OF THE
DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF. THERE IS ALSO AN OUTSIDE CHANCE
THAT KATRINA COULD REGAIN TROPICAL STORM STATUS AS IT LEAVES THE
YUCATAN PENINSULA. THE LOW CONFIDENCE INTENSITY FORECAST IS FOR
KATRINA TO SURVIVE AS A 30 KT DEPRESSION THROUGH 72 HOURS.
 
A SPECIAL THANKS GOES TO THE METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE OF HONDURAS FOR
SENDING VALUABLE OBSERVATIONS VIA FAX AFTER NORMAL COMMUNICATIONS
HAD BROKEN DOWN.

THE CENTER REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE IN THE INFRARED SATELLITE
IMAGERY BUT SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM BELIZE AND MEXICO SUGGEST THAT
THE SYSTEM IS NOW OVER THE YUCATAN PENINSULA.  THE LATEST 0600 UTC
POSITION INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM IS MOVING MUCH FASTER AND THIS
MAY BE A RESULT OF THE RELOCATION PROCESS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW INCREASED TO 340/15.  WITH THIS
FASTER INITIAL MOTION THE MODEL GUIDANCE GENERALLY MOVES THE SYSTEM
FASTER TO THE NORTH AND EAST.  A NOTABLE EXCEPTION IS THE BAMS WHICH
TAKES THE SYSTEM SOUTHWESTWARD INTO THE EASTERN PACIFIC.  ALSO THE
UKMET WANTS TO DISSIPATE THE SYSTEM OVER THE YUCATAN AFTER 24 HOURS.
THE VARIOUS MODELS SUGGEST LANDFALLS ANYWHERE IN FLORIDA FROM THE
PANHANDLE TO THE FLORIDA KEYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BUT...OF COURSE...MUCH FASTER.  IF THE CURRENT
FORECAST COMES TO FRUITION THAN A TROPICAL STORM WATCH MAY BE
REQUIRED EITHER LATER TODAY OR EARLY TOMORROW FOR SOME PORTION OF
THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA.  
 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES STILL SUGGEST THAT KATRINA IS A WEAK
DEPRESSION WITH 25 KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM REMAINS POORLY ORGANIZED.
IN LIGHT OF THE FASTER FORWARD MOTION THE SYSTEM WILL EMERGE INTO
THE GULF OF MEXICO IN THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS AND MODEST
STRENGTHENING SHOULD BEGIN AS PER THE SHIPS FORECAST.  THE SYSTEM IS
FORECAST TO BE A MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM BRFORE IT MERGES WITH THE
LOW APPROACHING FROM THE WEST AND BECOMES EXTRATROPICAL.

SATELLITE IMAGERY AND LIMITED SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA SUGGESTS THAT THE ILL-DEFINED CENTER OF KATRINA IS OVER
THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE PENINSULA.  THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE
INITIAL MOTION IS 345/09 KNOTS.  

THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 25 KNOTS. GRADUAL STRENGTHENING 
IS INDICATED THROUGH 36 HOURS AS THE SYSTEM EMERGES INTO THE CENTRAL
GULF OF MEXICO ALTHOUGH THIS IS HIGHLY DEPENDANT ON THE TRACK. THE
INTENSITY FORECAST FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY HAS BEEN MAINTAINED
DUE TO THE UNCERTAINLY IN THE FORECAST TRACK. THE BEST CHANCE FOR
KATRINA TO REACH AND MAINTAIN TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY WILL BE ON
A MORE EASTERLY TRACK WHERE A MORE FAVORABLE SHEAR ENVIRONMENT IS
LIKELY TO EXISTS. KATRINA IS FORECAST BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY 72
HOURS AS IT MERGES WITH...OR IS ABSORBED BY...THE FRONTAL SYSTEM
APPROACHING FROM THE WEST.

THE FUTURE TRACK OF KATRINA IS HINGED ON THE DEEP-LAYER TROUGH 
OVER TEXAS AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM. BASED ON BOTH THE INITIAL
POSITION AND ON THE 12Z TRACK GUIDANCE...WHERE ONLY LBAR SHOWS A
MORE WESTERN TRACK AND MOVES THE SYSTEM INTO THE EASTERN FLORIDA
PANHANDLE AFTER 36 HOURS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS BEEN
SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  IT SHOULD BE
EMPHASIZED THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN THE LATTER
PORTION OF THIS TRACK. BASED ON THE PROJECT TRACK SCENARIO A
TROPICAL STORM WATCH MAY BE REQUIRED FOR PORTIONS OF THE WEST
FLORIDA COAST LATER TODAY OR TONIGHT.  ALL INTERESTS ELSEWHERE 
IN FLORIDA...AND IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO SHOULD
CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW THAT THE CENTER OF KATRINA HAS
BECOME A LITTLE BETTER DEFINED DURING THE DAY. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS
COUPLED WITH VISIBLE SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THE
CENTER OF KATRINA IS OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL PORTION OF THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA.  THIS REPRESENTS A SLIGHT WESTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  WEAK SYSTEMS LIKE THIS CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO
TRACK...ESPECIALLY OVER LAND.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW
325/08 KT.
 
ANALYSIS OF UPPER-AIR DATA OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN AND THE GULF
OF MEXICO SHOWS A MID-LEVEL HIGH NEAR EASTERN/CENTRAL CUBA WITH A
RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING ALONG 22N/23N.  KATRINA HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE
NORTHWEST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS FEATURE AND SHOULD BEGIN TO
TURN NORTH...THEN NORTH-NORTHEAST MONDAY AS IT PASSES NORTH OF THE 
AXIS. THE SYSTEM SHOULD BEGIN TO ACCELERATE TO THE NORTHEAST LATE
MONDAY/TUESDAY IN RESPONSE TO THE DEEP-LAYER TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER
EASTERN TEXAS SHIFTING EASTWARD INTO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO AND IS SLIGHTLY SLOWER
AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  WITH THE AVIATION MODEL
RUNNING LATE TODAY...THERE WAS LITTLE TRACK GUIDANCE AVAILABLE FROM
12Z MODELS RUNS. 

THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 25 KT.  THE FORECAST BRINGS KATRINA
TO MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH BY 24 HOURS AND MAINTAINS THAT
INTENSITY THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. AFTER 36 HOURS...THE
QUESTION IS WHETHER KATRINA MAINTAINS ITS IDENTITY OR IS ABSORBED BY
THE SYSTEM MENTIONED ABOVE. KATRINA IS FORECAST BECOME EXTRATROPICAL
BY 72 HOURS AS IT MERGES WITH...OR IS ABSORBED BY...THE FRONTAL
SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST.
 
BASED ON THE PROJECT TRACK SCENARIO A TROPICAL STORM WATCH MAY BE
REQUIRED FOR PORTIONS OF THE WEST FLORIDA COAST TONIGHT OR EARLY
FRIDAY.  ALL INTERESTS ELSEWHERE IN FLORIDA...AND IN THE CENTRAL

LAST VISIBLE IMAGERY OF THE DAY SHOWED THAT KATRINA WAS PRETTY MUCH
ON TRACK...WITH AN INTIAL MOTION OF 325/8.  THE CENTER IS STILL OVER
THE YUCATAN PENINSULA.  AIRCRAFT RECONNAISSANCE THIS EVENING SHOWS
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERE IN THE GULF AHEAD OF
KATRINA.  THIS SHOULD TURN THE CYCLONE TO THE NORTH THEN RAPIDLY TO
THE NORTHEAST...AHEAD OF THE CUTOFF LOW NOW IN EAST TEXAS.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

BASED ON OFFSHORE RECON DATA...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS LOWERED TO
20 KT.  KATRINA WILL BE MOVING OFFSHORE TOMORROW MORNING...AND THERE
MAY BE A BRIEF OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGHEN AT THAT TIME.  HOWEVER...
SHEAR IN ADVANCE OF THE CUTOFF LOW SHOULD PRECLUDE SIGNIFICANT
TROPICAL INTENSIFICATION.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS KATRINA
AS A DISTINCT ENTITY FOR 48 HOURS...BUT IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT
KATRINA WILL BECOME ABSORBED OR DISSIPATE ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
NOW IN THE WESTERN GULF BEFORE THEN.  ASSUMING THAT KATRINA...WHICH
HAS HELD ITSELF TOGETHER ADMIRABLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE DAYS...DOES
BEGIN TO STRENGTHEN IN THE SOUTHERN GULF...A TROPICAL STORM WATCH
MAY BE REQUIRED FOR PORTIONS OF THE WEST FLORIDA COAST EARLY MONDAY.

BE SLOWING TO BEGIN ITS TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.  HOWEVER...
NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE FROM ETA...AVN...AND UKMET SUGGEST THAT THE

THE CENTER OF KATRINA IS STILL INLAND OVER THE NORTHWEST YUCATAN
PENINSULA JUST SOUTH OF MERIDA...WHICH RECENTLY REPORTED A LIGHT
EAST-NORTHEAST WIND.  PROGRESSO...LOCATED JUST NORTH OF MERIDA...

THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 20 KT.  KATRINA IS FORECAST TO MOVE
OFFSHORE LATER TODAY HOWEVER...THE COLD FRONT FAST-APPROACHING FROM
THE WEST WILL LIKELY PROVIDE LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR SIGNIFICANT
DEVELOPMENT. 
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND CALLS FOR A NORTH-NORTHEAST...THEN NORTHEAST MOTION
THROUGH 24 HOURS.  DISSIPATION/ABSORPTION OF KATRINA BY THE FRONTAL
SYSTEM MENTIONED ABOVE IS EXPECTED BY 36 HOURS ALTHOUGH THIS MAY
OCCUR SOONER...MUCH SOONER. 
 
THE REMNANT MOISTURE WILL BE ABSORBED INTO THE FRONTAL SYSTEM AND

THE CIRCULATION IS BECOMING DIFFUSE AND THE CENTER IS HARD TO
IDENTIFY...EVEN ON HIGH-RESOLUTION VISIBLE IMAGES.  KATRINA IS BEING
ABSORBED INTO THE COLD FRONT THAT IS MOVING INTO THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA.  THIS IS CAUSING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO DISSIPATE.  THE
COMBINATION OF DRY STABLE AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT AND STRONG
UPPER-LEVEL WINDS SHOULD PRECLUDE REDEVELOPMENT.  

INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE.  THE
TRACK FORECAST IS ALSO SIMILAR...HOWEVER SINCE THE CENTER IS
BECOMING DIFFICULT TO FIND RIGHT NOW...NO POSITIONS ARE GIVEN BEYOND
24 HOURS.

MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH KATRINAS REMNANTS AND A MOIST TROPICAL FLOW
FROM THE CARIBBEAN INTO THE EASTERN GULF...COMBINED WITH THE FRONTAL
ZONE...STILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS OVER
PORTIONS OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

A US AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATED
THE BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA IN THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN THIS

CENTER.  DEPRESSION ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON THE BASIS OF THIS
INFORMATION.  SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW PLENTY OF DEEP

TAKING PLACE AT THIS TIME.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS FOR LITTLE
CHANGE TO THE 30 KNOT MAX ONE-MIN WINDS EXCEPT AT 72 HOURS WHEN SOME
OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES A POTENTIAL FOR STRENGTHENING.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 170/05.  ALMOST ALL OF THE MODELS
SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE EAST AS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVES ACROSS
NORTH AMERICA TO THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC IN 3 DAYS...GREATLY
AMPLIFYING THE LONG WAVE TROUGH.  THIS EXTENDS THE WESTERLIES SOUTH
TO THE DEPRESSION WHICH IS FORECAST TO RESPOND WITH AN EASTWARD
MOTION.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE AND IS

THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPRESSION HAS IMPROVED SLIGHTLY
THIS EVENING.  SINCE THE CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO MOVE GENERALLY
EASTWARD INTO AN AREA OF SLIGHTLY DECREASED VERTICAL SHEAR...AS
SUGGESTED BY WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN CIMSS...THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF STRENGTHENING.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST MAKES THE SYSTEM A TROPICAL STORM BY 24 HOURS. 
THIS COULD HAPPEN SOONER IF THE CURRENT ORGANIZING TREND IS
MAINTAINED.

SATELLITE FIXES HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE BUT MULTI-CHANNEL INFRARED
IMAGERY...WHICH ENHANCES LOW CLOUDS...SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER IS NOW
HEADED TOWARD THE SOUTHEAST.  A LARGE AND VIGOROUS MID-TROPOSPHERIC
VORTICITY MAXIMUM...CURRENTLY MOVING FROM CANADA TO THE GREAT
LAKES...IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST IN 1-2 DAYS AND
STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  THE
ASSOCIATED WESTERLY STEERING FLOW SHOULD CARRY THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
ON A GENERALLY EASTWARD TO EAST-NORTHEASTWARD TRACK DURING THE
PERIOD.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALONG A TRAJECTORY SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT SOMEWHAT FASTER IN THE FIRST PART OF THE

WHILE THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE HAS NOT
CHANGED APPRECIABLY OVERNIGHT...THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TREND HAS
BEEN THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE CENTER WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION
ALTHOUGH THE COLDEST TOPS...TO -80C...REMAIN NORTH.  HOWEVER...
TWO SHIP OBSERVATIONS..PCBZ AND ELUR3...NEAR THE CENTER SHOW WINDS
OF 12 AND 13 KT...RESPECTIVELY.  THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL
BE HELD AT 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAKES 
THE SYSTEM A TROPICAL STORM WITHIN 12 HOURS.
 
WHILE SATELLITE FIXES STILL SHOW SOME SCATTER...NOT UNUSUAL FOR
WEAK SYSTEMS USING IR IMAGERY...THE TWO SHIP OBSERVATIONS MENTIONED
ABOVE HELP PINPOINT THE CENTER. THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOW 095/08 KT.  THERE IS NO CHANGE WITH REGARDS TO THE
SYNOPTIC REASONING BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST AS A STRONG U.S. MID-
TROPOSPHERIC SHORTWAVE/LOW...ENTERING THE GREAT LAKES REGION AT
THIS TIME...IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST DURING THE
NEXT 24-36 HOURS AND RE-ENFORCE THE EXISTING TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC.  THE ASSOCIATED WESTERLY STEERING FLOW SHOULD MOVE THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE ON A GENERALLY EASTWARD TO EAST-NORTHEASTWARD
TRACK DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
UK METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE MODEL.
 
BASED ON THE CURRENT FORECAST TRACK...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY ALONG
WITH ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS INDICATE THAT
THE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO AN AREA OF SLIGHTLY DECREASED VERTICAL
WIND SHEAR THEREBY ALLOWING FOR SOME STRENGTHENING. AN AIR FORCE

TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIXTEEN DISCUSSION NUMBER   4
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 AM EST SUN NOV 14 1999
 
THE LOW LEVEL CENTER MAY BE OBSCURED BY DEEP CONVECTION AND IS
DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON EARLY VISIBLE IMAGERY.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 100/07 AND THE TRACK SCENARIO REMAINS THE SAME AS IN THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  A MOSTLY EAST TO EAST-NORTHEASTWARD MOTION IS
EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS AS THE UPPER TROUGH TO THE NORTH OF
THE DEPRESSION DEEPENS AND EXTENDS THE WESTERLIES FURTHER SOUTHWARD.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE AT TROPICAL STORM FORCE BUT THERE
HAVE BEEN NO SHIP OR ISLAND REPORTS TO CONFIRM THIS.  AN AIRCRAFT IS
SCHEDULED TO INVESTIGATE THIS AFTERNOON AND I WILL DELAY UPGRADING
THE DEPRESSION UNTIL THE AIRCRAFT REPORTS TROPICAL STORM FORCE
WINDS.  MEANWHILE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS FOR THE DEPRESSION TO
BECOME A TROPICAL STORM IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 090/05.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE IS
CLOSELY CLUSTERED ABOUT A TRACK THAT BRINGS THE CENTER TO NEAR OR
JUST PAST PUERTO RICO IN 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
SIMILAR TO AND AN UPDATE OF THE SPECIAL ADVISORY ISSUED AT 1915Z AND
CLOSELY FOLLOWS THE UKMET...GFDL...AND NOGAPS MODELS.
 
THE MAXIMUM WIND SPEED REPORTED SO FAR FROM THE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT IS 66 KNOTS AT 1000-1500 FEET FLIGHT LEVEL JUST SOUTHEAST
OF THE CENTER.  BUT THE PRESSURE HAS FALLEN TO 988 MB SO THE SURFACE
WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 60 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY AND IS
FORECAST TO REACH HURRICANE FORCE IN 12 HOURS OR LESS...BASED ON THE
APPEARANCE OF AN EYE TYPE FEATURE.  THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL
STRENGTHENING THEREAFTER.

HURRICANE LENNY DISCUSSION NUMBER   7
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 PM EST SUN NOV 14 1999

SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN THE CLOUD PATTERN OVER THE
PAST FEW HOURS...SO THE INTENSITY APPEARS TO HAVE LEVELLED OFF FOR
THE TIME BEING.  A BURST OF CONVECTION OVER THE CENTER HAS OBSCURED
THE EYE ON THE INFRARED IMAGERY.  HOWEVER AN EYE WITH A DIAMETER OF
15-20 N MI WAS EVIDENT ON A RECENT SSM/I PASS OVER THE HURRICANE.
CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 70 KNOTS...IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH
DVORAK T-NUMBERS.  ANOTHER HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO
PROVIDE A POSITION AND INTENSITY ESTIMATE AROUND 0600 UTC.

OBVIOUSLY...THE RAPID INTENSIFICATION OF THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE WAS
NOT ANTICIPATED.  THIS AGAIN UNDERSCORES OUR LIMITED ABILITY TO
PREDICT INTENSITY CHANGE.  LENNY IS DEVELOPING A FAIR UPPER-LEVEL
OUTFLOW ANTICYCLONE AND...PRESUMING THAT VERTICAL SHEAR DOES NOT
INCREASE TOO MUCH DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS... ADDITIONAL
STRENGTHENING IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.  THIS IS INDICATED IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE CENTER HAS SLIPPED A LITTLE TO THE SOUTH BUT MOTION IS ESTIMATED
TO BE GENERALLY EASTWARD AT A SLIGHTLY FASTER FORWARD SPEED...7
KNOTS.  LENNY IS EXPECTED TO BE STEERED BY THE FLOW ON THE SOUTH
SIDE OF A DEEP-LAYER TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  CURRENT
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A REINFORCING VORTICITY MAX MOVING OFF THE
U.S. EAST COAST...AND THE 18Z NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS ADDITIONAL
VORTICITY ENTERING THE TROUGH DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS
SHOULD PRODUCE SOME AMPLIFICATION OF THE TROUGH AND AN INCREASED
WESTERLY STEERING FLOW FOR LENNY.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A
GRADUAL INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED AND A TURN TOWARD THE EAST-
NORTHEAST...IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE U.K. MET. OFFICE AND GFDL
MODELS.  THIS IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK
FORECAST.

A RECON AIRCRAFT JUST REPORTED 66 KNOTS AT 1000 FT ALTITUDE TO THE
SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER ALONG WITH A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 992 MB. 
THE DEPRESSION IS UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM ON THIS BASIS.  IT IS
FORECAST TO REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 12 HOURS AS THERE APPEARS TO
BE AN EYE FORMING ON SATELLITE IMAGERY AND THIS IS ALSO REPORTED
FROM THE AIRCRAFT.

THE TRACK FORECAST IS BASED ON THE SAME REASONING AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...MOVING TOWARD THE EAST TO EAST-NORTHEAST UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF AN AMPLIFYING TROUGH TO THE NORTH OF THE STORM.  THE
TRACK FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
BASED ON THE INITIAL POSITION BEING MOVED FURTHER NORTH.

THE PROXIMITY TO JAMAICA REQUIRES TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS AND A

HURRICANE LENNY DISCUSSION NUMBER   8
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST MON NOV 15 1999
 
LENNY IS STRENGTHENING RATHER QUICKLY THIS MORNING. REPORTS FROM AN
AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER INDICATE THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS
DROPPED TO 971 MB...WITH MAXIMUM 850 MB WINDS OF 100 KT. AN EYE
APPEARS INTERMITTENTLY ON INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE ALL 77 KT. BASED
ON THE AIRCRAFT DATA...THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE RAISED TO 85 KT FOR
THIS PACKAGE. DESPITE THE INTENSIFICATION...THE WIND RADII REMAIN
RATHER SMALL.
 
LENNY MOVED EAST-SOUTHEAST DURING THE EVENING. HOWEVER...THE LATEST
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A MORE EASTWARD MOTION AND THE INITIAL
MOTION FOR THIS ADVISORY IS 095/8. A LARGE LONGWAVE TROUGH DOMINATES
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...AND THIS SHOULD KEEP LENNY ON A GENERALLY
EASTWARD TRACK FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS. LARGE SCALE MODELS
SUGGESTS THAT A MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL DEVELOP EAST OF THE
LESSER ANTILLES AFTER 36 HOURS...WHICH SHOULD TURN LENNY MORE TO THE
NORTHEAST. THE AMOUNT OF TURN...HOWEVER...IS UNCERTAIN. THE MEAN
POSITION OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH IN THE MODELS IS ABOUT THE SAME
LONGITUDE AS THE HURRICANE...WHICH WOULD SUPPORT A MORE EASTWARD
MOTION. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE NOGAPS. ON THE OTHER HAND...MOST
OTHER GUIDANCE TURNS THE STORM MORE SHARPLY TO THE NORTHEAST. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE POSITIONS AND IS
ALONG THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE.
 
AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OR ANTICYCLONE REMAINS OVER LENNY...SO FURTHER
INTENSIFICATION APPEARS LIKELY. THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS HOW LONG
WILL THE CURRENT RAPID STRENGTHENING CONTINUE? THE INTENSITY
FORECAST CALLS FOR FURTHER STRENGTHENING FOR 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A
LEVELING OUT. ALTHOUGH MAJOR NOVEMBER HURRICANES ARE NOT UNHEARD
OF...THEY ARE UNCOMMON ENOUGH THAT I WILL NOT FORECAST LENNY TO
BECOME ONE JUST YET.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 115/09.  THE REASONING BEHIND THE
TRACK FORECAST REMAINS UNCHANGED.  AN AMPLIFYING LONG WAVE TROUGH
OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THE HURRICANE
MOSTLY EASTWARD AND THEN NORTHEASTWARD FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THE
GUIDANCE MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT ON THIS AND THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO AND AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  THE TRACK IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY THROUGH ABOUT 48 HOURS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE
CONTINUED SOUTHWARD COMPONENT OF THE INITIAL MOTION.
 
THE CONVECTIVE PATTERN ON SATELLITE IMAGERY IS NOT TOO IMPRESSIVE
FOR A STRENGTHENING 971-MB HURRICANE AND THE EYE FEATURE IS NOT WELL
DEFINED.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY AND FORECAST ARE UNCHANGED FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE IS SCHEDULED INTO THE

HURRICANE LENNY DISCUSSION NUMBER  10
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 PM EST MON NOV 15 1999
 
BASED ON A RECENT AIRCRAFT FIX...THE INITIAL MOTION IS 095/13.  THIS
IS A LITLE FASTER THAN BEFORE AND THE SATELLITE FIXES GIVE A MOTION
CLOSER TO 10 KNOTS.  THE REASONING FOR THE FORECAST TRACK IS
UNCHANGED.  A DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC IS
EXPECTED TO MOVE THE HURRICANE MOSTLY EASTWARD AND THEN
NORTHEASTWARD FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  SOME OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES
THAT THE FORWARD MOTION MAY SLOW A LITTLE AFTER 48 HOURS AS THE
SHORT WAVE MOVES AWAY WITHOUT TOTALLY PICKING UP THE HURRICANE.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS THEREFORE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AFTER 48 HOURS...OTHERWISE THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE
TRACK FORECAST.
 
THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS RISEN FROM 971 TO 981 IN 12 HOURS AND THE
MAXIMUM WIND MEASURED BY RECON IS 73 KNOTS FROM A GPS DROP IN THE
SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED TO 75 KNOTS ON THIS
BASIS.  THE SHIPS MODEL FORECASTS 15 KNOTS OF STRENGTHENING IN
36 HOURS.  BUT BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT WEAKENING TREND...THE WIND
SPEED WILL BE HELD CONSTANT AT 75 KNOTS THROUGH 72 HOURS.
 
BASED ON THE FORECAST TRACK...IT IS NOW TIME TO ISSUE A HURRICANE
WATCH FOR PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 PM EST MON NOV 15 1999

THERE IS NO EYE EVIDENT EITHER ON MICROWAVE OR INFRARED IMAGERY AND
THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN...EVEN THOUGH IT CONTAINS CONSIDERABLE AND
VERY DEEP CONVECTION...IS NOT THAT WELL ORGANIZED.  EARLIER RECON
DATA IMPLIED CONSIDERABLE WEAKENING AND CURRENT DVORAK DATA T-
NUMBERS ARE ALSO DOWN FROM WHERE THEY WERE EARLIER TODAY.  CURRENT
INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 70 KNOTS.  WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY LENNY
WEAKENED TODAY...EXCEPT THAT ITS VERY SMALL INNER CORE REGION MAY BE
VERY SENSITIVE TO SUBTLE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES.  DROPSONDE DATA FROM
THE NOAA G-IV JET MISSION THIS EVENING SHOW A FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW PATTERN BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE CONFINED TO
A SHALLOWER LAYER...AROUND 200 MB...THAN WE NORMALLY SEE.  BOTH THE
SHIPS AND THE TRIPLY-NESTED GFDL MODEL INDICATE THAT SOME RE-
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR...AND THIS IS ALLOWED FOR IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.

CENTER FIXES ARE RATHER UNCERTAIN...BUT USING A BLEND OF INFRARED
AND MICROWAVE-BASED POSITION ESTIMATES...INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
080/12.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ONE.  LENNY IS LIKELY TO BE STEERED BY THE FLOW AROUND THE
SOUTHERN PORTION OF A DEEP-LAYER TROUGH.  WIND DATA FROM THE G-IV
SUPPORT THIS SCENARIO AS WELL.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS SOME
AMPLIFICATION OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE TO THE EAST OF THE
LEEWARD ISLAND IN 2-3 DAYS.  THIS SHOULD CAUSE A MORE NORTHEASTWARD
TRACK IN THE LATTER PART OF THE PERIOD.

SINCE THE FORECAST TRACK AND WIND RADII BRING TROPICAL STORM FORCE
WINDS TO PUERTO RICO IN 24 HOURS...IT IS PRUDENT TO ISSUE HURRICANE
WARNINGS FOR THAT AREA AT THIS TIME.  THE SLIGHTLY LARGER EXTENT OF
34-KNOT WINDS TO THE NORTH SHOWN ON THIS ADVISORY ALSO NECESSITATES
THE ISSUANCE OF A TROPICAL STORM WARNING FOR THE SOUTH COAST OF THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

HERE WE GO AGAIN! REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT INDICATE LENNY IS STRENGTHENING WITH A MINIMUM CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 971 MB AND MAXIMUM 850 MB WINDS OF 109 KT. THE PLANE
ALSO REPORTED A 45 NM WIDE EYE. ALTHOUGH NO EYE IS VISIBLE IN
SATELLITE IMAGERY...THE CLOUD TOPS NEAR THE CENTER ARE -80C TO -85C
AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE AS HIGH AS 102 KT. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS SET TO 85 KT...AND THIS MAY BE A BIT CONSERVATIVE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 085/13...ALTHOUGH THE TWO AIRCRAFT FIXES HINT
AT A POSSIBLE FASTER MOTION OF 15-16 KT. THE ENVIRONMENT IS LITTLE
CHANGED FROM 24 HOURS AGO...WITH A LARGE DEEP LAYER TROUGH NORTH OF
THE HURRICANE. LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A RIDGE SHOULD BUILD
EAST OF THE LESSER ANTILLES...WHICH SHOULD TURN LENNY TO A
NORTHEASTWARD TRACK IN THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS. ALL MODEL FORECASTS ARE
CLUSTERED AROUND A TRACK THROUGH PUERTO RICO AND/OR THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS...WITH THE ONLY DIFFERENCES BEING IN HOW FAST LENNY MOVES.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. IT IS
NOTABLE THAT IF LENNY DOES NOT TURN SOON...THE FORECAST MAY NEED TO
BE ADJUSTED EASTWARD...INCREASING THE THREAT TO THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.
AFTER PASSAGE THROUGH THE ISLANDS...THE NOGAPS AND ECMWF MODELS
BUILD A SHORTWAVE RIDGE NORTH OF LENNY WHICH COULD SLOW THE SYSTEM
DOWN. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE FIRST PART OF THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS TRICKY. WITH THE COLD
TOPS AND GENERALLY FAVORABLE OUTFLOW...IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LENNY
COULD BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE LATER TODAY. ON THE OTHER HAND...THE
RAPID INTENSIFICATION SEEN LAST NIGHT STOPPED RATHER ABRUPTLY DURING
THE DAY. THE INTENSITY FORECAST COMPROMISES BETWEEN THESE TWO
EXTREMES AND TAKES LENNY ACROSS PUERTO RICO AT 95 KT. THINGS ARE
SIMPLER AFTER PASSAGE THROUGH THE ISLANDS...AS A COMBINATION OF
COOLER WATER AND INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR SHOULD WEAKEN THE
HURRICANE.

FIXES FROM RECONNAISSANCE PLANES AND SATELLITE INDICATE THAT LENNY
IS MOVING ABOUT 070/15 KNOTS.  GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A RIDGE TO THE EAST OF THE HURRICANE.  THIS WOULD
RESULT ON A CONTINUED EAST-NORTHEAST TRACK AND THEN NORTHEAST AROUND
THE DEVELOPING RIDGE DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  THIS IS THE
SOLUTION INDICATED BY MOST OF THE MODELS...WITH SOME SUGGESTING A
DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED.  IN FACT...THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL
FORECASTS THE HURRICANE TO MOVE ON A SLOW NORTHEAST TO NORTH TRACK
OVER PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.   IF THIS MATERIALIZES...IT
COULD RESULT IN EVEN WORSE CONDITIONS FOR THE AREA UNDER WARNING. 
ALL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE COMPLETED SOON AGAINST THIS DANGEROUS
HURRICANE.  

SINCE THE HURRICANE IS COMING FROM THE SOUTHWEST...MARINE INTERESTS
SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THE STRONGEST WINDS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE SOUTH
AND WEST FACING UNPROTECTED HARBORS.  KLAUS IN NOVEMBER 1984
PRODUCED CONSIDERABLE MARINE DAMAGE TO THIS AREA AND IT WAS ONLY A
TROPICAL STORM.
 
SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THIS IS A WELL ORGANIZED HURRICANE
WITH EXCELLENT BANDING FEATURES...AN INTERMITTENT EYE AND GOOD
OUTFLOW.  DROPSONDES MEASURED 965 MB PRESSURE IN THE EYE...MEAN
BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS OF 107 KNOTS...AND MEASURED 96 KNOTS AT THE
SURFACE.  THE EXTRAPOLATED PRESSURE FROM 700 MB WAS 960 MB WITH PEAK
WINDS OF 112 KNOTS. INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEN ADJUSTED TO 100 KNOTS.
THIS MAKES LENNY A DANGEROUS CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR
SIMPSON SCALE...THE FIFTH MAJOR HURRICANE OF THE SEASON. 
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOUR OR SO.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 PM EST TUE NOV 16 1999
 
A FEW HOURS AGO...A GPS DROPSONDE MEASURED A WIND SPEED OF 126 KNOTS
AT 907 MB IN THE SOUTHEAST EYEWALL.  THE MEAN BOUNDARY LAYER WIND
WAS 101 KNOTS.  A CENTER FIX BY THE NEW WC-130 MODEL J HURRICANE
HUNTER AIRCRAFT SHOWED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 958 MB AT 0029Z...
INDICATING A LITTLE MORE DEEPENING.  THE PRESENTATION ON THE SAN
JUAN WSR-88D RADAR IS BECOMING BETTER DEFINED WITH A 25 N MI
DIAMETER EYE SURROUNDED BY A CLOSED WALL.  THE RADAR ALSO MEASURED
CLOUD TOPS TO 60000 FEET IN AN OUTER RAINBAND ABOUT 90 N MI SOUTH OF
THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF PUERTO RICO.  THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY
OF ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING OF LENNY WITHIN THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS
SINCE VERTICAL SHEAR REMAINS FAIRLY WEAK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
MERELY HOLDS THE WINDS STEADY BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES IN
INTENSITY PREDICTION.  LATER IN THE PERIOD...WEAKENING IS EXPECTED
DUE TO AN INCREASINGLY UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.
 
THE EXPECTED NORTHEASTWARD TURN HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET.  INITIAL
MOTION IS 070/14.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY
EAST ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONTINUED EAST-NORTHEASTWARD MOTION OVER THE
PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  MOST OF THE MODELS STILL INDICATE A MORE
NORTHEASTWARD MOTION WITHIN 12 TO 24 HOURS...AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE ENSEMBLE.  SINCE
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DEEP-LAYER TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO DE-AMPLIFY
DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...SOME SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED
IS FORECAST.
 
DANGEROUS WINDS EXTEND MUCH FARTHER TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE
CENTER THAN TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE HURRICANE WARNING IS EXTENDED
EASTWARD AND SOUTHWARD TO INCLUDE ANTIGUA...BARBUDA AND MONTSERRAT.
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.

HURRICANE LENNY DISCUSSION NUMBER  16
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST WED NOV 17 1999
 
REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATE
LENNY CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN. THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DROPPED TO
950 MB WITH MAXIMUM 700 MB WINDS OF 120 KT IN THE SOUTHEAST
QUADRANT. A SOUTHEAST EYEWALL DROPSONDE HAD 132 KT WINDS AT 924 MB
AND 110 KT JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE. AN EYE IS BECOMING APPARENT IN
INFRARED IMAGERY...AND THE SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 127
KT...115 KT...AND 102 KT FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA RESPECTIVELY.
BASED ON THIS...THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 110 KT ON THIS
PACKAGE.

LENNY MAY BE STARTING ITS NORTHEASTWARD TURN. THE 12 HOUR AND
ADVISORY MOTION IS 065/12...AND A SHORTER TERM MOTION IS MORE
NORTHEASTERLY. WATER VAPOR AND INFRARED IMAGERY INDICATES A RIDGE IS
STARTING TO DEVELOP EAST OF LENNY...WHICH SHOULD EVENTUALLY NUDGE
LENNY ONTO A NORTHEAST TRACK. THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS THE FORWARD
MOTION. THE ECMWF AND NOGAPS MODELS SLOW LENNY BEFORE THE STORM
REACHES THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS. THE AVN...UKMET...AND HURRICANE
GUIDANCE ARE MORE PROGRESSIVE...SLOWING THE STORM AFTER IT MOVES
INTO THE OPEN ATLANTIC. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE LATTER
SOLUTION...AS THERE IS NO OBVIOUS REASON LENNY SHOULD STALL BEFORE
REACHING THE ISLANDS.
 
LENNY CONTINUES TO HAVE GOOD OUTFLOW IN ALL QUADRANTS EXCEPT THE
WEST...ALONG WITH VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS. SOME FURTHER STRENGTHENING
IS POSSIBLE TODAY. AFTER THE HURRICANE PASSES THROUGH THE
ISLANDS...A COMBINATION OF COOLER WATER AND INCREASING VERTICAL
SHEAR SHOULD CAUSE CONSIDERABLE WEAKENING.
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.

10 AM EST WED NOV 17 1999
 
LENNY IS NOW A DANGEROUS CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR
/SIMPSON HURRICANE SCALE...THE FIFTH OF THE SEASON.  THIS IS
BASED ON A DROPSONDE IN THE EYEWALL WHICH MEASURED MEAN BOUNDARY
LAYER WINDS OF 118 KNOTS...REPORTS FROM A PLANE OF A MAXIMUM WIND OF
134 KNOTS AT 700 MB AND A MINIMUM MEASURED PRESSURE OF 948 MB AND A
LATER EXTRAPOLATED 942 MB.  SUBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS ARE BETWEEN 6.0 AND
6.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE WITH A PEAK 7.0 RAW OBJECTIVE T-NUMBER. 
SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36
HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS LENNY MOVES
INTO A LESS FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT.
 
LENNY HAS SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE AND THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL
MOTION IS 055/10.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UNLIKELY SOLUTION OF
NOGAPS...WHICH TURNS LENNY NORTHWARD TODAY...THE REMAINDER OF THE
MODELS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT...TAKING
LENNY SLOWLY TOWARD THE NORTHEAST OVER THE NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN
ISLANDS.  THIS MOTION WAS EXPECTED BECAUSE GLOBAL MODELS HAVE BEEN
DEVELOPING A RIDGE TO THE EAST OF THE LENNY.  IN SUMMARY...THERE HAS
BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE STEERING PATTERN CONTROLLING THE PATH OF THE
HURRICANE. 
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.  
 
IF THE NORTHEASTWARD TREND CONTINUES DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS AND
THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK...THE WARNINGS FOR
MAINLAND PUERTO RICO..BUT NOT FOR CULEBRA AND VIEQUES WILL LIKELY BE
DOWNGRADED.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 PM EST WED NOV 17 1999
 
LENNY CONTINUES TO MOVE ON A GENERAL NORTHEASTWARD TRACK ABOUT 8
KNOTS.  BECAUSE THE STEERING CURRENTS CONTROLLING THE PATH OF THE
HURRICANE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE...THIS GENERAL NORTHEASTWARD
MOTION IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH MOST THE TRACK AND GLOBAL MODELS AND PREVIOUS FORECASTS.
 
THE SIGNIFICANT EVENT OF THE DAY IS THE UNEXPECTED INTENSIFICATION
OF LENNY...INDICATING THAT THERE IS LITTLE SKILL IN FORECASTING
RAPID INTENSITY CHANGES.  THE CENTRAL PRESSURE EXTRAPOLATED FROM 700
MB HAS FALLEN TO 927 MB WHILE A DROP MEASURED 934 MB.  THE 
FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS HAVE INCREASED TO 149 KNOTS.  THE MEAN BOUNDARY
LAYER WINDS FROM DROPSONDES ARE 155 KNOTS AND PEAK WINDS REACHED 180
KNOTS AT THE 891-MB LEVEL A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.  BASED ON THAT
INFORMATION...INITIAL INTENSITY WAS ADJUSTED TO 130 KNOTS.
LENNY IS VERY CLOSE TO BEING A CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE ON THE
SAFFIR/SIMPSON SCALE.  HURRICANES NORMALLY DO NOT STAY WITH SUCH
STRENGTH FOR A LONG TIME...THEREFORE SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY
ARE ANTICIPATED DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A
GRADUAL WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS LENNY MOVES INTO A LESS FAVORABLE
UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT.
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.
 
BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUED EASTWARD MOTION...THE HURRICANE WARNING FOR
MAINLAND PUERTO RICO HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM WARNING
BUT NOT FOR CULEBRA AND VIEQUES.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 PM EST WED NOV 17 1999

...CORRECTION PARAGRAPH 1...
 
THE LAST SEVERAL FIXES FROM U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT EARLIER THIS EVENING INDICATED THAT LENNY HAS BEEN DRIFTING
EAST-NORTHEASTWARD. IN FACT...THE HURRICANE HAS MOVED LITTLE DURING
THE LAST TWO HOURS.  THIS IS CONFIRMED BY NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
DOPPLER RADAR DATA OUT OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO. THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS QUASI-STATIONARY.
 
THE LATEST DATA RELAYED FROM THE RECON AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE IS NOW 939 MB...UP 5 MB OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL HOURS.  THE HIGHEST FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS FOUND ON THE MOST
RECENT PASSES IS 128 KT.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 125 KT
FOR THIS ADVISORY.
 
ANALYSIS OF UPPER AIR DATA FROM THE NORTHEAST CARIBBEAN SHOWS THAT
LENNY IS IN A COL POINT BETWEEN THE TWO MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGHS. A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH THE EASTERN/SOUTHEASTERN
U.S. IS EXPECTED TO MOVE EASTWARD INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING
THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS.  THIS SHOULD HELP BUILD THE RIDGE TO THE EAST
OF THE HURRICANE AND ALLOW THE GENERAL NORTHEAST MOTION TO RESUME.
MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK AGREES ON A GENERAL NORTHEAST MOTION. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED
ON THE TRACK UNCERTAINTY. 

THE INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS GRADUAL WEAKENING THROUGH THE NEXT 
24 HOURS AS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ENCOUNTERS AN INCREASING HOSTILE
UPPER-AIR ENVIRONMENT.  HOWEVER...IF LENNY STAYS QUASI-STATIONARY
LONG ENOUGH IT MAY WEAKEN MORE DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS THAN
FORECAST.  

BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.
 
AS A RESULT OF THE QUASI-STATIONARY MOTION...TROPICAL STORM WARNING
HAVE BEEN RETAINED FOR EASTERN PORTIONS OF PUERTO RICO WHILE
HURRICANE WARNING REMAIN POSTED FOR CULEBRA AND VIEQUES...AND THE
U.S. AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.
 
ANALYSES FROM THE HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION WERE USED TO ADJUST

DATA FROM THE SAN JUAN WSR-88D AND AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE
HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATE THAT LENNY IS DRIFTING EAST..080/03. WHILE
THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS RISEN TO 947 MB...700 MB WINDS HAVE BEEN AS
HIGH AS 145 KT. AN EYEWALL DROPSONDE INDICATED 132 KT NEAR THE
SURFACE. BASED ON THIS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 125 KT.
 
LENNY IS CURRENT LOCATED BETWEEN A MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE TO THE
SOUTHEAST AND A BUILDING LOW/MID LEVEL TO THE NORTH...WHICH MAY BE
CAUSING THE CURRENT SLOWER MOTION. MODEL GUIDANCE HAS BECOME QUITE
DIVERSE...FROM THE UKMET SHOWING A SLOW NORTHWARD DRIFT TO THE BAMD
MOVING THE STORM EASTWARD. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. MAY COME CLOSE ENOUGH TO LENNY TO
NUDGE IT NORTHEASTWARD...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BASED ON THIS
AND SOME CONTINUITY FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. AN ALTERNATIVE
SCENARIO WOULD BE VERY LITTLE MOTION OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

LENNY IS STILL OVER WARM WATER AND IS SOUTH OF THE STRONG UPPER
LEVEL WESTERLIES. THEREFORE...ANY FURTHER WEAKENING SHOULD BE SLOW.
THE AVN AND UKMET ARE FORECASTING STRONG WESTERLIES TO CONTINUE
NORTH OF 20N. IF THE FORECAST NORTHEASTWARD MOTION OCCURS...THE
SHEAR SHOULD INCREASE AFTER 36 HOURS ALONG WITH COOLING SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES...WHICH SHOULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT WEAKENING.

FORECAST WIND RADII HAVE BEEN EXPANDED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE
HURRICANE IN ANTICIPATION OF THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE INCREASING THE
PRESSURE GRADIENT THERE.
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.
 
AS A RESULT OF THE SLOW MOTION...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS REMAIN IN
EFFECT FOR THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF PUERTO RICO WHILE HURRICANE
WARNING REMAIN POSTED FOR CULEBRA AND VIEQUES...AND THE U.S. AND
BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

SAN JUAN WSR-88D INDICATES THAT LENNY HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY

TO REMAIN WEAK DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO...NO SIGNIFICANT
MOTION IS INDICATED THROUGH THAT PERIOD.  WV IMAGES SHOW AN EASTWARD
MOVING SHORT WAVE CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.
THIS FEATURE MAY PRODUCE AN INCREASE IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW NEAR
THE HURRICANE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...FORCING LENNY TO MOVE
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD AS INDICATED IN
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THIS IS THE GENERAL SOLUTION PROVIDED BY
MOST OF THE TRACK AND GLOBAL MODELS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE
RELIABLE AND GOOD PERFORMER UK MODEL WHICH KEEPS THE HURRICANE ON A
SLOW NORTHWARD TRACK.  ON THE UK MODEL...THE SHORTWAVE BYPASSES THE
HURRICANE...KEEPING LENNY SOUTH OF 25 DEGREES NORTH FOR AT LEAST 3
OR 4 DAYS.
 
THE EYE IS NOT LONGER VISIBLE ON SATELLITE IMAGES BUT IT IS WELL
DEFINED ON RADAR. BECAUSE BOTH THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS BEEN RISING
AND DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE LOWER THAT YESTERDAY...INITIAL INTENSITY
IS 115 KNOTS. THERE IS NO SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM AND PERHAPS ONLY
UPWELLING IS CAUSING WEAKENING AT THIS TIME. SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY ARE FORECAST DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO. THEREAFTER
...WEAKENING IS INDICATED AS LENNY MOVES TOWARD A LESS
FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL WIND ENVIRONMENT.  IF THE THERMODYNAMICS ARE
PROPERLY ESTABLISHED...A PARAMETER I DO NOT KNOW TO FORECAST...THE
HURRICANE COULD OVERCOME THE SHEARING EFFECTS AND REMAIN STRONG A

RADAR...RECONNAISSANCE AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT THE
EYEWALL OF LENNY IS OVER ST. MAARTEN.   BECAUSE STEERING CURRENTS
ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN WEAK DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO...ONLY A
VERY SLOW MOTION TOWARD THE EAST-NORTHEAST OR NORTHEAST IS INDICATED

HOWEVER...LENNY IS STILL A STRONG HURRICANE.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN

INFORMATION FROM DUTCH ST. MAARTEN THIS EVENING INCLUDES AN
UNOFFICIAL REPORT OF 100 MPH FROM A SHIP IN SIMSON BAY...AND
MULTIPLE REPORTS OF CALM WINDS...INDICATING THAT A PORTION OF THE
EYE PASSED OVER THE ISLAND.  MORE RECENTLY THE WIND HAS BEGUN TO
PICK UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST...BUT AT SPEEDS THAT SUGGEST THEY ARE NOT
YET FULLY IN THE SOUTHERN EYEWALL...AS THE CALM IS NOW BEING
REPORTED IN ANGUILLA.  THE MOST RECENT RECONNAISSANCE REPORTS SHOW
THAT THE MINIMUM PRESSURE CONTINUES TO RISE...UP 23 MB IN TWELVE
HOURS...AND THE MAXIMUM WINDS CONTINUE TO FALL.  THE AIRCRAFT
REPORTED 107 KT AND ON THIS BASIS THE INTENSITY IS LOWERED
TO 95 KT.  THIS BRINGS LENNY DOWN TO CATEGORY TWO STATUS ON THE
SAFFIR/SIMPSON SCALE.

LENNY HAS BEEN MEANDERING OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. MODEL GUIDANCE IS
WIDELY DIVERGENT THIS EVENING...WITH AN IMPORTANT DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE UKMET AND THE AVN.  BOTH MODELS INITIALIZE A MID-LEVEL
TROUGH OFF THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES.  WHILE THE AVN BRINGS A PIECE OF
THIS TROUGH SOUTHEASTWARD...RESULTING IN AN ACCELERATION OF LENNY
AWAY FROM THE ISLANDS...THE UKMET KEEPS THE TROUGH AWAY FROM THE
CYCLONE.  THIS RESULTS IN A MUCH SLOWER...AND LESS EASTWARD MOTION
OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  IN ADDITION...THE AVN ANALYZES ANOTHER
VORTEX ABOUT 400 NM NORTHEAST OF LENNY WHICH APPEARS TO CONTRIBUTE
TO THE ACCELERATION.  INTERESTINGLY...THE UKMET HAS BEEN MUCH CLOSER
TO THE ACTUAL TRACK OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS THAN THE AVN-BASED
GUIDANCE.  IN VIEW OF THIS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND THE UKMET.  

LENNY HAS BEEN WEAKENING IN SPITE OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FAVORABLE
UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN.  THERE ARE SOME HINTS OF SOUTHWESTERLY
SHEAR UNDERCUTTING THE OUTFLOW HOWEVER.  PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO THE
SAME PATCH OF WATER MAY ALSO BE PLAYING A ROLE IN THE WEAKENING. 
THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL SUGGESTS RAPID WEAKENING TO NEAR
MINIMAL HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 24 HOURS...BUT THIS IS BASED ON THE
AVN FORECAST SHEAR WHICH MAY NOT VERIFY.  I AM FORECASTING CONTINUED
SLOW WEAKENING.

APPARENTLY IS A LOW LEVEL TROUGH TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST OF THE
HURRICANE. A MID/UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY BETWEEN FLORIDA AND BERMUDA APPEARS WEAK...AND THEREFORE MAY
NOT HAVE AS MUCH IMPACT ON THE MOTION AS THE AVN MODEL OR AVN-BASED
HURRICANE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS. THE UKMET AND NOGAPS HAVE SLOWER
NORTHEASTWARD MOTIONS THAN THE AVN...PERHAPS DUE TO THE WEAKNESS OF
THE TROUGH. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
HURRICANE GUIDANCE...SIMILAR TO BUT SLOWER THAN THE GFDL.

LENNY CONTINUES TO WEAKEN IN SPITE OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FAVORABLE
UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN.  HOWEVER...THERE ARE HINTS OF
SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR UNDERCUTTING THE OUTFLOW.  PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO
THE SAME PATCH OF WATER MAY ALSO BE PLAYING A ROLE IN THE WEAKENING.
THE SHIPS MODEL CONTINUES TO SUGGEST RAPID WEAKENING TO NEAR
MINIMAL HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 24 HOURS...PARTLY DUE TO INCREASED
VERTICAL SHEAR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A MORE CONSERVATIVE
WEAKENING...DELAYING RAPID WEAKENING UNTIL LENNY MOVES INTO THE
STRONGER WESTERLIES NORTH OF 20N.

SATELLITE IMAGES AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT LENNY
CONTINUES TO MOVE ERRATICALLY AND THE EYE IS MEANDERING BETWEEN ST.
MAARTEN AND ANGUILLA.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT STEERING CURRENTS ARE
STILL WEAK.  HOWEVER...A SERIES OF EASTWARD MOVING SHORT WAVES OVER
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC COULD FINALLY PROVIDE ENOUGH SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW
TO STEER LENNY AWAY FROM THE NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN AS INDICATED IN
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  UNFORTUNATELY...THIS MOTION IS EXPECTED TO
BE VERY SLOW SO STRONG WINDS AND HEAVY RAINS COULD CONTINUE IN THE
AREA FOR AT LEAST 12 MORE HOURS.  MODELS HAVE NOT CHANGED THEIR TUNE
AND FOR SEVERAL DAYS HAVE BEEN INDICATING A FASTER NORTHEAST TRACK
THAT HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET.  ENOUGH HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID ABOUT
MODEL OUTPUT.  

THERE HAS BEEN A GRADUAL WEAKENING SINCE YESTERDAY BUT THE HURRICANE
STILL HAS AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND BANDING FEATURES.  THE INTENSITY
FORECAST CALLS FOR A CONTINUED WEAKENING AS THE HURRICANE MOVES INTO
A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT. SHIPS MODEL INDICATE THAT ALL THE
FACTORS ARE AGAINST STRENGTHENING.  ON THE OTHER HAND...THE UK MODEL
INDICATE THAT LENNY COULD REINTENSIFY SOME.  TIME WILL TELL.

SURPRISED IF IT RESTRENGTHENS WHILE MOVING OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC.  
 
LENNY HAS BEEN MEANDERING OR MOVING ERRATICALLY DURING THE PAST 6 TO

THE CENTER IS NOT EASY TO LOCATE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY.  THE WIND AT
COOLIDGE AIRPORT ON ANTIGUA HAS SHIFTED FROM 220/10 TO 100/08 DURING
THE PAST HOUR WHICH INDICATES THAT THE CENTER PASSED VERY CLOSE TO
THIS LOCATION.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 120/03.  THE GUIDANCE
...WHICH IS STILL BASED ON THE 12Z MODEL RUNS IS DIVERGENT.  THE
NOGAPS SHOWS VERY LITTLE MOTION FOR 72 HOURS.  THE UKMET SHOWS A
NORTHEASTWARD MOTION AT ABOUT 5 KNOTS FOR 72 HOURS.  THE GFDL IS
NORTHEASTWARD ABOUT 10 KNOTS.  THE AVIATION IS DUE NORTHWARD AT
ABOUT 5 KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO AND AN UPDATE OF
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY SHOWING A SLOW EAST TO NORTHEASTWARD MOTION
FOR 72 HOURS.  BUT THE FIRST 24 HOURS OF MOTION COULD BE QUITE SLOW
AND IT COULD BE QUITE SOME TIME BEFORE THE HEAVY RAIN AND WINDS COME
TO AN END OVER PORTIONS OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.  THE EAST-
SOUTHEASTWARD MOTION WILL BRING THE CENTER RATHER CLOSE TO GUADELOPE
...BUT THE WEATHER IS NOT CONCENTRATED AROUND THE CENTER AND THE
WEATHER AT GUADELOUPE AND FURTHER SOUTH IS NOT LIKELY TO GET ANY
WORSE THAN IT HAS BEEN.
 
DURING THE PAST SIX HOURS...THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS BURST OF
DEEP CONVECTION NEAR AND TO THE EAST OF THE CENTER.  THIS COULD
DELAY THE ONGOING WEAKENING TREND AND THE OFFICIAL WIND SPEED
FORECAST IS A LITTLE SLOWER IN WEAKENING LENNY THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.

RECONNAISSANCE OBSERVATIONS THIS MORNING...THE LAST WE WILL HAVE ON
THIS SYSTEM...SHOW THAT LENNY IS NOT A WELL-ORGANIZED TROPICAL
STORM.  ALTHOUGH THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 1000 MB
FROM TWO DROPSONDES...BOTH GUADELOUPE AND ANTIGUA...WELL TO THE
WEST...HAVE REPORTED LOWER PRESSURES.  WINDS FROM THE LAST EYE DROP
SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT LOW TO MID LEVEL WESTERLY SHEAR AND REQUIRE THE
SURFACE CENTER TO BE A BIT SOUTH OF THE RECON FIX LOCATION.  THE
ONLY STRONG WINDS REPORTED AT THE 700 MB LEVEL WERE IN CONVECTION
WELL TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  BASED ON THESE WINDS...THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 50 KT.  SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO
THE WIND RADII HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE.  THE MOST RECENT INTENSITY
FORECAST GUIDANCE FROM THE SHIPS MODEL CONTINUES THE CURRENT
WEAKENING TREND. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THIS GUIDANCE.

LENNY IS FINALLY MAKING GOOD PROGRESS OUT OF THE CARIBBEAN...WITH AN
INITIAL MOTION OF 115/6.  ALL MODEL GUIDANCE TURNS LENNY FROM ITS
CURRENT EAST-SOUTHEASTERLY TRACK TO THE NORTH OR NORTHEAST
IMMEDIATELY IF NOT SOONER.  I AM A LITTLE DOUBTFUL OF THIS...GIVEN
THE RECENT TRACK OF THE STORM...AN UNCONVINCING INITIALIZATION IN
THE AVN...AND THE POOR VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF THE VORTEX. 
NONETHELESS...I HAVE MADE ONLY A MODEST EASTWARD ADJUSTMENT OF THE
OFFICIAL TRACK.

WITH LENNY MOVING OUT OF THE CARIBBEAN...AND ALL SIGNIFICANT WEATHER
EAST OF THE CENTER...ALL REMAINING WARNINGS ARE DISCONTINUED WITH
THIS ADVISORY.  ALL INTERESTS IN THE LEEWARD ISLANDS SHOULD EXERCISE
DUE CAUTION UNTIL SEAS SUBSIDE.

TOWARD AN UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.
 
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 110/6...A TRACK WHICH HAS NOT

MAYBE NUMERICAL MODELS ARE NOT ABLE TO MOVE A SLOW MOVING TROPICAL

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE LOCATED SOUTH-SOUTHEAST OF ACAPULCO HAS
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE NIGHT...AS A CONVECTIVE BAND WITH
TOPS TO -85C FORMS NEAR AND WEST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER. LATEST
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 2.0. THUS...
ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE-E. 

SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES ARE SOUTH AND WEST OF THE PREVIOUS
FIXES...SO THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN. THE BEST ESTIMATE IS
270/07. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE CENTERED NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION OVER MEXICO. THE AVN
AND NOGAPS MODELS SUGGEST THIS WILL PERSIST...AND PERHAPS EVEN DRIFT
WEST...THROUGH THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THIS SHOULD KEEP THE SYSTEM ON A
WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE AGREES WITH
THIS...ALTHOUGH THE MODELS START A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK A LITTLE TOO
SOON IF THE CURRENT MOTION IS CORRECT. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE LBAR.

THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING MODERATE EASTERLY UPPER
LEVEL SHEAR. THE AVN AND NOGAPS INDICATE THIS SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH
THE NEXT THREE DAYS. SHIPS AND SHIFOR BOTH BRING THE CYCLONE TO
HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 48 TO 72 HOURS...SHIPS DOING SO DESPITE
PERSISTENT 20 TO 25 KT SHEAR VALUES. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR
STRENGTHENING...BUT NOT AS FAST AS SHIPS AND SHIFOR. IT IS NOTABLE
THAT THE 00Z GFDL RUN DISSIPATES THE DEPRESSION AT 36 HOURS.

THE CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO REMAIN FAR ENOUGH OFFSHORE SO THAT
TROPICAL STORM WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE NOT NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.
HOWEVER...BANDS OF HEAVY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COULD MOVE ONTO
THE MEXICAN COAST FROM ACAPULCO EASTWARD...POSSIBLY PRODUCING FLASH

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE-E DISCUSSION NUMBER   2
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT FRI JUN 18 1999
 
THE CENTER OF THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE
THIS MORNING.  SATELLITE ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE  60 MILES
APART...SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 13 AND 14 NORTH...WHILE SSMI IMAGERY FROM
NRL/MONTEREY SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER MAY BE CLOSER TO 12 DEGREES
NORTH.  UNTIL WE HAVE MORE VISIBLE IMAGERY TODAY WE ARE GUIDED BY
CONTINUITY FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
285/9.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  ALTHOUGH MODEL GUIDANCE DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT THE
DEPRESSION WILL MAKE LANDFALL...BANDS OF HEAVY RAIN AND SQUALLS MAY
AFFECT COASTAL SECTIONS OF SOUTHWEST MEXICO FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.

DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS ARE 2.5 FROM TAFB AND SAB...35 KT...WHILE AIR
FORCE WEATHER AGENCY HAS 1.5.  OFFICIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 30 KT
FOR THIS PACKAGE...HOWEVER...SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE
DEPRESSION IS BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND IS EXPECTED TO REACH
TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH LATER TODAY.  THERE IS SOME EASTERLY
SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM BUT IT APPEARS TO BE RELAXING SOMEWHAT OVER
THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL BRINGS THE TD TO
65 KT IN 72 HOURS.

2 PM PDT FRI JUN 18 1999
 
EASTERLY SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE HAS RELAXED TODAY...WITH OUTFLOW
DEVELOPING IN ALL BUT THE EASTERN QUADRANT.  SATELLITE IMAGERY AND
SSM/I WINDS SPEED INFORMATION INDICATE THAT THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION
HAS STRENGTHENED AND IS NOW TROPICAL STORM ADRIAN.  

THE CENTER OF ADRIAN HAS BEEN OBSCURED BY DENSE OVERCAST ALL
DAY...BUT SSM/I IMAGERY AND A FIX FROM THE AIR FORCE WEATHER AGENCY
ARE SHOWING THAT THE CENTER HAS BEEN REORGANIZING NORTH OF OUR
PREVIOUS ESTIMATES.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS STILL SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN
BUT OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS 290/10.  THE AVN MODEL INITIAL ANALYSIS HAS
A CYCLONIC CIRCULATION TO THE WEST OF ADRIAN WHICH PROBABLY DOES NOT
EXIST.  THE GFDL MODEL...WHICH TAKES THE STORM VERY CLOSE TO THE
MEXICAN COAST...MAY BE REACTING TO THIS VORTEX.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE
IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD AND THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS A WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK THROUGH 48
HOURS.  ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT ADRIAN WILL MAKE
LANDFALL...BANDS OF HEAVY RAIN AND SQUALLS MAY AFFECT COASTAL
SECTIONS OF SOUTHWEST MEXICO FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.
 
THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST BRING ADRIAN TO HURRICANE STRENGTH
IN 48 HOURS...IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL.

8 PM PDT FRI JUN 18 1999
 
THE CENTER IS NOT WELL DEFINED TONIGHT WITH SAB AND TAFB POSITION
ESTIMATES BEING ABOUT 50 NMI APART.  USING THE TAFB POSITION GIVES
AN INITIAL MOTION OF 290/11 WHILE THE SAB POSITION GIVES 290/15.
THE TAFB POSITION AND 290/11 IS THE OFFICIAL CHOICE ALTHOUGH THIS IS
ARBITRARY.  THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL CONTINUES TO SHOW A BOGUS LOW
JUST WEST OF THE STORM.  THIS APPEARS TO BE CAUSING THE GFDL MODEL
TO MOVE THE STORM NORTHWESTWARD WHILE ALL OF THE OTHER GUIDANCE
SHOWS A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD MOTION.  SINCE THE AVIATION MODEL
SHOWS A RIDGE PERSISTING TO THE NORTH OF THE STORM...THE GFDL
SOLUTION IS REJECTED AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY FOLLOWING THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE.  THIS
KEEPS THE TRACK OFFSHORE OF THE COAST OF MEXICO.
 
ALTHOUGH DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 3.0 FROM TAFB AND 3.5 FROM
SAB...THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS WARMED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE PAST
FEW HOURS AND WHAT WAS A LARGE CDO FEATURE HAS FRAGMENTED INTO
A RATHER CHAOTIC CONVECTIVE PATTERN.  HOWEVER A SMALL CDO FEATURE
APPEARS TO BE GROWING AGAIN DURING THE LAST HOUR OR SO.  THEREFORE
THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO ONLY 45 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE
FORECAST IS FOR INTENSIFICATION TO 75 KNOTS IN 36 HOURS FOLLOWED BY
SLIGHT WEAKENING AS ADRIAN APPROACHES COOLER WATER.
 
SOME OUTER BANDS ARE PRODUCING DEEP CONVECTION AND PRESUMABLY HEAVY
RAINFALL OVER PORTIONS OF MEXICO AND THIS COULD CONTINUE FOR THE
NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO.

INFRARED AND FIRST VISIBLE IMAGERY INDICATE THAT THE TRACK REMAINS
ON A 290 DEGREE HEADING AT THE SLIGHTLY FASTER SPEED OF 14 KNOTS. 
THERE ARE NO IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THE TRACK GUIDANCE.  ALL BUT THE
GFDL SHOW A MOTION BETWEEN NORTHWEST AND WEST THROUGH 72
HOURS...EXCEPT THE BAM MODELS WHICH ACQUIRE A SOUTHWARD COMPONENT
AFTER 36 TO 48 HOURS.  THE GFDL CONTINUES TO TURN THE STORM
NORTHWARD.  THE 06Z AVIATION MODEL AGAIN HAS A RIDGE PERSISTING TO
THE NORTH OF THE STORM AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS AN UPDATE
OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY SHOWING A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION THROUGH
72 HOURS.

THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DEEP CONVECTION ALTHOUGH IT IS A BIT SPREAD
OUT AND NOT TOO SYMMETRIC.  HOWEVER THE FIRST VISIBLE IMAGES SHOWS A
NICE CDO FEATURE AND A HINT OF AN EYE-TYPE FEATURE WHICH COULD BE MY
IMAGINATION.  IN ANY CASE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 3.5 T
NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB AND KGWC AND THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASE TO
55 KNOTS.  VERTICAL WIND SHEAR DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A LIMITING
FACTOR...BASED ON THE SHIPS MODEL AND ON CIMSS SATELLITE DERIVED
WINDS.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST TAKES THE WIND SPEED TO 80
KNOTS IN 36 HOURS...A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE SHIPS AND SHIFOR
MODELS.

AGAIN...THERE IS DEEP CONVECTION AND HEAVY RAINFALL ALONG THE COAST
OF MEXICO WHICH SHOULD MOVE OFFSHORE IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS THE
STORM CONTINUES MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/13.  THERE IS NOT MUCH CHANGE IN
THE TRACK GUIDANCE BASED ON THE 12Z GLOBAL MODEL RUNS AS COMPARED TO
THE PREVIOUS RUN...EXCEPT THAT THE GFDL MODEL HAS BACKED OFF
SLIGHTLY ON ITS NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.  THEREFORE THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO AND AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY SHOWING A WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION WITH SLIGHT
DECELERATION.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE UKMET MODEL.

DVORAK ESTIMATES ARE 4.0 AND 3.5 T NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB
RESPECTIVELY.  THERE IS A SHIP FNCM LOCATED 35 NMI NORTHWEST OF THE
CENTER AT 18Z AND MOVING SOUTHWARD.  IT REPORTED ONLY 27 KNOTS AND 9
FT SEAS.  IT LOOKS LIKE THIS SHIP IS TRYING TO PENETRATE THE CENTER
OF THE STORM.  THIS SHIP IS A REASON FOR KEEPING ADRIAN JUST BELOW
HURRICANE INTENSITY WITH 60 KNOTS FOR THE INITIAL WIND SPEED.  THE
FORECAST IS FOR STRENGTHENING TO 80 KNOTS IN 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY
WEAKENING WHEN COLD SSTS ARE ENCOUNTERED.

THE WIND AND SEAS RADII IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT ARE REDUCED BASED
ON THE ABOVE MENTIONED SHIP REPORT.

THE DEEP CONVECTION IS STILL OVER PORTIONS OF THE COAST OF MEXICO
BUT SHOULD BE MOVING OFFSHORE IN THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.

8 PM PDT SAT JUN 19 1999

ADRIAN HAS BECOME THE FIRST HURRICANE OF THE 1999 EASTERN NORTH
PACIFIC HURRICANE SEASON...BASED ON SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM ALL AGENCIES.  ADRIAN HAS DEVELOPED AN IRREGULAR CENTRAL DENSE
OVERCAST AND A FEW BANDING FEATURES WHILE THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW
CONTINUES TO BE FAIR.  SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS POSSIBLE
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS BUT THEREAFTER...THE HURRICANE WILL BE
MOVING OVER COOLER THAN NORMAL WATERS AND WITHIN AN AREA OF LARGE
SCALE SUBSIDENCE AS INDICATED BY WATER VAPOR IMAGES.  A GRADUAL
WEAKENING SHOULD THEN BEGIN. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH SHIFOR AND
SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODELS.  

INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 290/13 AND THIS TRACK IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE
AS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE MOVES AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL
RIDGE CENTERED OVER MEXICO.  MOST OF THE MODELS AGREE ON A GENERAL
WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...MODELS
DIVERGE INDICATING SLOW...FAST...NORTHWEST... AND SOUTHWEST TRACKS.
THE MODELS WHICH DEPEND ON THE MEAN FLOW EXTRACTED FROM THE AVN ARE
LESS RELIABLE AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THE AVN IS INITIALIZING A STRONG-
NON EXISTENT VORTEX TO THE SOUTHWEST OF ADRIAN.  CONSEQUENTLY...A
NON-REALISTIC STEERING FLOW TOWARD THE WEST AND WEST-SOUTHWEST IS
PRODUCED.  HOWEVER...THIS LEFT BIAS IS LESS PRONOUNCED TONIGHT THAN
IN PREVIOUS RUNS.      

SHIP FNCM HAS CROSSED THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE ADRIAN DURING THE
DAY.  LATEST OBSERVATION INDICATED WEST WINDS OF 35 KNOTS AND RISING
PRESSURE. WE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE LOG FROM THAT SHIP TO DOCUMENT
ITS PATH NEAR ADRIAN.

THE EYE OF ADRIAN IS NO LONGER DISCERNIBLE IN SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS
EVENING.  MOREOVER...THE EXTEND OF DEEP CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED...
AND THE CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED.  THE CYCLONE IS NOT AS SYMMETRICAL
AS IT WAS EARLIER WITH CURRENT GOES-10 SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTING
THAT ADRIAN IS EXPERIENCING SOUTHEASTERLY SHEAR...IN AGREEMENT WITH
ANALYSIS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES...CIMSS. SST DATA SHOWS THAT ADRIAN
IS VERY NEAR THE 25C ISOTHERM.  THUS...ADRIAN HAS LIKELY PEAKED AND
IS BEGINNING TO WEAKEN.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 80 KT
FOR THIS ADVISORY...IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH TAFB AND SAB DVORAK
ESTIMATES.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A GRADUAL WEAKENING
TREND THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIDO AS ADRIAN ENCOUNTERS
PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATERS...NEAR 21-22C BY 72 HOURS.

SATELLITE-BASED POSITION ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT ADRIAN HAS BEEN
MOVING ON A MORE WESTERLY COURSE AND HAS SLOWED SOMEWHAT OVER THE
LAST 6 HOURS.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 280/8 KT.  THE
MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
STEER IT ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL 
SEVERAL DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INITIAL MOTION...AND IS IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH P91E AND CLIPER.   

THE 00Z OBSERVATION FROM SOCORRO ISLAND...18.7N/110.9W...SHOW THAT
THE WINDS ARE NORTH AT 10 KT WITH THE CENTER ABOUT 50 NM TO THE

INDICATING A DEEP LAYER WEAKNESS IN THIS AREA. THIS IS FORECAST TO
PERSIST FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS...WHICH SHOULD PRODUCE A SLOWLY-

THE LBAR AND BAMD TURN ADRIAN NORTH WITH 72 HOUR POSITIONS NORTH OF

SHEARED AND IS BEING STEERED BY LOWER-LEVEL FLOW.
 
UPPER LEVEL SHEAR AND DECREASING SSTS SHOULD CONTINUE THE CURRENT
WEAKENING TREND. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH SHIPS AND
SHIFOR...WITH ADRIAN WEAKENING TO A TROPICAL STORM IN 12 HOURS AND

ADRIAN HAS BEEN DEVOID OF DEEP CONVECTION FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS OR
MORE. IT IS BASICALLY A TIGHT SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS MOVING OVER COOL
WATERS AND TOWARD A LARGE SCALE DRY AND STABLE ENVIRONMENT AS SEEN
ON WATER VAPOR IMAGES.  DVORAK T-NUMBERS CONTINUE TO DECREASE AND
ARE NOT EVEN LOWER BECAUSE OF CONTINUITY CONSTRAINTS. IT IS KNOWN
THAT THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR EASTERN PACIFIC
SWIRLS.  LATEST HIGH RESOLUTION CLOUD MOTION VECTORS FROM THE
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN INDICATE THAT WINDS ARE ABOUT 20 KNOTS WITH
A FEW SPOTS OF 30 KNOTS. WINDS AT THE SURFACE ARE PROBABLY WEAKER
SINCE THE ENVIRONMENT IS STABLE.  ADRIAN HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A
TROPICAL DEPRESSION STATUS AT THIS TIME.

THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE MOVING SLOWLY WESTWARD
STEERED BY THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW...AS SUGGESTED BY BAM SHALLOW...UNTIL
DISSIPATION IN A DAY OR SO.  HOWEVER...THESE SWIRLS COULD LAST FOR
DAYS WITH NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER ASSOCIATED.

2 AM PDT SUN JUL 11 1999

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN THE CLOUD PATTERN OF BEATRIZ
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE CYCLONE APPEARS TO BE NEAR THE
THRESHOLD OF HURRICANE STRENGTH BUT THE CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST IS
RATHER RAGGED.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS SOMEWHAT INHIBITED OVER THE
NORTHEAST SEMICIRCLE...BUT OTHERWISE THE CLOUD FEATURES ARE WELL
ORGANIZED.  SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE ADEQUATE FOR STRENGTHENING
AS WELL.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ONE AND
SHOWS BEATRIZ BECOMING A HURRICANE LATER TODAY.  LATER IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD...MORE STABLE AIR AND DECREASING OCEAN TEMPERATURES
ARE LIKELY TO BRING ABOUT GRADUAL WEAKENING.

THE STORM CONTINUES WESTWARD AT AROUND 12 KNOTS AND THE LATEST NCEP
GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A CONTINUED WESTWARD STEERING DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  A MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE...SEEN IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY NEAR 25N 132W...COULD INDUCE A MORE NORTHWESTWARD TRACK BUT
THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW THIS FEATURE PROPAGATING SWIFTLY WESTWARD...
STAYING WELL AHEAD OF BEATRIZ.

BEATRIZ REMAINS WELL ORGANIZED WITH A 10-15 N MI DIAMETER EYE
EMBEDDED IN -60 TO -70C CLOUD TOPS.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW APPEARS
STRONG EVERYWHERE EXCEPT TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.  SOME
ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. THE CURRENT NHC
INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. 
LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...SLOW WEAKENING IS EXPECTED DUE TO
SLIGHTLY COOLER WATER AND A LITTLE LESS FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW.

MOTION IS WESTWARD NEAR 10 KNOTS.  DEEP-LAYER MEAN STEERING FORECAST
BY THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL IS WESTWARD OR SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WESTWARD
FOR THE NEXT 2-3 DAYS.  THE GFDL MODEL SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHWEST IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...
PRESUMABLY DUE TO A WEAKNESS IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE ALONG
125W/130W.  HOWEVER THIS WEAKNESS MAY BE TOO FAR NORTH TO HAVE MUCH
IMPACT ON THE STEERING.

LATEST ERS-2 SCATTEROMETER DATA FROM NAVY FLEET NUMERICAL SHOW THAT
THE WIND RADII ESTIMATES IN PREVIOUS ADVISORIES MAY HAVE BEEN TOO
LARGE...SO THE 34- AND 50-KNOT RADII HAVE BEEN REDUCED.

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SINCE 10Z INDICATES THAT THE EYE OF
BEATRIZ HAS BECOME A LITTLE LESS DISTINCT...AND THE SURROUNDING DEEP
CONVECTION HAS BECOME ASYMMETRIC. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS IS DUE
TO A CONCENTRIC EYEWALL CYCLE OR A PEAKING OF THE CYCLONE DUE TO
INTERACTION WITH COLDER WATER. DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE T5.5

INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 90 KT. THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS
SLIGHTLY CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH THROUGH 36 HOURS FOLLOWED BY GRADUAL WEAKENING DUE TO
COLDER WATER AND POSSIBLE SHEAR. ANY MOTION NORTH OF THE CURRENT
FORECAST TRACK WOULD LIKELY CAUSE A FASTER WEAKENING OVER COLDER
WATER.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/10. TRACK FORECAST GUIDANCE IS SCATTERED
AROUND A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...WITH THE BAMS...BAMM...AND
P91E MORE TO THE WEST AND THE NOGAPS AND GFDL OFF TO THE NORTHWEST.
THE 06Z GFDL IS TO THE RIGHT OF ALL OTHER GUIDANCE...CALLING FOR A

THE STRONG RIDGE SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND VARIOUS MODEL
HEIGHT FIELDS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR...BUT SLIGHTLY NORTH

HOURS AND A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THEREAFTER. SOME DECREASE IN

OF 20N.  LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...SLOW WEAKENING IS
ANTICIPATED DUE TO SST COOLING TO 24-25 DEGREES C ALONG THE

FARTHER NORTHEAST.  THE RESULT IS A LARGE ELLIPTICAL CIRCULATION
EXTENDING NEARLY 1000 N MI EAST-NORTHEASTWARD FROM BEATRIZ IN THE

OUTFLOW OF THE DISTURBANCE OFF THE MEXICAN COAST.  ALL MODEL
GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE MORE NORTHWARD TREND IS TEMPORARY...WITH
A RIDGE REMAINING TO THE NORTHWEST OF BEATRIZ.  AS THE HURRICANE
WEAKENS OVER COOLER WATER...STEERING WILL PRESUMABLY BE DETERMINED
BY A SHALLOWER LAYER FLOW.  THIS REASONING WOULD ALSO SUGGEST A
RETURN TO A MORE WESTERLY TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY

2 AM PDT WED JUL 14 1999

THE EYE OF BEATRIZ IS BECOMING RAGGED AND THE SURROUNDING CLOUD TOPS
ARE WARMING.  AS THE HURRICANE NEARS THE 25 DEG C SST ISOTHERM...IT
APPEARS TO BE GRADUALLY WEAKENING.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES AT
06Z RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 5.5...I.E. 90 TO 102 KNOTS.  CURRENT
INTENSITY IS SET AT 95 KNOTS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS
CONTINUED WEAKENING WITH A MORE RAPID DECLINE NEAR THE END OF THE
PERIOD...BY WHICH TIME IT IS EXPECTED THAT BEATRIZ WILL BE OVER 23
DEG C WATERS.

MOTION CONTINUES 295/10.  THE SLIGHT RIGHTWARD TURN OVER THE PAST 12
HOURS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF BEATRIZ...AS SUGGESTED BY THE NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL AND HINTED AT IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST IS ESSENTIALLY AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND
VERY CLOSE TO THE STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE.  AS THE SYSTEM
WEAKENS...IT SHOULD BE STEERED MORE BY THE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC
FLOW...HENCE A MORE WESTWARD MOTION IS PREDICTED LATER IN THE
PERIOD.

BEATRIZ HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN ORGANIZATION OVER THE PAST SIX
HOURS...AND THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA. THE CURRENT INTENSITY FOR THIS ADVISORY
REMAINS AT 95 KT. BEATRIZ SHOULD BEGIN A FASTER WEAKENING IN THE
NEXT 24 HOURS AS IT ENCOUNTERS COLDER WATER. THE CYCLONE SHOULD BE
OVER 22C-23C WATER BY 72 HOURS...AND IT SHOULD WEAKEN TO A MINIMAL
TROPICAL STORM OR POSSIBLY A DEPRESSION BY THAT TIME.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/10. THE AVIATION MODEL IS STILL HAVING
PROBLEMS WITH BEATRIZ...TROPICAL DEPRESSION THREE-E...AND ONE OR TWO
OTHER SPURIOUS-LOOKING VORTICES IT PRODUCES. THIS CAUSES IT AND THE
BAM MODELS TO TURN BEATRIZ SOUTH OF WEST. A WESTWARD TURN IS LIKELY
AS BEATRIZ WEAKENS AND LOW-LEVEL STEERING BECOMES DOMINANT...BUT NOT
AS SHARP AS THE TURN INDICATED BY THE BAM MODELS. THE OFFICIAL TRACK

FAIRLY DEEP CONVECTION...PRIMARILY OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN SEMICIRCLE
OF THE HURRICANE.  BEATRIZ HAS BEEN WEAKENING VERY SLOWLY UP TO THIS
POINT...BUT IT IS HEADED FOR SEA SURFACE TEMPS NEAR 23 DEG C IN A
DAY OR SO.  THEREFORE A MORE RAPID DEGENERATION OF THE SYSTEM IS
LIKELY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE
SAME AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/9.  THE CURRENT NHC TRACK FORECAST IS ONLY
SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE...NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.  A
GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE WEST IS LIKELY AS THE WEAKENING CYCLONE
BECOMES STEERED MORE BY THE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC EASTERLIES.

REPORT FROM SHIP VRUM4...WHICH CALL FOR SOME RE-LOCATION OF THE

BE MOVING WEST-SOUTHWEST...BUT THE POSITION UNCERTAINTY MAKES IT
UNWISE TO CHANGE THE MOTION THAT MUCH IN THIS PACKAGE.

NHC HURRICANE TRACK GUIDANCE BASED ON THE AVIATION MODEL MOVES THE

A FORECAST OF STRENGTHENING HAS ITS PROS AND CONS. ON THE CON

UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE SEEN EARLIER NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION HAS
WEAKENED...ALLOWING SOME NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR. ON THE PRO SIDE... THE

THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION HAS LOST ALL ITS DEEP CONVECTION...AND IT IS
QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THERE IS ANY DEFINITE SURFACE CIRCULATION
REMAINING.  SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA
ARE AMAZINGLY CLOSE...CONSIDERING THE WAY THE SYSTEM LOOKS.  INITIAL
MOTION IS 270/16...UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  BASED ON
25 KT WINDS FROM SOCORRO ISLAND EARLIER IN THE DAY THE INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 30 KT.
 
THE DEPRESSION IS EMBEDDED IN A LARGE SCALE CYCLONIC ENVIRONMENT...
FROM WHICH THE AVIATION MODEL DEVELOPS AN ADDITIONAL VORTEX THAT
TURNS THE DEPRESSION TO THE SOUTHWEST.  THE OFFICAL FORECAST CALLS
FOR WESTWARD MOTION AT A SOMEWHAT REDUCED SPEED THROUGH THE
PERIOD...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  GIVEN THE LACK OF
CONVECTION AND ORGANIZATION...DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEPRESSION TO A
TROPICAL STORM SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS TIME.

THE DEPRESSION...OR WHAT REMAINS OF IT...IS VERY DISORGANIZED WITH
INSUFFICIENT DEEP CONVECTION TO WARRANT AN INTENSITY MEASUREMENT
VIA THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE.  OBSERVATIONS FROM THE SHIP VRUM4
INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE CIRCULATION IS WEAK AND ILL-DEFINED.

CURRENT INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 25 KNOTS AND ADVISORIES MAY BE
DISCONTINUED LATER TODAY.

ALTHOUGH THE CENTER IS VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE...INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE..FOR THE SAKE OF CONTINUITY...IS 270/14.  THE TRACK
FORECAST SHOWS A CONTINUED WESTWARD MOTION...AS IN THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY...IF THE DEPRESSION SURVIVES.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION OVER THE
LAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS VERY SMALL AND
POORLY DEFINED...AND THE CONVECTIVE STRUCTURE REMAINS UNIMPRESSIVE. 
SATELLITE DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS RANGE FROM T1.5...25 KT FROM AFWA
TO 3.0...45 KT FROM SAB.  TAFB IS IN THE MIDDLE AT 30 KT.  THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  A SHIP...
ELWB8...LOCATED ABOUT 125 NM NORTHWEST OF THE CENTER REPORTED WINDS
OF ONLY 9 KT.

OUTFLOW IS APPARENT ONLY TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY MODEL STRENGTHENS THE DEPRESSION ONLY SLOWLY AND LEVELS
OFF AT ABOUT 40 KT.  GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE SYSTEM AND THE COMPETING
FLOW AROUND THE ITCZ...ONLY MODEST INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST... 
WITH THE DEPRESSION REACHING STORM STRENGTH IN 24 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/15.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND HIGH-DENSITY
CLOUD MOTION VECTORS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN/CIMSS SHOW A
LARGE MID-LATITUDE TROUGH TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST OF THE DEPRESSION. 
HOWEVER...ALL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS ENOUGH RIDGING TO THE
NORTH OF THE SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN A GENERALLY WESTERLY TRACK THROUGH
72 HOURS.

EVEN WITH VISIBLE IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON...THE CENTER OF THE
TROPICAL DEPRESSION HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO LOCATE.  THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION IS POORLY DEFINED AND APPEARS TO BE ELONGATED SOUTHEAST
TO NORTHWEST GENERALLY ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE MAIN CONVECTION. 
SATELLITE DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS RANGE FROM T1.5...25 KT FROM AFWA
TO 2.5...35 KT FROM TAFB.  OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS THE DEEP
CONVECTION HAS BEEN DIMINISHING A BIT AND THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  
 
OUTFLOW REMAINS RESTRICTED TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY MODEL BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO STORM STRENGTH WITHIN 12 H
AND TO 48 KT IN 48 HOURS.  GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE SYSTEM AND THE
COMPETING FLOW AROUND THE ITCZ...ONLY MODEST INTENSIFICATION IS
FORECAST...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN SHIPS

LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 35...35...AND 30 KT FROM
TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA RESPECTIVELY. THIS SUGGESTS THAT TROPICAL
DEPRESSION FOUR-E IS AT OR NEAR TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH. HOWEVER...
THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION IS ELONGATED WEST-NORTHWEST TO EAST-
SOUTHEAST AND...UNLESS THERE IS A TIGHT CENTER HIDDEN UNDER THE
CONVECTION...LOOKS A LITTLE LESS IMPRESSIVE THAN YESTERDAY. IN VIEW
OF THE MIXED SIGNALS...THE CYCLONE WILL REMAIN A DEPRESSION FOR THIS
PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 275/14. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NORTHWEST
OF THE DEPRESSION IS WEAKENING AND LIFTING TO THE NORTHEAST. THIS IS
ALLOWING A DEEP LAYER RIDGE TO BUILD WESTWARD WITH THE SYSTEM. MOST
LARGE-SCALE AND NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE INDICATE A GENERAL WESTWARD
MOTION SOUTH OF THIS LARGE RIDGE. THE OUTLIERS ARE THE GFDL AND
UKMET...WHICH TURN THE CYCLONE WEST-SOUTHWEST UNDER THE LARGE RIDGE.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A WESTWARD MOTION AND IS AN UPDATE
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

THE DEPRESSION REMAINS IN A LIGHT SHEAR ENVIRONMENT...WITH FAIR
OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE. THE AVIATION AND SHIPS MODELS
FORECAST THE LIGHT SHEAR TO CONTINUE...WHICH COULD ALLOW THIS SLOW-
DEVELOPING SYSTEM TO REACH TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR SLIGHT STRENGTHENING AND IS THE SAME AS THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST. WHILE THE CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO BE OVER 25C SSTS
BY 72 HOURS...THAT PROBABLY WILL HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON A SYSTEM OF

THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION CONTINUES WITH A POORLY DEFINED LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION.  IN FACT...IT IS LESS DEFINED THAN 24 HOURS AGO AND IT
SEEMS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE ITCZ WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LARGE SCALE
SATELLITE IMAGERY.  THE CONVECTION CONTINUES TO FLUCTUATE IN
INTENSITY AND IS NOW WEAKENING.  DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE EITHER STEADY
OR DECREASING INDICATING THAT THE CYCLONE REMAINS AS A TROPICAL
DEPRESSION.

THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE DEPRESSION IN 6 HOURS AND SHIPS MODEL MAKES
IT A TROPICAL STORM SOON.  ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT TREND IS WEAKENING
...I AM NOT ABOUT TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES USING IR IMAGES TO
THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST WHICH BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO STORM
STATUS.   

I DO NOT THINK THERE IS MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THIS WEAK SYSTEM
EXCEPT THAT IS LOCATED SOUTH OF A RIDGE AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
WESTWARD AS SUGGESTED BY GUIDANCE.  THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS FORECAST
TO ENTER THE NWS HONOLULU AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY LATER TODAY.

THE FIRST VISIBLE IMAGES OF THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE REVEAL A LOW-

STRONG CONVECTION.  THIS HAD ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE 2-CHANNEL IR
COMBINATION IMAGERY OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THEREFORE...ALTHOUGH
THE CLOUD PATTERN IS NOT WELL ORGANIZED...THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE
CLASSIFIED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME.  A SHEARING
ENVIRONMENT DUE TO WEST-NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW SHOULD
INHIBIT SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING...BUT ONLY SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION
WOULD BRING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS.  THIS IS SHOWN IN
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...WHICH IS IN ROUGH AGREEMENT WITH THE
STATISTICAL INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME.  NEAR THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD...COOLER WATERS ARE EXPECTED TO CAUSE WEAKENING.

PREVIOUS CENTER FIXES ARE RATHER UNCERTAIN BUT THE BEST GUESS AT

LOW-CLOUD LINES DEFINING THE CENTER OF CIRCULATION ARE NOT AS
DISTINCT AS THEY WERE SEVERAL HOURS AGO.  WEST-NORTHWESTERLY
VERTICAL SHEAR IS STILL EVIDENT...WITH THE ESTIMATED CENTER NEAR THE
NORTHWEST EDGE OF A PERSISTENT MASS OF STRONG CONVECTION.  THE
LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL
FLOW WILL BECOME MORE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  THUS ONLY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN STRENGTH IS ALLOWED
FOR...AS IN THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION IS SLIGHTLY SLOWER AND JUST A SMIDGEON TO THE LEFT OF
THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED
ACCORDINGLY.  THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO THE STATISTICAL GUIDANCE. 
DYNAMICAL TRACK MODELS ARE MORE TO THE NORTHWEST...LIKELY DUE TO A
500 MB MID-LATITUDE TROUGH SHOWN BY THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL NEAR 130W.
HOWEVER IT IS THOUGHT THAT THIS WEAK TROPICAL CYCLONE SHOULD RESPOND
MORE TO THE SHALLOW LAYER TRADEWIND FLOW...AND CONTINUE WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/13.  THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS
ABOUT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE SHOWING A CONTINUED MOSTLY
WEST-NORTHWEST OR NORTHWESTWARD MOTION WITH SOME SLOWING OF FORWARD
SPEED.  THE SLOWING DOWN IS IN RESPONSE TO AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
NEAR 130
DEGREES WEST LONGITUDE AS SEEN ON THE AVIATION MODEL.  SO THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND
SHIFTED A TAD TO THE RIGHT BASED ON THE INITIAL DIRECTION OF MOTION.

THE LOW LEVEL CLOUD LINES CONTINUE TO LOOK A LITTLE RAGGED ON
VISIBLE IMAGERY.  AN AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION PERSISTS TO THE
SOUTHEAST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER BUT THERE IS NO BANDING.  THE
INTENSITY AND INTENSITY FORECAST ARE KEPT THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS MODEL INTENSITY
GUIDANCE WHICH SHOWS COOLER SSTS NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST TRACK.

TROPICAL STORM CALVIN DISCUSSION NUMBER   4
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT MON JUL 26 1999

...CORRECTION TO CHANGE TROPICAL DEPRESSION CALVIN TO TROPICAL 
STORM AND FOR INITIAL POSITION...
 
THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIVE-E HAS NOT
IMPROVED MARKELY OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS OR SO.  THE SYSTEM REMAINS
IN A SHEARED STATE WITH THE CENTER LOCATED 0.5 TO 0.75 DEG FROM
THE EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM
BOTH TAFB AND SAB ARE 35 KT...AND TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIVE IS
UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM CALVIN.  THE 00Z AVN MODEL SUGGEST
THAT THE WESTERLY SHEAR WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.
THIS COUPLED WITH THE PROGRESSIVELY COOLER SST/S...NEAR 23C BY
36 HOURS...SHOULD PRECLUDE ANY SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS CALVIN A MINIMUM TROPICAL STORM FOR 24
HOURS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/12.  MOST OF THE DYNAMICAL MODEL
GUIDANCE SHOWS A WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 24 HOURS WITH A TURN
TO THE NORTHWEST...THEN NORTH-NORTHWEST BY 48 HOURS IN RESPONSE TO
THE MID-LEVEL TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY NEAR 30N 130W
DIGGING SOUTHWARD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK CALLS FOR A CONTINUED
WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION WITH SOME DECELERATION BY THE END OF THE
PERIOD...AND REPRESENTS A SLIGHT RIGHTWARD ADJUSTED TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE. HOWEVER...THIS TRACK IS STILL LEFT OF MOST OF THE DYNAMICAL
GUIDANCE SINCE THE CYCLONE SHOULD REMAIN WEAK...AND THUS BE STEERED
BY THE LOW-LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL FLOW.

FORECAST TO DISSIPATE BY 48 HOURS.

THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO EITHER THE TRACK FORECAST PHILOSOPHY OR

CALVIN CONTINUES TO BE STRONGLY SHEARED WITH ONLY OCCASIONAL FLARE-
UPS OF CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE 35 KT...30 KT...AND 25 KT
RESPECTIVELY. CALVIN IS THUS DOWNGRADED TO A DEPRESSION ON THIS
ADVISORY. A COMBINATION OF CONTINUED SHEAR AND COLDER SSTS SHOULD
CAUSE THE CYCLONE TO DISSIPATE IN 24 TO 36 HOURS.

THE TRACK FORECAST IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN EARLIER...AS
CALVIN MAY INTERACT WITH A TROPICAL DISTURBANCE TO ITS SOUTHWEST.
FORTUNATELY...THE CYCLONE IS LIKELY TO DISSIPATE BEFORE THE
INTERACTION IS TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST

FORECAST.

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE DISTURBANCE TO THE SOUTHWEST LOOKS JUST
AS IMPRESSIVE AS...IF NOT MORE THAN...CALVIN AT THIS TIME.
HOWEVER...SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE CURRENTLY 25 KT OR LESS

COOLER WATERS ARE ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK AND DISSIPATION IS
EXPECTED IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  HOWEVER THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT
CONVECTIVE BURST NEAR THE CENTER ALONG WITH A SUGGESTION OF
CONVECIVE BANDING EXTENDING EAST THROUGH SOUTH OF THE CENTER.  THIS

LOCATE IN INFRARED IMAGERY. HOWEVER...A JUST-RECEIVED 07Z ERS
SCATTEROMETER OVERPASS SUGGESTS THE CENTER WAS SOUTHEAST OF THE 06Z
FIXES. BASED ON THE ERS DATA...THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE
305/7. SOME RE-LOCATION OF THE CENTER MAY BE NECESSARY WHEN VISIBLE
IMAGERY BECOMES AVAILABLE.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NORTH
OF THE DEPRESSION...WHICH APPEARS WELL-ANALYZED IN THE LARGE SCALE
MODELS. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE RESPONDS TO THE TROUGH BY SUGGESTING
A MORE NORTHERLY MOTION AND A FASTER FORWARD SPEED. EVEN THE SHALLOW
BAM MODEL FORECASTS THE DEPRESSION TO BE NORTH OF 24N IN 72 HOURS...
WHICH IS SURPRISING SINCE THE AVIATION MODEL KEEPS A STRONG LOW
LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...BUT IS TO THE LEFT
AND SLOWER THAN ALL OTHER NHC GUIDANCE SAVE CLIPER. IT IS NOTABLE
THAT THE NOGAPS SUGGESTS A WESTWARD MOTION FOR THE NEXT THREE
DAYS...AS THIS COULD HAPPEN IF SIX-E IS NOT PICKED UP BY THE TROUGH.
 
THE STRONG CONVECTION SEEN EARLIER HAS DISSIPATED...LEAVING ONLY
ISOLATED CONVECTION. THERE IS NO OBVIOUS REASON FOR THIS...AS THE

TROPICAL DEPRESSION SEVEN-E HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS... WITH A CONVECTIVE BAND OVER THE SOUTHWEST SEMICIRCLE AND
SOMEWHAT DISORGANIZED CONVECTIVE BURSTS NEAR THE CENTER. SATELLITE
ESTIMATES ARE 35 AND 30 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON
THE CENTRAL CONVECTION...THE SYSTEM REMAINS A DEPRESSION ON THIS
PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/15. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH COVERING THE PACIFIC NORTH OF 20N BETWEEN
110W-130W...WITH AN UPPER LOW NEAR 16N113W. THE COMBINATION OF THESE
FEATURES SUGGESTS A NORTHWEST TRACK FOR THE DEPRESSION...WHICH IS
THE NOGAPS MODEL FORECAST. HOWEVER...THE AVN MODEL BUILDS A MID
LEVEL RIDGE WESTWARD WITH THE CYCLONE...WITH AVN-BASED GUIDANCE
AND THE GFDL INDICATING A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION. AN ADDITIONAL FLY
IN THE OINTMENT IS THE SLOW-MOVING TROPICAL LOW NEAR 12N 120W WHICH
IS GETTING BETTER ORGANIZED. THIS SYSTEM...WHICH WAS INITIALIZED TOO
FAR EAST BY BOTH THE AVN AND NOGAPS...COULD COMPLICATE THE STEERING
OF SEVEN-E IN TWO TO THREE DAYS. WITH THE LARGER THAN NORMAL
UNCERTAINTY...THE ONLY CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK WILL
BE A FASTER MOTION DURING THE FIRST 36 HOURS TO REFLECT THE INITIAL
MOTION.
 
SINCE THE CENTRAL CONVECTION IS CURRENTLY DISORGANIZED...THE
INTENSIFICATION DURING THE FIRST 12-24 HOURS IS LIKELY TO BE A
LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. THE REMAINDER OF THE
INTENSITY FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND THE SHIPS
MODEL. THE NOGAPS FORECASTS LESS SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE AFTER 24

SLIGHTLY LESS AGGRESSIVE THAN THE SHIPS GUIDANCE.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/15.  THE NOGAPS MODEL MOVES THE DEPRESSION
IMMEDIATELY ON A NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...BUT THIS FORECAST IS
QUESTIONABLE BASED ON A VERY POOR INITIALIZATION OF THE DISTURBANCE
CURRENTLY NEAR 12N120W.  THE GFDL ALSO SUGGESTS A NORTHWESTERLY
TRACK NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...IN RESPONSE TO A LARGE
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH COVERING THE PACIFIC NORTH OF 20N BETWEEN
110W-130W...AND AN UPPER LOW NEAR 16N113W.  HOWEVER...THE LBAR...
BAMS...AND UKMET...THE LAST OF WHICH IS THE ONLY MODEL TO PROPERLY
INITIALIZE THE DISTURBANCE TO THE WEST OF THE DEPRESSION...ALL
SUGGEST A MORE WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.  BASED ON THE SUPERIOR
UKMET INITIALIZATION THE NORTHWEST OPTION SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS
TIME AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ESSENTIALLY AN UPDATE OF THE

THE DEPRESSION HAS BEEN MAINTAINING ENOUGH DEEP CONVECTION AND
BANDING DURING THE DAY TO WARRANT ITS UPGRADE TO TROPICAL STORM
DORA.  SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS ARE 35 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND
25 KT FROM AFWA.  OUTFLOW IS DECENT ON THE WESTERN SIDE AND SSTS ARE
NEARLY 29C.  THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE NO REASON WHY DORA SHOULD NOT
STRENGTHEN...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REACHES HURRICANE STRENGTH
WITHIN 48 HOURS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS.

THE INITIAL MOTION HAS REMAINED STEADY AT 285/15.  THE NOGAPS MODEL
MOVES DORA INITIALLY ON A NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...BUT THIS FORECAST IS
QUESTIONABLE BASED ON A VERY POOR INITIALIZATION OF THE DISTURBANCE
THAT IS NOW TROPICAL STORM EUGENE.  ALL OTHER GUIDANCE INDICATES A
WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK FOR 48 HOURS.  AFTER THAT...THE GFDL TURNS
DORA MORE TO THE NORTHWEST WHILE THE REMAINING GUIDANCE HAS A TURN
TO THE WEST OR EVEN WEST-SOUTHWEST...IN RESPONSE TO A RIDGE BUILDING
AHEAD OF THE STORM.  THIS APPEARS TO BE THE MORE LIKELY ALTERNATIVE
AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  COMPLICATING THE FORECAST IS THE TRACK OF EUGENE...WHICH
IS NOT MOVING AS FAST AS DORA...AND MAY COME INTO PLAY NEAR THE END

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/13.  THIS IS TWO KNOTS SLOWER
THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND THE MOTION COULD BE EVEN SLOWER IF
THE SURFACE CENTER IS DIRECTLY UNDER THE SMALL PERSISTENT CDO. 
HOWEVER I AM RELUCTANT TO CHANGE THE MOTION VERY MUCH ON THE BASIS
OF INFRARED TRACKING.  THE GFDL AND NOGAPS MODELS SHOW THE STORM
SLOWING TO UNDER 8 KNOTS DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THE UKMET MODEL
IS ALSO SLOW BUT NOT AS SLOW AS THE TWO MENTIONED ABOVE.  THIS
DECELERATION IS PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF A UPPER LOW
NEAR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS CAUSING A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE
TO ITS SOUTH WHICH SHOULD SLOW DOWN THE STORM.  THE 00Z AVIATION
MODEL SUGGESTS THE RIDGE WILL NOT TOTALLY ERODE AND DORA IS
THEREFORE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE MOSTLY WESTWARD.  THE LBAR...BAM
MODELS...AND STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL MODELS ARE ALL FASTER.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SLOWED DOWN JUST A LITTLE FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

DVORAK ESTIMATES REMAIN THE SAME AS SIX HOURS AGO AND THE INITIAL
WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 45 KNOTS.  IF THE CENTER IS RIGHT UNDER THE
CDO...THE INTENSITY COULD BE HIGHER.  THE SHIPS MODEL CALLS FOR 82
KNOTS IN 60 HOURS COMPARED TO 85 KNOTS IN 60 HOURS SIX HOURS AGO. 
THIS IS BECAUSE THE PAST SIX HOUR TREND WENT FROM PLUS 10 KNOTS AT
00Z TO PLUS ZERO KNOTS AT 06Z.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS
CHANGED LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND REACHES 85 KNOTS IN 72
HOURS.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON REGULAR IR IMAGES AND WE HAVE
NOT RECEIVED ANY NEW MICROWAVE DATA LATELY.  THE CENTER APPEARS TO
BE ON THE NORTHEAST EDGE OF THE CONVECTION.  DORA HAS SLOWED DOWN
AND IS NOW MOVING 280/10.  THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO DORA'S PROXIMITY
TO A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.   MOST OF THE MODELS
...PRIMARILY THE AVN DEPENDENT...CONTINUE TO SHOW A WEST OR
WEST-SOUTHWEST TRACK IN RESPONSE TO A STRONG REBUILD OF THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  ONLY NOGAPS AND GFDI INDICATE A MORE NORTHERLY
COMPONENT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONTINUES WITH A GENERAL WESTWARD
TRACK ASSUMING THAT BOTH AVN AND UK ARE CORRECT IN REBUILDING THE
RIDGE.       

DORA HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN ORGANIZATION AS INDICATED BY LATEST
DVORAK T-NUMBERS.  THE GDFL GRADUALLY WEAKENS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE  
BUT BECAUSE...SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL...MY FAVORITE...INSISTS
ON BRINGING DORA TO 81 KNOTS...STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK.  MOST OF THE INCREASE IN INTENSITY FORECAST

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES AND MICROWAVE DATA CONFIRM THAT THE CENTER

POINT...IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT DORA MOVED NORTHWARD...IT IS MOVING
ABOUT 295/08. GLOBAL MODELS AVAILABLE AT NHC SUGGEST THAT THE
CURRENT WEAKENING IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL INDUCE A SLOW MOTION
IN DORA IN THE SHORT TERM AND BECAUSE THE RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
REBUILD...A TURN TOWARD THE WEST IS EXPECTED BEYOND 24 HOURS. THIS
IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS.    

DVORAK T-NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED A BIT BUT THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION

THE DEEP CONVECTION AROUND THE CENTER OF DORA HAS EXPANDED AND
BECOME MORE SYMMETRIC IN THE LAST 6 TO 12 HRS.  DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE 102 AND 115 KTS FROM TAFB AND SAB...RESPECTIVELY.
THE OBJECTIVE TECHNIQUE IS YIELDING 5.7 TO 5.9 OVER THE LAST FEW
HOURS.  THUS...THE INTENSITY IS BUMPED UP A NOTCH TO 110 KTS FOR
THIS ADVISORY.  DORA IS LIKELY CLOSE TO ITS PEAK INTENSITY.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A PEAK AT 12 HRS...115 KTS...FOLLOWED BY
A GRADUAL WEAKENING TREND THEREAFTER...ALONG THE LINES OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/9 KTS.  THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE
TRACK FORECAST OF DORA REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE
AS THE DEEP LAYER RIDGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO STEER THE HURRICANE ON A
GENERAL WESTERLY COURSE FOR THE NEXT 12-24 HRS FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL
BEND TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST BEYOND 24 HRS AS THE RIDGE SLIDES
EASTWARD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BAMD AND P91E.

DORA REMAINS A WELL-DEVELOPED HURRICANE WITH A 16 NM WIDE EYE AND
GOOD OUTFLOW.  THE LATEST DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT
THE HURRICANE IS PEAKING WITH MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS REMAINING AT
115 KT. DORA IS FORECAST TO REMAIN IN LIGHT SHEAR AND WARM SSTS FOR
THE NEXT THREE DAYS...SO THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR ONLY SLOW
WEAKENING. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT DORA MAY WEAKEN EVEN LESS THAN
CURRENTLY FORECAST GIVEN THE GENERALLY FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/10. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN EITHER THE
FORECAST OR THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY. THE LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE NORTH
OF DORA SHOULD REMAIN STRONG THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...WITH THE
CYCLONE CONTINUING ON A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK. NHC HURRICANE TRACK
GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO...ALTHOUGH THE
LBAR TAKES THE SYSTEM WEST-NORTHWEST AND THE UKMET MODEL WEST-

FORECAST TO REMAIN IN LIGHT SHEAR AND WARM SSTS...THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY FORECAST IS FOR MINIMAL WEAKENING OUT TO 36 HOURS.  BEYOND
THAT...DORA WILL BE MOVING OVER THE PATH OF HURRICANE EUGENE...WHICH

SOMEWHAT RESPOND TO THE TROUGH. HOWEVER...THE CURRENT FORECAST IS A
LITTLE SOUTH OF AND FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BASED ON THE
CURRENT MOTION.
 
SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANALYSES INDICATE DORA IS ABOUT TO MOVE INTO

THERE SHOULD BE ONLY A GRADUAL WEAKENING AT FIRST. THE AVN FORECASTS
20-30 KT SOUTHERLY 200 MB FLOW DEVELOPING OVER DORA BY 72 HOURS...

DORA CONTINUES TO HAVE A DISTINCT EYE BUT THE RING OF DEEP
CONVECTION HAS BEEN WARMING DURING THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. OBJECTIVE
DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE BEGINNING TO DECREASE AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
IS DECREASED ACCORDINGLY TO 115 KNOTS.  A GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD
BEGIN AS DORA MOVES OVER COOLER WATER DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THE
WEAKENING TREND IS INDICATED BY SHIPS...SHIFOR...AND AVN MODELS.
 
DORA HAS INCREASED ITS FORWARD MOTION DURING THE PAST 12 HOURS AND
IS NOW MOVING AT 270/18.  THE SYSTEM REMAINS EMBEDDED WITHIN A
STRONG DEEP LAYER OF EASTERLY WINDS WHICH IS FORECAST TO PERSIST AND
IS CLEARLY VISIBLE ON THE WATER VAPOR LOOP.  HOWEVER...IN 24 TO 36
HOURS DORA SHOULD MOVE INTO A WEAKER EASTERLY DEEP LAYER FLOW AND
BEGIN TO SLOW DOWN. THIS IS REFLECTED IN MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE.

THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE WITH AN ADJUSTMENT FOR THE FASTER SPEED.  ON THIS TRACK...A
WEAKENING DORA SHOULD BE NEARING THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS BY THE END OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.

THE EYE OF DORA IS BEGINNING TO FILL WITH CLOUD AND THE SURROUNDING
CLOUD TOPS ARE WARMING SLOWLY.  MORE STABLE TRADE WIND CLOUD CAN BE
SEEN ON SATELLITE ADVECTING INTO THE SYSTEM FROM THE NORTH AND WEST.
WHILE OUTFLOW REMAINS GOOD IN ALL DIRECTIONS...WEAKENING IS
CONTINUING. DVORAK T-NUMBERS HAVE DECREASED AND MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
NOW DOWN TO 110 KT.  GRADUAL WEAKENING IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE SHIFOR AND AVN MODELS AS THE STORM MOVES ON A
GENERALLY WESTWARD COURSE ACROSS 140W OVER SLIGHTLY COOLER SST TO
THE SOUTH OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
 
DORA CONTINUES TO MOVE WEST AT 18 KT BUT WILL GRADUALLY DROP ITS
FORWARD SPEED AS IT MOVES WEST OF THE CENTER OF THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE.  THE TRACK HAS BEEN KEPT CLOSE TO THE GFDL FOR THE FIRST 24
HOURS BUT THEN MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BAM MEDIUM AS WEAKENING
REDUCES THE EFFECT OF THE UPPER LAYER STEERING CURRENTS.  THIS WILL
BRING THE CENTER JUST SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERNMOST POINT OF THE BIG
ISLAND OF HAWAII IF DORA REMAINS ON THE FORECAST TRACK THROUGH 72
HOURS.

DORA IS WEAKENING...WITH THE EYE DISAPPEARING DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS. THE LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE ALL 102 KT...SO
THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE SET TO 100 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE. ALTHOUGH
FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY AS DORA MOVES OVER GRADUALLY COOLER
WATER...UPPER LEVEL SHEAR IS FORECAST TO REMAIN LIGHT. THE SHIPS
MODEL KEEPS DORA A HURRICANE THROUGH 72 HOURS...AND SO DOES THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/19. THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN IS SIMILAR TO 24
HOURS AGO...WITH A STRONG LOW LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF DORA AND A BREAK
IN THE MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE NEAR AND WEST OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE IS AGAIN SPLIT BETWEEN TWO POSSIBILITIES. THE
FIRST...SUPPORTED BY THE GFDL...BAMD...BAMM...AND LBAR...IS FOR A
TURN TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST WITH A TRACK JUST SOUTH OF THE ISLAND OF
HAWAII. THE SECOND...SUPPORTED BY THE P91E...P91UK...UKMET...AND
BAMS...IS FOR A MORE WESTWARD TRACK WELL SOUTH OF HAWAII. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE NORTHERN CLUSTER OF MODELS AND IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. IF DORA WEAKENS FASTER THAN
CURRENTLY FORECAST...THERE WOULD BE A GREATER CHANCE OF A MORE
WESTWARD MOTION.

THE 50 KT WINDS RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON THE OBSERVED STORM
MOTION AND WEAKENING.

THIS WILL BE THE LAST ADVISORY ON DORA ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL
HURRICANE CENTER. SUBSEQUENT ADVISORIES WILL BE ISSUED BY THE
CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER IN HONOLULU HAWAII.

THE ATOLL FROM ANY DAMAGING WIND OR SURF. THE SURF LIKELY WAS THE

INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE 285/5...BUT WITH MORE THAN THE
USUAL UNCERTAINTY.  MID-LEVEL WINDS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN/CIMSS SHOW A LARGE RIDGE AHEAD OF EUGENE THAT SHOULD KEEP
THE STORM ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WEST TRACK DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INCREASES THE SPEED TO MORE
CLIMATOLOGICAL VALUES TOWARDS THE END OF THE PERIOD.

THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL BRINGS EUGENE TO ABOUT 55 KT...
BUT THIS IS BASED ON THE LBAR TRACK WHICH IS OVER SIGNIFICANTLY
COOLER WATERS THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  EVEN SO...THE ENVIRONMENT
AHEAD OF THE STORM DOES NOT LOOK ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE...AND THE

THE IR CONVECTIVE PATTERN APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE DISTORTED TO THE
SOUTH.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN THE SAME AS SIX HOURS AGO.
THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 35 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST IS TO 60
KNOTS AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE SHIPS MODEL GOES A LITTLE
HIGHER BUT THE LACK OF APPARENT RECENT STRENGTHENING IS THE BASIS
FOR CONSERVATISM.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/08.  THE STORM IS NEARING THE
LONGITUDE OF MAXIMUM WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH AND ALL OF
THE GUIDANCE EXCEPT THE NOGAPS SHOWS A MOSTLY WESTWARD ACCELERATION
DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MOTION INCREASES TO
ABOUT 10 KNOTS IN 48 HOURS WHICH IS MORE OR LESS IN THE MIDDLE OF

THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH EUGENE HAS NOT CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE PAST 12 HOURS AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
REMAINS AT 35 KNOTS.  AS IN THE CASE OF DORA...GFDL WEAKENS THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE WHILE SHIPS MODEL STRENGTHEN IT...BUT ONLY TO 64
KNOTS. INTENSIFICATION IS MAINLY DUE TO LOW SHEAR AND WARM
WATERS...ACCORDING TO THE SHIPS OUTPUT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
BRINGS EUGENE TO 60 KNOTS IN AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS AND THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/08.  ALL MODELS EXCEPT
NOGAPS...WHICH MAINTAINS EUGENE MEANDERING... SUGGEST A WEST AND
EVEN A WEST-SOUTHWEST TRACK.  THIS MOTION IS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE
A DEVELOPING SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE STORM
INDICATED BY GLOBAL MODELS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN BETWEEN THE
MODELS AND CALLS FOR A WESTWARD TRACK WITH A SMALL INCREASE IN

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW A CLOUD BAND WRAPPING AROUND THE

IF THE TREND CONTINUES...EUGENE MAY INTENSIFY FASTER THAN 
ANTICIPATED. INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 50 KNOTS AT THIS
TIME AND A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED.  THIS BASED ON SHIPS
MODEL...AND THE PREVAILING LOW SHEAR AND WARM SST. HOWEVER...
RELATIVELY STABLE AIR IS ALONG THE FUTURE PATH OF THE STORM.  THIS
IS NOT VERY FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING.  
 
INITIAL NOTION IS 285/09.  A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO

NOGAPS MODELS INDICATE AN MID/UPPER LEVEL BREAK IN THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE NORTH OF EUGENE NEAR THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS DURING THE FORECAST

UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER THE STORM WILL TURN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST
OR CONTINUE GENERALLY WESTWARD NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE POSSIBILITIES
AND IS CLOSEST TO THE BAMD.
 
THE SOMEWHAT RAGGED CLOUD PATTERN SUGGESTS EUGENE IS CURRENTLY
SUFFERING SOME EASTERLY SHEAR. THE AVN AND NOGAPS BUILD AN UPPER

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES HAVE LOWERED ON EUGENE AND ARE NOW 77
AND 65 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...RESPECTIVELY.  MOST OF THE CONVECTION
IS NOW EAST OF THE PRESUMED CENTER...PROMPTING SAB TO USE THE SHEAR
PATTERN IN ITS CLASSIFICATION.  OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS LOWERED TO 75
KT.  WITH LOW SHEAR FORECAST AND SUFFICIENT SSTS...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR ONLY MODEST ADDITIONAL WEAKENING DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD...IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY
MODEL.

THE FORECAST TRACK PRESENTS SOMETHING OF A CHALLENGE.  ALL THE
GLOBAL MODELS BUILD A MID-LEVEL RIDGE AHEAD OF EUGENE...WITH THE
ECMWF AND UKMET SHOWING A BREAK IN THE RIDGE TO THE EAST OF HAWAII. 
THE AVN SHOWS A WEAKNESS NEAR THE ISLANDS...AND THE NOGAPS EXTENDS
THE RIDGE MUCH FARTHER TO THE WEST.  WHICH OF THESE VERIFIES GREATLY
DETERMINES THE THREAT OF EUGENE TO HAWAII.  ANOTHER FACTOR IS HOW
QUICKLY EUGENE SPINS DOWN.  A STRONGER STORM WILL LIKELY MOVE WITH
THE DEEP LAYER FLOW AND TRACK CLOSER TO THE ISLANDS...WHILE IF
EUGENE WEAKENS FASTER THAN FORECAST...IT SHOULD STAY WELL TO THE
SOUTH.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE FOR THIS PACKAGE IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF
THE PREVIOUS SET OF MODEL RUNS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NUDGED
SOUTH AS WELL...IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL AND THE BAM MODELS.
 
THE NOAA GULFSTREAM IV JET AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN TASKED TO FLY IN THE
ENVIRONMENT OF HURRICANE EUGENE ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON TO HELP
PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE SYNOPTIC STEERING CURRENTS.

WITH EUGENE CROSSING PAST 140 DEGREES LONGITUDE...RESPONSIBILITY FOR
FUTURE ADVISORIES NOW PASSES TO THE CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE
CENTER.

EUGENE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING THE PAST 6 HOURS...LOSING MOST OF ITS
DEEP CONVECTION THEN HAVING THE DEEP CONVECTION WRAP ONCE AGAIN
AROUND THE EAST AND NORTH FLANKS OF THE LLCC. INFRARED SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOWS EUGENE STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SOUTHEASTERLY
SHEAR WHICH IS HAMPERING ANY STRENGTHENING. THE MODEST SHEARING PLUS
MARGINAL SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK CALLS FOR
A SLOW WEAKENING OF EUGENE THROUGH 72 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY
IS STILL AT 75 KT.

INITIAL MOTION IS 275/13. THE FORECAST MORE OR LESS KEEPS EUGENE ON
A SLIGHTLY NORTH OF A DUE WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS. THE BAMD

HURRICANE EUGENE CONTINUES ON A SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WEST TRACK AND
MOST OF THE MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH A WEST NORTHWEST MOVEMENT
DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS. OUTFLOW REMAINS FAIR IN ALL QUADRANTS BUT
CONVECTION IS AGAIN GOING THROUGH A PERIOD OF DECAY AFTER A MORNING
PEAK. WHETHER THIS ACTUALLY MEANS EUGENE IS BEGINNING TO WEAKEN
FURTHER IS UNCERTAIN. THE ENVIRONMENTAL SHEAR OVER EUGENE IS NOT
SIGNIFICANT AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ALONG THE 26 DEG CELSIUS
ISOTHERM UNTIL SLIGHTLY COOLER WATERS ARE ENCOUNTERED WEST OF 150W.
AS A RESULT EUGENE IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN ONLY SLOWLY.

ALTHOUGH DEEP CONVECTION CONTINUES TO COME AND GO AND THERE HAS BEEN
NO DISCERNABLE EYE FOR QUITE AWHILE...EUGENE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF
WEAKENING. LOOKS LIKE THE SOUTHERLY SHEAR NOTICED ON SATELLITE
IMAGERY IS NOT ENOUGH TO WORK ON EUGENE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
THEREFORE KEEPS EUGENE AT 70 TO 75 KT THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND
BEGINS THE SLOW WEAKENING PROCESS THEREAFTER. SHIPS DATA SAYS THAT
IT WONT BE UNTIL AFTER 24 HOURS THAT EUGENE SEES SLIGHTLY LOWER SEA
SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN VERTICAL SHEAR.

INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 280/11. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
AN EXTENSION OF THE LAST FORECAST...MOVING EUGENE SLIGHTLY NORTH OF

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THAT WAS LOCATED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES
SOUTHWEST OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA HAS GOTTEN BETTER
ORGANIZED DURING THE DAY.  A WELL DEFINE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION IS
EVIDENT IN THE VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY.  WIND SPEEDS COMPUTED FROM
SEVERAL OF THE LOW LEVEL CLOUD ELEMENTS GIVE VALUES THAT RANGE FROM
20 TO ALMOST 30 KNOTS.  ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE CIRCULATION IS EXPOSED
ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER DEEP CONVECTION
HAS BEEN PERSISTING ON THE WESTERN SIDE.  T-NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED
AND ARE NOW 2.0 FROM BOTH SAB AND MIAMI.  THEREFORE...THE
DISTURBANCE IS UP-GRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION NINE-E.

INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 285/12.  THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO
MOVE IN THIS GENERAL DIRECTION UNTIL IT COMES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
THE RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST...AT WHICH TIME IT SHOULD TAKE MORE OF A
WESTERLY DIRECTION SIMILAR TO ITS PREDECESSORS.  THE GUIDANCE MODELS
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO.

INTENSITY GUIDANCE MODELS DEVELOP THE SYSTEM RATHER SLOWLY.  PART OF
THIS MAY BE DUE TO SLIGHTLY COOLER SSTS CAUSED BY THE UP-WELLING
FROM THE PASSAGE OF EUGENE AND DORA AS WELL AS A MORE STABLE
ENVIRONMENT LEFT IN THEIR WAKE.

ALTHOUGH ASSOCIATED DEEP CONVECTION IS DISORGANIZED...TROPICAL
DEPRESSION NINE-E HAS A LARGE AND WELL-DEFINED LOW LEVEL
CIRCULATION. THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE SET TO 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY IN
AGREEMENT WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/12. MOST NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE TURNS THE
CYCLONE WESTWARD OVER THE NEXT 48 TO 72 HOURS UNDER A DEEP LAYER
RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST...WITH THE ONLY QUESTION THE LATITUDE AT
WHICH THE TURN WILL OCCUR. THE NOGAPS OFFERS A ALTERNATE
SCENARIO...WITH A TROUGH ALONG THE U.S. WEST COAST DIGGING FAR
ENOUGH SOUTHWARD TO BREAK THE RIDGE AND MOVE THE CYCLONE
NORTHEASTWARD. CURRENT WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUPPORTS THE WESTWARD
MOTION...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.

CIRRUS CLOUD MOTIONS INDICATE AN ANTICYCLONE OVER THE CONVECTION...
WHICH IS DISPLACED WEST AND NORTHWEST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER. THIS
SUGGESTS EASTERLY SHEAR. THE AVN AND NOGAPS SUGGEST THE SHEAR MAY
DECREASE AS THE DEPRESSION GAINS LATITUDE. HOWEVER...THE EXPECTED
GAINING WOULD BRING THE CYCLONE OVER COOLER WATER. THE SHEAR IS
LIKELY TO SLOW INTENSIFICATION EARLY IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND
THE COMBINATION OF A LARGE SYSTEM AND COOLER WATER IS LIKELY TO SLOW
INTENSIFICATION LATER IN THE PERIOD. THUS...THE FORECAST IS FOR SLOW

DYNAMIC-BASED GUIDANCE IS STILL DIVERSE WITH NOGAPS BRINGING THE
CYCLONE NORTH AND DISSIPATING IT BY 36 HRS WHILE THE UKMET MOVES THE
SYSTEM WEST-NORTHWEST THROUGH 24 HRS BEFORE MAKING A SHARP LEFT TURN
TOWARD THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST. IN BOTH INSTANCES EACH MODEL FAVORS THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A SYSTEM NEAR THE COAST OF MEXICO. THE REMAINDER OF
THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE AGREES ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION
THROUGH 24 HRS WITH A MORE WESTERLY HEADING THEREAFTER. THE PRIMARY
DIFFERENCES LIE IN THE FORWARD MOTION WITH THE GFDL BEING THE
SLOWEST OF WHILE LBAR AND P91E THE FASTEST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN CLIPER AND P91E ALTHOUGH CONSIDERABLY SLOWER
...IN LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
ANALYSES FROM THE CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN INDICATE THAT
15-20 KT EASTERLY/SOUTHEASTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR EXTENDS TO NEAR
125W N OF 12N. THE LATEST AVAILABLE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL OUTPUT DEPICTS
THIS FAIRLY WELL AND SUGGESTS THAT THE SHEAR WILL DIMINISH TO NEAR 
10 KT BY 36 HRS. HOWEVER...THE FORECAST TRACK BRINGS THE SYSTEM OVER
GRADUALLY COOLER WATER. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING WITH FERNANDA FORECAST TO REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH BY
72 HRS...IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS.

DISAPPEARED UNDER THE DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. THE
LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 45 KT FROM SAB AND 35 KT
FROM TAFB AND AFWA. THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY IS SET TO 40 KT FOR THIS
ADVISORY.

SINCE CONVECTION HAS SPREAD OVER THE PREVIOUSLY EXPOSED CENTER...THE
INITIAL MOTION HAS AGAIN BECOME UNCERTAIN. THE BEST ESTIMATE IS
295/11...WHICH IS THE 12 HOUR MOTION. THE AVN BASED GUIDANCE AND THE
GFDL INDICATE A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST TO WEST MOTION...WHILE THE
UKMET AND THE NOGAPS DRASTICALLY SLOW THE SYSTEM OR TURN IT BACK TO
THE EAST IN RESPONSE TO THE DISTURBANCE SOUTHWEST OF ACAPULCO. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO POSSIBILITIES...
INDICATING A SLOWING OF THE WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD.

ANALYSES FROM THE CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CONTINUE TO
INDICATE 15-20 KT EASTERLY/SOUTHEASTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR NEAR
FERNANDA. THIS IS ABOUT A 15 KT DECREASE FROM YESTERDAY. THE AVN AND
SHIPS MODELS FORECAST A FURTHER DECREASE IN THE SHEAR...WHICH SHOULD
ALLOW A FASTER DEVELOPMENT. THE INTENSITY FORECAST REFLECTS THIS AND
BRINGS FERNANDA TO HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 36 HOURS. AFTER THAT...THE
CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO COOLER WATER WHICH IS LIKELY TO
STOP INTENSIFICATION.

THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH FERNANDA HAS CHANGED LITTLE DURING

A STRONG CLUSTER TO THE WEST OF THE CENTER. SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM SAB AND TAFB REMAIN ABOUT 3.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE SO
INITIAL INTENSITY IS UNCHANGED. FERNANDA HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME
STRENGTHENING BEFORE REACHING COOL WATER IN 36 HOURS OR SO. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 290/11.  MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS SUGGEST THAT A
GRADUAL TURN MORE TO WEST SHOULD BEGIN IN 36 HOURS AS A STRONG MID-
LEVEL RIDGE DEVELOPS TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. FERNANDA
SHOULD MOVE A LITTLE FASTER AS IT WEAKENS AND BECOME STEERED BY THE

SATELLITE MICROWAVE IMAGERY AND SHIP REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE BROAD
TROPICAL DISTURBANCE NEAR THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA NOW
HAS A SUFFICIENTLY WELL-DEFINED SURFACE CIRCULATION TO BE CLASSIFIED
AS TROPICAL DEPRESSION ELEVEN-E.  THIS MORNING CONVECTION INCREASED
AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS BECAME MORE COHERENT.  THE DEPRESSION IS
CLOSE TO COLD WATER AND CONVECTION IS ALREADY DECREASING...SO I
EXPECT THE DEPRESSION TO BE SHORT-LIVED.

INITIAL LOCATION AND MOTION ARE QUITE UNCERTAIN AS THE CENTER IS
HARD TO FIND...BUT THE MOTION IS ESTIMATED AS 315/3.  MODEL GUIDANCE
TAKES THE DEPRESSION AWAY FROM THE COAST AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS SUIT...A COMPROMISE BETWEEN CLIPER AND THE SHALLOW BAM.

FURTHER NORTH AND IS NOW ABOUT 150 MILES WEST OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF
BAJA CALIFORNIA. THIS POSITION PLACES IT CLOSE TO THE 24 DEGREE
CELSIUS ISOTHERM AND ITS CURRENT NORTHWESTWARD TRACK WILL RAPIDLY

DECREASED DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS AND IS NOW MAINLY TO
THE SOUTH. THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE HELD AT 30 KNOTS FOR THE FIRST 12
HOURS WITH WEAKENING THEREAFTER AND DISSIPATION AFTER 48 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 315/8. THERE IS MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE CURRENT
LOCATION BASED ON CLOSER AGREEMENT OF SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB...
SAB AND GWC. THE MODEL FORECASTS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH A
NORTHWEST TRACK INTO COLDER WATER. THE NEW TRACK IS SLIGHTLY NORTH

THE LARGE MONSOON-TYPE DISTURBANCE THAT HAS PERSISTED OFF THE
MEXICAN COAST FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED
ABOUT 50 MILES SOUTHWEST OF MANZANILLO. SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 30 KT...SO ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED
ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE-E.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN...WITH THE BEST ESTIMATE OF 340/06.
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES AN ANTICYCLONE OVER NORTHERN MEXICO
WITH LARGE UPPER LEVEL LOW DEVELOPING WEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
THIS SUGGESTS A NORTHWESTWARD MOTION...WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE NHC
HURRICANE GUIDANCE. THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST STARTS WITH A SLOW
NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION THAT TURNS MORE NORTHWEST IN TIME.

THE DEPRESSION HAS GOOD CONVECTIVE BANDING AND GOOD OUTFLOW...AND
THUS COULD BECOME A TROPICAL STORM THIS AFTERNOON. THE FORECAST
TRACK KEEPS THE SYSTEM OVER WARM WATER...SO GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST WITH THE CYCLONE REACHING HURRICANE STRENGTH IN ABOUT 48
HOURS.

DUE TO THE EXPECTED STRENGTHENING AND PROXIMITY TO THE MEXICAN
COAST...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE BEING ISSUED FOR THE AREA
BETWEEN MANZANILLO AND CABO CORRIENTES...AS WELL AS FOR THE ISLAS
MARIAS. THE CYCLONE COULD THREATEN OTHER PARTS OF THE MEXICAN

HOURS DUE TO PROXIMITY TO LAND. AFTER THAT TIME...STEADY

THE CENTER IS NOT WELL-DEFINED BUT THE HEADING NOW APPEARS TO BE
NORTHWESTWARD.  STEERING FLOW ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE OF A MID-LEVEL

TROPICAL STORM GREG DISCUSSION NUMBER   5
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT MON SEP 06 1999
 
GREG IS NEARING HURRCIANE STRENGTH. THE MEXICAN RADAR AT LOS CABOS
INDICATES AN EYE FORMING...AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB AND SAB ARE 55-60 KT AND 55 KT RESPECTIVELY. THE MAXIMUM
SUSTAINED WINDS ARE SET TO 60 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY...AND GREG WILL
LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO A HURRICANE LATER TODAY...IF IT IS NOT ONE
ALREADY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS SET TO THE 12 HOUR MOTION OF 300/9...ALTHOUGH
THE SHORT TERM MOTION MAY BE MORE WESTERLY. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES INDICATES A MID/UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER NORTHWEST
MEXICO AND A MID/UPPER LEVEL LOW NEAR 30N124W. THE MEXICAN RIDGE
FAVORS A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE NHC
GUIDANCE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHFITED SOMEWHAT SOUTH OF
THE PREVIOUS TRACK BASED ON THE INITIAL POSITION AND THE MORE
WESTERLY MOTION. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW COULD CAUSE A MORE NORTHERLY
TRACK LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. HOWEVER...GREG WILL BE WEAKENING
OVER COLD WATER BY THAT TIME...SO THE LOW MAY NOT HAVE MUCH OF AN
EFFECT.
 
GREG CONTINUES TO HAVE STRONG CONVECTION AND GOOD OUTFLOW...SO
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST UNTIL IT MOVES OVER COLDER WATER...WHICH
STARTS AT ABOUT 110W. STEADY WEAKENING SHOULD OCCUR THEREAFTER.

HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE BEING ISSUED FOR THE SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA
PENINSULA BASED ON THE CURRENT FORECAST TRACK...WIND RADII...AND THE
INHERENT UNCERTAINIES IN BOTH.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT MON SEP 06 1999
 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 65 KT...SO GREG
IS UPGRADED TO A MINIMAL HURRICANE. AT LEAST A PARTIAL EYE HAS BEEN
PRESENT ON THE LOS CABOS RADAR DURING THE DAY. THAT BEING SAID...THE
SYSTEM IS GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF BEING SHEARED. THERE IS NO
OUTFLOW TO THE NORTHEAST SIDE...AND SOME OF THE LOW CLOUD LINES
NORTHEAST OF THE EYE ARE EXPOSED. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND VERTICAL
SHEAR ANALYSES FROM CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SUGGEST
LESS THAN 20 KT OF SHEAR...SO THE RAGGED APPEARANCE IS A BIT
PUZZLING. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A LITTLE MORE
INTENSIFICATION BEFORE GREG HITS COOLER WATER...FOLLOWED BY STEADY
WEAKENING. 

THE MOTION HAS BEEN A LITTLE ERRATIC AT TIMES...BUT IS ESTIMATED TO
BE 305/6. THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED FROM SIX HOURS
AGO...WITH RIDGING OVER NORTHWEST MEXICO NORTH OF GREG AND AN UPPER
LEVEL LOW NEAR 29N125W. THIS WOULD SUGGEST A CONTINUED WEST-
NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION. HOWEVER...THE TRACK FORECAST GUIDANCE
IS QUITE DIVERSE...WITH FORECASTS RANGING FROM STRAIGHT NORTHWEST TO
A TURN TO THE WEST-SOUTHWEST. THE SPEEDS ARE ALSO DIVERSE...WITH THE
GFDL...NOGAPS...UKMET..AND AVN BEING VERY SLOW AND THE OTHER
GUIDANCE BEING FASTER. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE...EXCEPT AT 72 HOURS WHERE IT IS SHIFTED TO THE
SOUTH. IT IS DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF BOTH
DIRECTION AND SPEED.

HURRICANE GREG DISCUSSION NUMBER   7
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT MON SEP 06 1999
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/07.  THIS BRINGS THE CENTER OF
THE HURRICANE TO WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA
CALIFORNIA IN 12 HOURS.  THEREAFTER THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
INDICATE MOTIONS RANGING BETWEEN WEST AND NORTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST TURNS THE HURRICANE WESTWARD...FOLLOWING THE
GFDL...UKMET...NOGAPS AND BAM MODELS.

THE DEEP CONVECTION IS NOT LOOKING VERY IMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE
IMAGERY AND IS MOSTLY SOUTH OF THE CENTER.  BUT LOS CABOS RADAR
SHOWS A FAIRLY WELL DEFINED EYE...EXCEPT IT IS OPEN TO THE NORTH. 
GREG IS APPROACHING COLD SSTS AND THE WESTERN THIRD OF ITS
CIRCULATION IS ALREADY OVER COLD WATER.  SO THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE
OPPORTUNITY FOR STRENGTHENING...PERHAPS UP TO 70 KNOTS IN 12 HOURS
BUT EVEN THIS IS NOT LIKELY.

IF THE STRONG WINDS ARE CONFINED TO THE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION...IT
IS POSSIBLE THAT BAJA CALIFORNIA COULD MISS THE WORST OF THIS
HURRICANE.  SO FAR THE WINDS AT SAN JOSE DEL CABO HAVE ONLY BEEN UP
TO 12 KNOTS.  THIS WILL BE RESOLVED IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS.

HURRICANE GREG DISCUSSION NUMBER   8
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT TUE SEP 07 1999

THE FORWARD SPEED HAS SLOWED A BIT...AND LATEST RADAR IMAGES FROM
LOS CABOS INDICATE THAT THE CENTER HAS NOT YET PASSED THE LONGITUDE
OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA.  THE EYEWALL APPEARS OPEN ON
THE NORTHERN SIDE...SO STRONGEST WEATHER EFFECTS ARE ON THE SOUTH
SIDE OF THE EYE AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF
CONVECTIVE ELEMENTS ROTATING AROUND TO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
CYCLONE DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  IF THIS OCCURS...CONDITIONS IN
THE CABO SAN LUCAS AREA COULD WORSEN. 

GREG IS NOT AS WELL ORGANIZED ON SATELLITE IMAGES AS IT WAS ON
MONDAY..WITH LESS DEEP CONVECTION AS WELL.  BUT THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE
STILL GIVES A CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 65 KNOTS.  NOT FAR TO
THE WEST OF CABO SAN LUCAS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GRADIENT OF SEA
SURFACE TEMPERATURES.  THEREFORE ONCE THE CENTER MOVES A FEW DEGREES
FARTHER WESTWARD...GREG WILL ENCOUNTER SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER WATERS. 
WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN IN 24 HOURS OR SO.

THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE. A
LARGE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW NORTH OF 25N AND WEST OF 120W COULD
CAUSE A MORE NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION LATER IN THE PERIOD...BUT
THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECAST SHOWS THIS LOW LIFTING NORTHWARD WITH TIME
AND THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL LIKELY BE RESPONDING MORE TO LOWER-
TROPOSPHERIC STEERING IN 2-3 DAYS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT TUE SEP 07 1999
 
EARLY MORNING VISIBLE IMAGES INDICATE GREG IS...AT BEST...BARELY A
MINIMAL HURRICANE...WITH THE LOW LEVEL CENTER EXPOSED ON THE
NORTHEAST EDGE OF THE CONVECTION. CIRRUS CLOUDS FROM A CONVECTIVE
BAND NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER ARE BLOWING ACROSS THE CENTER...
INDICATING MODERATE TO STRONG SHEAR. IF CURRENT TRENDS CONTINUE...
GREG WILL BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM LATER TODAY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS THE 12 HOUR MOTION OF 315/4...ALTHOUGH RECENT
SATELLITE FIXES INDICATE A MORE NORTHERLY SHORT TERM MOTION. A WELL
DEFINED ANTICYCLONE IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER NORTHERN MEXICO
SHOULD PRODUCE A NORTHWEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION FOR THE NEXT DAY
OR TWO. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE REFLECTS THIS...ALTHOUGH AS SEEN
YESTERDAY...THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF SPREAD IN THE 72 HOUR FORECAST
POINTS BETWEEN A NORTHWEST MOTION AND A TURN TO THE WEST-SOUTHWEST.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...SHIFTED
A LITTLE TO THE NORTH EARLY ON DUE TO THE MORE NORTHERLY POSITION.

SHEAR IS TAKING ITS TOLL ON GREG...AND THE CENTER WILL PASS NEAR THE
SOUTH END OF BAJA CALIFORNIA DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS. AFTER
THAT... IT WILL ENCOUNTER COLDER WATER. THE COMBINATION OF THE THREE
EVENTS SHOULD PRODUCE WEAKENING...AND THE INTENSITY FORECAST
REFLECTS THIS.

2 PM PDT TUE SEP 07 1999
 
CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH GREG HAS DECREASED AND BECOME VERY
DISORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON IN BOTH SATELLITE AND RADAR DATA.
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM SAN JOSE DEL CABO HAVE SHOWN WINDS OF LESS
THAN TROPICAL STORM FORCE AND A LOWEST PRESSURE OF ABOUT 1003 MB.
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB HAVE DECREASED TO 55
KT AND 45 KT RESPECTIVELY. GREG IS THUS DOWNGRADED TO A 50 KT
TROPICAL STORM.

GREG MOVED ALMOST DUE NORTH FOR A TIME TODAY...BUT HAS NOW TAKEN A
COURSE OF 330/4. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN EITHER THE FORECAST
PHILOSOPHY OR THE FORECAST GUIDANCE FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. GREG
IS EXPECTED TO MOVE GENERALLY NORTHWEST UNDER THE MEXICAN RIDGE...
FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST AS IT WEAKENS AND LOW LEVEL
STEERING BECOMES DOMINANT.

STRONG SHEAR HAS CAUSED GREG TO WEAKEN UP TO NOW...AND THE CYCLONE
WILL ENCOUNTER COLDER WATER AFTER CROSSING BAJA CALIFORNIA. THE TWO
NEGATIVE FACTORS SHOULD CAUSE FURTHER WEAKENING. THE INTENSITY
FORECAST CALLS FOR GREG TO BE DISSIPATING BY 72 HOURS. THERE IS A
CHANCE IT COULD WEAKEN MORE RAPIDLY THAN FORECAST HERE.

SATELLITE IMAGES AND SURFACE REPORTS INDICATE THAT GREG CONTINUES TO
WEAKEN.  HOWEVER...THE CENTER IS STILL LOCATED UNDER A SMALL AREA OF
DEEP CONVECTION WHICH IS MOVING AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA
CALIFORNIA. DATA FROM THE AREA AND SHIP WVDG CLEARLY DEFINE THE
CIRCULATION AND LOCATION OF GREG WITH WINDS OF 25 TO 30 KNOTS. 
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS WERE REPORTED EARLIER FROM THE SOUTHERN
TIP OF BAJA.  
 
GREG IS MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST ABOUT 6 KNOTS AND THIS TRACK IS LIKELY
TO CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO... AS INDICATED BY MOST OF
THE GUIDANCE.  ON THIS TRACK...THE CIRCULATION WILL BE OVER COOL
WATERS AND WEAKENING SHOULD OCCUR AT MUCH FASTER RATE AS SUGGESTED

EASTERLY SHEAR CONTINUES TO IMPACT THE SYSTEM...AND CURRENT DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE DOWN TO MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH. 
THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF SHEAR AND COLDER WATERS SHOULD CAUSE GREG TO
CONTINUE TO SPIN DOWN AND THE SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO BE IN THE
DISSIPATION STAGE LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

MOTION IS SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST.  SINCE GREG IS LIKELY TO

TRAJECTORY SIMILAR TO THE SHALLOW BAM GUIDANCE.  THIS IS FAIRLY
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY PACKAGE.

9 AM PDT FRI SEP 17 1999

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS
MUCH CLOSER TO THE DEEP CONVECTION AND BETTER DEFINED. IN
ADDITION...SHIPS IN THE AREA INDICATE THAT PRESSURES ARE LOW ENOUGH
TO CLASSIFY THIS SYSTEM AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  THE OCEAN IS WARM
BUT UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE FAVORABLE FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING. THE
DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO BECOME A TROPICAL STORM WITHIN THE NEXT 12
TO 24 HOURS.

WE DO NOT HAVE A GOOD ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION BUT BEST
ESTIMATE IS 295/10. THIS GENERAL TRACK SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD AS INDICATED BY THE UK MODEL AS WELL AS CLIMATOLOGY.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS THE SYSTEM FAR ENOUGH FROM THE MEXICAN
COAST THAT WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.

THE CYCLONE IS STILL TRYING TO BECOME ORGANIZED AND SATELLITE
CLASSIFICATIONS INDICATE THAT IT IS NEARING THE THRESHOLD OF STORM
STRENGTH.  A STRONG BURST OF CONVECTION IS OCCURRING NEAR THE
ESTIMATED CENTER...BUT BANDING FEATURES ARE NOT YET WELL-DEFINED.
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS BEING RESTRICTED OVER THE NORTHEAST PORTION
OF THE SYSTEM...AND THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE
RATHER SLOW RATE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN RATHER SLOW THUS FAR.  SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST...AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND SIMILAR
TO THE SHIPS OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE.

SINCE THE CENTER IS NOT EASY TO FIND...THE MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS
UNCERTAIN BUT IT APPEARS TO BE JUST SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT AND A BIT
FASTER THAN IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS NOT
CHANGED MUCH.  THE LATEST GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS A 500 MB TROUGH
SOUTHWEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  IF THIS TROUGH IS DEEP ENOUGH...IT COULD PULL THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE MY TRACK.  THIS REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

PROBLEMS PROBLEMS! 06Z SATELLITE LOCATION FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB
CAME IN SOUTH AND EAST OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY POSITION. A 0140Z
TRMM OVERPASS SUGGESTS A MORE NORTHERLY POSITION...BUT IS VERY
AMBIGUOUS ON THE LONGITUDE. THUS...THE INITIAL POSITION IS VERY
UNCERTAIN. WHILE IT IS A BAD IDEA TO RE-LOCATED A PARTLY EXPOSED
CENTER BASED ON INFRARED IMAGERY...AN EXTRAPOLATED POSITION FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY DOES NOT SEEM TO FIT THE CLOUD PATTERN THAT WELL.
THUS...SOME ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY. IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IF
SOME RE-LOCATION IS NECESSARY WHEN VISIBLE IMAGERY BECOMES
AVAILABLE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN...WITH THE BEST ESTIMATE
295/3. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A RIDGE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.
LARGE SCALE MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES THIS RIDGE MAY WEAKEN AS AN
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BUILDS SOUTHWEST FROM CALIFORNIA. INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH...NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE DOES NOT SHOW A SIGNIFICANT
NORTHWARD TURN IN RESPONSE TO THE DEVELOPING TROUGH. INSTEAD...IT
CALLS FOR A NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS. WITH ALL THE
UNCERTAINTIES...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS LITTLE CHANGED FROM THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE...WITH ONLY SOME SOUTHWARD SHIFT FOR THE CURRENT
LOCATION.

ONE POSSIBLE PROBLEM WITH LOCATING THE CENTER IS THAT IT MAY BE
TRYING TO MOVE UNDER THE CONVECTIVE OVERCAST. A STRONG AND
PERSISTENT AREA OF CONVECTION...WITH TOPS TO -80C...IS WEST OR
SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER. THIS SHEAR PATTERN INDICATES THE SYSTEM IS
NEAR TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH. THE SHEAR APPEARS TO BE DECREASING...
AND IF THIS TREND CONTINUES THE SYSTEM WILL LIKELY REACH TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH LATER TODAY. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALL FOR
STRENGTHENING SIMILAR TO THE SHIPS MODEL.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OVERALL CHANGE IN HILARY OVER THE PAST 6 HRS.
THE BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER WHICH STARTED AROUND
02Z HAS PERSISTED ALTHOUGH THE TOPS HAVE WARMED SOMEWHAT OVER THE
LAST HOUR OR SO.  THE MOST RECENT TRMM 85GHZ DATA SHOWED A PARTIAL
EYEWALL.  THE LATEST DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATE FROM TAFB IS 45 KT

HELD AT 50 KT. SOME MODEST STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST...IN LINE WITH
THE SHIPS GUIDANCE...BEFORE THE CYCLONE ENCOUNTERS COOLER WATERS
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB INDICATE THAT HILARY HAS CONTINUED
ON A GENERAL NORTHWESTERLY HEADING...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE
IS 325/6 KT. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWEST
MOTION THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD IN RESPONSE TO THE MID-LEVEL TROUGH

SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON INDICATES THAT THE AREA
OF DISTURBED WEATHER OFF THE MEXICAN COAST NEAR MANZANILLO HAS
BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND IS NOW A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  SATELLITE
CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB AND SABA ARE T2.5 SO THE DEPRESSION IS
VERY CLOSE TO TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST
MODEL SUGGESTS THAT THE DEPRESSION WILL BECOME A TROPICAL STORM
WITHIN 12 HOURS WITH MODEST ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING BEFORE COOLER
WATERS ARE ENCOUNTERED...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE SHIPS
GUIDANCE CLOSELY.

WITH ANY NEWLY-FORMED CIRCULATION THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN...
BUT BASED ON SATELLITE FIXES AND MEXICAN RADAR DATA THE INITIAL
MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 360/3.  ALL MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS AN
IMMEDIATE LEFT TURN KEEPING THE CYCLONE OFF THE MEXICAN COAST.  THE
CURRENT MOTION REQUIRES A TROPICAL STORM WATCH FOR A PORTION OF THE
COAST...AND A WARNING MAY BE REQUIRED IF THE NORTHWESTWARD TURN DOES
NOT MATERIALIZE SOON.

RADAR DATA FROM CUYUTLAN MEXICO CLEARLY REVEAL A TIGHT CENTER WITH
BANDING FEATURES.  THERE IS A CLUSTER OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER AND T-NUMBERS ARE 3.0 AND 2.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE.  BASED ON

TROPICAL STORM IRWIN AT THIS TIME.  THERE IS SOME EASTERLY SHEAR
OVER THE SYSTEM...SO ONLY SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED BEFORE
IRWIN REACHES COOL WATERS IN 48 HOURS OR SO.

IRWIN HAS BEEN MOVING NORTHWARD BETWEEN 5 AND 8 KNOTS TOWARD THE
COAST OF MEXICO DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.  HOWEVER...GLOBAL MODELS
DEVELOP A STRONG RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES AND
NORTHERN MEXICO.  THIS PATTERN WOULD FORCE THE TROPICAL STORM ON A

HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS
INDICATE THAT A CYCLONIC CIRCULATION HAS DEVELOPED IN THE BAY OF
CAMPECHE DURING THE DAY.  THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS POORLY DEFINED AND
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS IN ITS FORMATIVE STAGE...A REFORMATION OF THE
CENTER IS LIKELY.  FLUCTUATIONS IN THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY COULD
OCCUR DURING THE NIGHT.   HOWEVER...THE OVERALL PATTERN IS ORGANIZED
ENOUGH FOR THE SYSTEM TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION AT
THIS TIME.
 
THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY EMBEDDED WITHIN A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT.
HOWEVER...NUMERICAL MODELS FORECAST THE SHEAR TO DECREASE AND BOTH
IR IMAGES AND DATA FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN INDICATE THAT
THE SHEAR IS ALREADY DECREASING.  THIS MAY ALLOW THE DEPRESSION TO
REACH TROPICAL STORM STATUS IS THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.
 
STEERING CURRENTS ARE WEAK AND NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS INDICATED BY
THE GLOBAL MODELS.  MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A GENERAL
SLOW NORTHWEST TO NORTHWARD TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS AS INDICATED IN
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.
 
ALTHOUGH NO SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED...DUE TO
UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FORECAST...INTERESTS IN THE WESTERN GULF OF
MEXICO...COASTAL SECTIONS OF NORTHEASTERN MEXICO AND TEXAS SHOULD
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS DEPRESSION.

AS OFTEN OCCURS IN A CYCLONE AT THIS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT...
CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE HAS SHOWN A SHARP
DIURNAL DECREASE. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB
REMAIN 25 KT...AND THAT REMAINS THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY OF THE
CYCLONE.

LAST LIGHT VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST THE POORLY-DEFINED
CENTER IS A LITTLE SOUTHEAST OF THE PREVIOUS POSITION...AND THE
INITIAL MOTION IS SET TO STATIONARY. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND SURFACE
ANALYSES INDICATE A DEEP LAYER RIDGE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION...AND
AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE TO THE SOUTH. THIS COMBINATION IS
PRODUCING WEAK STEERING CURRENTS. LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THE
RIDGE TO THE NORTH SHOULD SHIFT EASTWARD OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS...ALLOWING THE CYCLONE TO BEGIN A NORTHWESTWARD MOTION WITH A
POSSIBLE NORTHWARD TURN BY 72 HR. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE GENERALLY
AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS...BUT
IS SLOWER THAN THE AVN AND THE VARIOUS BAM MODELS...WHICH HAVE THE
DEPRESSION BETWEEN 27.5N-29.5N BY 72 HR.
 
THE UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE TO THE SOUTH IS CAUSING WESTERLY SHEAR
OVER THE CYCLONE. LARGE-SCALE MODELS AGREE ON PERSISTENCE AND
AMPLIFICATION OF THE RIDGE...BUT DISAGREE ON THE DETAILS OF HOW MUCH
SHEAR WILL OCCUR OVER THE DEPRESSION. IT APPEARS THE BEST CHANCE FOR
THE SYSTEM TO STRENGTHEN WILL BE AFTER 24 HR...DEPENDING ON EXACTLY
WHERE IT IS IN RELATION TO THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS. THUS...THE
INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR STRENGTHENING INTO A TROPICAL STORM BY
36 HR. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE SHIPS MODEL CALLS FOR NO
STRENGTHENING AT ALL DUE TO THE SHEAR.

ALTHOUGH ONLY SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IS CURRENTLY INDICATED...DUE TO
UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FORECAST...INTERESTS IN THE WESTERN GULF OF
MEXICO...COASTAL SECTIONS OF NORTHEASTERN MEXICO AND TEXAS SHOULD
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS DEPRESSION.

THE DEPRESSION REMAINS UNIMPRESSIVE-LOOKING...WITH LITTLE EVIDENCE
OF UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW AND LIMITED DEEP CONVECTION.  WESTERLY
SHEAR CONTINUES TO IMPEDE DEVELOPMENT.  GLOBAL MODELS BUILD
THE UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN GULF DURING THE NEXT FEW
DAYS.  IF THIS OCCURS...THE DEPRESSION SHOULD HAVE A MORE FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT FOR STRENGTHENING.  HOWEVER THE SHIPS MODEL...OUR MOST
SKILLFUL INTENSITY FORECAST TOOL...INDICATES THAT THE SHEAR WILL
REMAIN STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT SIGNIFICANT INTENSIFICATION THROUGH
THE FORECAST PERIOD.    

STEERING CURRENTS ARE WEAK AND THE POORLY-DEFINED CENTER OF THE
DEPRESSION HAS BEEN MEANDERING.  A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE IS
EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS AND THIS SHOULD START TO STEER THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
SLOWLY NORTHWESTWARD.  THE CURRENT NHC TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
PREVIOUS ONES AND ALSO RESEMBLES THE ONE PRODUCED BY THE U.K. MET.
OFFICE GLOBAL MODEL...EXCEPT SLOWER.

EVEN THOUGH THE FORECAST SHOWS ONLY SLIGHT STRENGTHENING...BECAUSE
OF THE UNCERTAINTIES IN INTENSITY PREDICTION...INTERESTS IN THE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT THU JUN 08 2000

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE HAS REMAINED NEARLY STATIONARY FOR THE PAST
12 HOURS WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL CONVECTIVE PATTERN.
UPPER-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR CONTINUES TO INHIBIT ANY SIGNIFICANT
DEVELOPMENT.  THE CURRENT INTENSITY OF 25 KT IS BASED ON SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 1.5 FROM TAFB AND 1.0 FROM SAB...AND
CONTINUITY WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECASTS. AN AIR FORCE RESERVE PLANE
WILL INVESTIGATE THIS SYSTEM LATER TODAY.

THIS SYSTEM REMAINS IN A WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT SO LITTLE MOTION
IS EXPECTED TODAY.  THE DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO BEGIN A SLOW
NORTHWEST DRIFT LATER TODAY WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW AS A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE
SOUTHEAST U.S. MOVES OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND INCREASES THE
SOUTHEASTERLY TO SOUTHERLY STEERING FLOW OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF
MEXICO.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS CONSISTENT WITH THE UKMET
MODEL AND THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECASTS.

ONLY SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION IF FORECAST DUE TO THE VERTICAL SHEAR
IMPINGING ON THE SYSTEM.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SHIPS MODEL
WHICH HOLDS THE INTENSITY NEAR 30 KT THROUGH 72 HOURS.  HOWEVER...
THE AVN AND UKMET MODELS INDICATE A NARROW UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE/HIGH
BUILDING OVER THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION AFTER 48 HOURS. THIS MAY ALLOW
THE DEPRESSION TO REACH TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY BY THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD.
 
DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES IN INTENSITY PREDICTION...INTERESTS IN THE

VISIBLE METEOSAT IMAGERY THIS MORNING SUGGESTS THAT THE STRONG
TROPICAL WAVE IN THE EASTERN ATLANTIC HAS DEVELOPED A CLOSED
CIRCULATION AND THE SYSTEM IS THEREFORE UPGRADED TO TROPICAL
DEPRESSION TWO.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET TO 30 KT BASED ON THE

THE CENTER IS NOT WELL DEFINED BUT THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED
AS 270/15.  ALL GUIDANCE TAKES THE SYSTEM TO THE WEST OR WEST-
NORTHWEST OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE
TO LBAR...A GOOD PERFORMER IN THE DEEP TROPICS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS UNUSUALLY PROBLEMATIC.  THERE HAS NEVER
BEEN MUCH DEEP CONVECTION WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND THE SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES ARE MARGINAL.  NONETHELESS...SHIPS GUIDANCE INDICATES
STRENGTHENING.  THE GFDL...ON THE OTHER HAND...LOSES THE SYSTEM

THE DEPRESSION REMAINS VERY POORLY ORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON...AND
THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE LOW-LEVEL CENTERS.  CONVECTION IS NOT VERY
DEEP AND LIMITED IN AREAL COVERAGE AS WELL.  SATELLITE DVORAK
CLASSIFICATIONS RANGE FROM 25 TO 30 KTS...AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY
REMAINS AT 30 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/14.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN PRETTY GOOD
AGREEMENT ON A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS.  BOTH THE UKMET AND AVN MAINTAIN A STRONG 500 MB HIGH NORTH OF
THE SYSTEM FOR THE DURATION OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST UPDATES THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND IS CLOSE TO THE LBAR
GUIDANCE.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR MODEST STRENGTHENING IN DEFERENCE TO
THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL...OUR BEST GUIDANCE.  SSTS ARE ONLY
MARGINALLY WARM...AND ARE A BIT COOLER IN THE PATH OF THE
DEPRESSION.  ON THE OTHER HAND...THERE IS LITTLE SHEAR OVER THE

...CORRECTED DISCUSSION NUMBER TO 3...
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE DEPRESSION REMAINS POORLY
ORGANIZED WITH ONLY A SMALL AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION TO THE SOUTH OF
THE ESTIMATED CENTER.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE UNCHANGED SO
INITIAL WINDS ARE HELD AT 30 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  ALTHOUGH
VERTICAL SHEAR IS NOT STRONG...THE SYSTEM IS MOVING OVER MARGINAL
SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES.  THE GFDL MODEL...WHICH IS QUITE SENSITIVE
TO SST...DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.  OUR BEST
INTENSITY GUIDANCE...THE SHIPS MODEL...CONTINUES TO INDICATE
STRENGTHENING AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS STRENGTHENING TO A
TROPICAL STORM BY 36 HOURS AS IN THE LAST ADVISORY.  HOWEVER...
CONFIDENCE IN THIS INTENSITY FORECAST IS NOT HIGH.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 275/14.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A
SUBSTANTIAL MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE FOR
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS SHOULD MAINTAIN A WESTWARD TO SLIGHTLY
NORTH OF WESTWARD STEERING CURRENT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BUT NUDGED JUST SLIGHTLY
TO THE RIGHT.  THIS IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL

THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPRESSION HAS BECOME LESS
ORGANIZED AND THERE IS ONLY A WEAK CURVED CONVECTIVE BAND ASSOCIATED
WITH THE SYSTEM.  I AM NOT CERTAIN IF THERE IS A CLOSED CIRCULATION
BUT QUICKSCAT CERTAINLY SHOWS AN OPEN WAVE IN THE LATEST SWATH.   IT
APPEARS THAT COOL WATER AND CLIMATOLOGY ARE THE NEGATIVE FACTORS FOR
STRENGTHENING SINCE WIND SHEAR IS LOW.  SHIPS MODEL LIKES THE SYSTEM
AND BRINGS IT TO 50 TO 55 KNOTS BETWEEN 60 AND 72 HOURS.  BY THEN...
THE DEPRESSION WOULD BE OVER 27 DEGREE WATER AND ONLY 9 KNOTS OF
WIND SHEAR AS INDICATED BY SHIPS MODEL.  ON THE OTHER HAND...MOST OF
THE GLOBAL MODELS...IN THE SHORT TERM...SHOW A GRADUAL WEAKENING OF
THE DEPRESSION.  IN FACT.. BOTH GFDL AND UK MODELS DISSIPATE THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE WITHIN TWO DAYS.

DUE TO CONTINUITY...WE ARE KEEPING THE SYSTEM AS A DEPRESSION AT
THIS TIME BUT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF WE HAVE TO DECLARE IT A
TROPICAL WAVE LATER TODAY AND DISCONTINUE THE ADVISORIES. FOR
NOW...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS THE DEPRESSION AT 30 KNOTS AND IN
CASE IT SURVIVES...IT BRINGS THE WINDS TO 35 KNOTS AS IT APPROACHES
THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.  

A STRONGER THAN NORMAL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE ATLANTIC HAS
FORCED THE DEPRESSION TO MOVE ON A TRACK SOUTH OF DUE WEST AT ABOUT
18 KNOTS. BECAUSE THE RIDGE IS FORECAST TO PERSIST...A GENERAL
WESTWARD TRACK IS ANTICIPATED THROUGH 48 HOURS.  A TURN MORE THE
WEST-NORTHWEST IS LIKELY THEREAFTER.  MOST OF THE MODELS KEEP THE
DEPRESSION ON THIS GENERAL TRACK.

DEPRESSION THREE BASED ON A 0657Z TRMM OVERPASS AND A DELAYED 0600Z
SHIP REPORT OF OF 45 KT AND 1007.8 MB JUST EAST OF THE SYSTEM
CENTER.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 280/16. THE STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH
OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION THREE SHOULD KEEP THE SYSTEM ON A GENERAL
WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. SOME WEAK
EASTERLY SHEAR SHOULD ALSO KEEP MOST OF THE CONVECTION IN THE
WESTERN SEMICIRCLE WHICH WILL ALSO HELP TO MAINTAIN A GENERAL
WESTERLY TRACK. WE HAVE FOLLOWED MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE THROUGH
36 HOURS AND THEN FOLLOWED MORE CLOSELY THE 00Z UKMET RUN IN BENDING
THE FORECAST TRACK A LITTLE MORE DUE WEST AFTER 48 HOURS.
 
THE OVERNIGHT BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION APPEARS TO HAVE SPUN UP A
TIGHT WIND FIELD NEAR THE SYSTEM CENTER BASED ON THE REPORT FROM
SHIP MZYF3 JUST EAST OF THE SYSTEM CENTER. HOWEVER...WE ARE KEEPING
THE INITIAL INTENSITY JUST BELOW TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH BASED ON
THE RECENT DOWNWARD TREND IN THE CENTRAL DEEP CONVECTION. OUTFLOW IS
FAIR TO GOOD IN THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE AND SLIGHTLY RESTRICTED
ELSEWHERE. THE OVERALL UPPER AIR PATTERN FAVORS STEADY STRENGTHENING
AS LONG AS THE SYSTEM REMAINS OVER WARM SSTS. 25C SST WATER LIES
JUST N OF 14N LATITUDE WHICH SHOULD ACT TO SLOW THE INTENSIFICATION
PROCESS AFTER 48 HOURS. THE SHIPS MODEL BRINGS TROPICAL DEPRESSION
THREE TO MINIMAL HURRICANE INTENSITY IN 72 HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL

TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO DISCUSSION NUMBER   2
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 AM EST FRI AUG 04 2000
 
METEOSAT SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN
ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPRESSION HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER
ORGANIZED.  IT HAS A WELL DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION WITH
EXCELLENT BANDING FEATURES AND BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT EASTERLY
SHEAR...MOST OF THE OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED TO THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.
T-NUMBERS FROM SAB AND TAFB ARE BOTH 2.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE. ON
THIS BASIS...THE DEPRESSION IS BEING UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM
ALBERTO AT THIS TIME. 

ALBERTO IS EMBEDDED WITHIN A DEEP LAYER OF EASTERLY FLOW AND THE
SHEAR IS FORECAST TO DECREASE.  THE ONLY APPARENT NEGATIVE FACTOR
FOR SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING IS THE MARGINAL...25-26 DEGREE CELSIUS
OCEAN TEMPERATURE AHEAD OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THE OVERALL
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS SUGGEST THAT ALBERTO COULD BECOME A
HURRICANE IN ABOUT 2 DAYS OR SO AS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.  SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL BRINGS ALBERTO TO 71 KNOTS
BY 72 HOURS.

A CURRENT WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST OF
ALBERTO COULD INDUCE A TRACK MORE TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST.  HOWEVER...
MOST OF THE LONG RANGE GLOBAL MODELS BUILD THE RIDGE OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC.  IF ALBERTO MISSES THE WEAKNESS...IT MAY CONTINUE
ON A GENERAL WEST OR WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF
THE HIGH FOR A FEW MORE DAYS.  GLOBAL MODELS WILL PROBABLY HAVE A
BETTER HANDLING OF THE STORM IN THE TODAY 12 UTC RUN.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT ALBERTO CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER
ORGANIZED.  IT HAS A WELL DEFINED CLOUD BAND WRAPPING AROUND THE
CENTER AND THERE ARE SOME INDICATIONS OF A BANDING-TYPE EYE TRYING
TO FORM.  SHIP V2PA9 REPORTED 35 KNOTS...1005 MB PRESSURE AND HEAVY
RAIN ABOUT 60 N MI NORTH OF THE CENTER.  WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 50
KNOTS AT THIS TIME.   THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN
BECAUSE MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS INCLUDING THE GFDL AND WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THE AVN...WEAKEN OR DISSIPATE ALBERTO.  HOWEVER...SHIPS
AND THE MIT EXPERIMENTAL INTENSITY FORECAST MODELS BRING ALBERTO TO
75 AND 95 KNOTS RESPECTIVELY.  AT THIS TIME THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
GOES ALONG WITH THE INTENSIFICATION TREND SINCE THE SHEAR IS
EXPECTED TO BE LOW.  BUT...I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE FORECAST
HAS TO BE REVERSED TO A WEAKENING TREND OR STEADY STATE AS INDICATED
BY SOME GLOBAL MODELS.
 
THE CENTER OF ALBERTO HAS BECOME BETTER DEFINED...AND IT HAS BEEN
LOCATED A LITTLE TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS POSITION. IT DOES NOT
MEAN THAT THE STORM HAS MOVED NORTHWARD.   THE OVERALL MOTION IS
ABOUT 275/15.  ALBERTO IS EMBEDDED WITHIN AN EASTERLY FLOW...SOUTH
OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WHICH IS FORECAST TO PERSIST.  THE STRENGTH
OF THE RIDGE VARIES IN THE DIFFERENT GLOBAL MODELS BUT IS EXPECTED
TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP ALBERTO ON A GENERAL WEST-TO WEST
NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS IS ALSO THE CONSENSUS OF THE
TRACK MODELS.  THE SOUTHERNMOST TRACK IS THE GFDL RUN USING THE UK
MODEL FIELDS.

...CORRECTED FOR INITIAL MAXIMUM WINDS...

ALBERTO HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN ORGANIZATION DURING THE EVENING. 
WHILE THE EYE-LIKE FEATURE SEEN EARLIER HAS DISAPPEARED...CONVECTION
REMAINS STRONG NEAR THE CIRCULATION CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...AFWA...AND SAB ARE 45 KT...45 KT...AND 35 KT
RESPECTIVELY...SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL STAY AT 50 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14...A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS
TRACK.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND LARGE SCALE MODELS INDICATE A STRONG
LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE STORM...WHICH SHOULD PERSIST
THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS SHOULD MOVE ALBERTO ALONG A WEST
TO WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK.  NHC TRACK GUIDANCE AGREES WELL WITH THIS
SCENARIO...WITH THE ONLY DISAGREEMENT BEING HOW FAST THE STORM WILL
MOVE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...
BUT ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH DUE TO THE INITIAL MOTION.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS MORE IFFY.  WHILE UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE
CURRENTLY FAVORABLE...THE MORE NORTHWARD TRACK TAKES THE STORM OVER
SLIGHTLY COOLER WATER.  THIS MIGHT SLOW INTENSIFICATION.  THE SHIPS
MODEL CONTINUES TO CALL FOR ALBERTO BECOME A HURRICANE IN 24 HR...
WHILE THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM IN 40 HR.  THE GFDN CALLS FOR
LITTLE STRENGTHENING.  COMPLICATING MATTERS FURTHER IS AN UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH THE AVN FORECASTS TO DEVELOP NEAR ALBERTO BY 72 HR. 
THIS WOULD CREATE UNFAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL WINDS.  SINCE OTHER LARGE-
SCALE MODELS SHOW LESS DEVELOPMENT TO THE TROUGH...IT WILL NOT YET
FACTOR INTO THE FORECAST.  AS THE CENTRAL CONVECTION IS STILL
STRONG...THE INTENSITY FORECAST REMAINS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  HOWEVER...GIVEN THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVES...ALBERTO COULD
STRENGTHEN SLOWER THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.

TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO DISCUSSION NUMBER   5
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST SAT AUG 05 2000

TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE PAST 6
HOURS WITH A SMALL CDO FEATURE DEVELOPING OVER THE SYSTEM CENTER.
BASED ON THE CDO AND 0600Z SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 50 KT
FROM TAFB AND SAB...THE INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN INCREASED TO 55
KT. OUTFLOW HAS IMPROVED TO THE NORTH AND THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN
HAS BECOME MORE CIRCULAR.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 285/13. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MINOR FLUCTUATIONS IN
THE STORM MOTION THE PAST 6 TO 12 HOURS DUE TO RE-ORGANIZATION OF
THE CENTRAL DEEP CONVECTION. HOWEVER...WITH SUCH A STRONG
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ALBERTO...A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST
OR WEST TRACK IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE 00Z UKMET RUN IS
SOMEWHAT CONFUSING WITH THE VORTEX TRACKER INDICATING A 72-HOUR
POSITION NEAR 18N 48W...WHILE THE SURFACE TO 850 MB FIELDS SHOW THE
CENTER OF ALBERTO CLOSER TO 15N 44W. WE LIKE THE OVERALL SYNOPTIC
PATTERN OF THE UKMET AND THE SPEED OF THE VORTEX TRACKER...BUT NOT
THE POSITIONS. THE PREVIOUS 2 MODEL OUTPUTS WERE CLOSER TO 16N 45W
AND WE HAVE FOLLOWED THAT TREND. THE GFDL HAS HAD A SHARP RIGHT OF
TRACK BIAS THE PAST 24 HOURS...SO I HAVE PLACED LITTLE FAITH IN THAT
MODEL. THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AND BETWEEN
THE UKMET AND GFDN VORTEX TRACKER POSITIONS. WE HAVE ALSO MADE A
MORE WESTWARD BEND IN THE TRACK AFTER 48 HOURS BASED ON A POSSIBLE
200 MB CONFLUENT ZONE SETTING UP BETWEEN WEAK NORTHWEST TO WESTERLY
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW AHEAD OF A DEEPENING TROUGH AND THE POLEWARD
OUTFLOW OF ALBERTO...WHICH SHOULD ACT TO RE-INFORCE THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE AXIS TO THE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM.
 
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST OR PHILOSOPHY.
ALBERTO IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY MOVE OVER SLIGHTLY COOLER WATER
AFTER 12 HOURS. SINCE ALBERTO IS ALSO A RATHER SMALL TROPICAL
CYCLONE...SMALL CHANGES IN THE CENTRAL DEEP CONVECTION CAN RESULT IN
SIGNIFICANT SHORT TERM INTENSIFICATION. FROM 36 TO 48 HOURS...ALL
THE GLOBAL MODELS AGREE ON DIGGING A 200 MB TROUGH TO THE NORTHWEST
OF THE SYSTEM...WHICH SHOULD AID THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLEWARD
OUTFLOW AND ENHANCE THE INTENSIFICATION PROCESS.

GLOBAL MODELS...PRIMARILY THE MRF...DID NOT FORECAST STRENGTHENING
AND INDEED ALBERTO IS WEAKER THAN YESTERDAY.  THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS
BECOME LESS ORGANIZED...THE EXCELLENT BANDING FEATURES ARE NO
LONGER OBSERVED AND THE OUTFLOW IS NOT WELL DEFINED. IT APPEARS THAT
THE UNEXPECTED WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION DURING THE PAST 12 HOURS
BROUGHT ALBERTO TO RELATIVELY COOLER WATERS.  HOWEVER...ALBERTO
STILL HAS A WELL DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION AND DEEP CONVECTION
NEAR THE CENTER.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS LOWERED TO 50 KNOTS AT THIS
TIME.  SHIPS INTENSITY AS WELL AS THE MIT EXPERIMENTAL FORECAST
MODELS INSIST ON STRENGTHENING WHILE THE 06 UTC GFDL RUN MAINTAINS
THE STORM THROUGH 72 HOURS.  BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT WEAKENING TREND
AND THE MARGINAL SST ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST KEEPS ALBERTO AT 50 KNOTS WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN
INTENSITY BEYOND 48 HOURS WHEN ALBERTO APPROACHES WARMER WATERS. 
THIS FORECAST IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.

ALBERTO IS STILL MOVING 285/13 BUT ACCORDING TO THE GLOBAL MODELS...
THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ALBERTO IS FORECAST TO BUILD. CONSEQUENTLY
...A TURN MORE TO THE WEST SHOULD BEGIN IN A DAY OR SO WITH A SLIGHT
INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED. THIS IS ALSO THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY THE
GFDL...THE UK AND THE MRFX MODELS.

IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY THAT THE INTENSITY
FORECAST WAS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND INDEED THE FORECAST WAS INCORRECT.
ALBERTO WAS WEAKENING EARLIER TODAY BUT IT NOW HAS DEVELOPED AN EYE.
DATA T-NUMBERS ARE 4.0 BUT DUE TO DVORAK CONSTRAINS...THE CI NUMBERS
ARE BEING HELD AT 3.5 AT THIS TIME.  THE OUTFLOW HAS NOT IMPROVED
BUT A RING OF DEEP CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED AROUND THE EYE-FEATURE.
PLENTY OF CLOUD BANDS ARE BEGINNING TO WRAP AROUND ALBERTO ON THE
EAST SIDE AND AN IRREGULAR CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST IS FORMING. 
MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE EYE FEATURE...WHICH HAS PERSISTED FOR A FEW
HOURS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN INCREASED TO 65 KNOTS.  
ALBERTO IS THUS BEING UPGRADED TO HURRICANE STATUS AT THIS TIME. THE
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 65 KNOTS UNTIL ALBERTO MOVES OVER WARMER
WATERS BEYOND 48 HOURS.   SHIPS MODEL SUGGEST THAT SHEAR IS NOT A
PROBLEM FOR STRENGTHENING...ONLY THE SST COULD INHIBIT THE
DEVELOPMENT DURING THE FIRST 48 HOURS.
 
ALBERTO IS MOVING 280/13 BUT ACCORDING TO THE GLOBAL MODELS...
THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ALBERTO IS FORECAST TO BUILD.  IF ALBERTO
INCREASES IN FORWARD SPEED...IT MAY MISS THE CURRENT WEAKNESS OF THE
RIDGE AND IT WOULD THEN BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE BUILDING
RIDGE.  THIS COULD RESULT IN TRACK A LITTLE MORE TO THE WEST AS
INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THIS IS ALSO THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY THE GFDL...THE
UK...THE MRFX MODELS AND BY THE 12 UTC AVN WHICH SHOWS A VORTMAX
RAPIDLY MOVING WESTWARD DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS.

CENTRAL DEEP CONVECTION HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE PAST
6 HOURS AND THE OUTFLOW PATTERN ALSO HAS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE IN ALL
QUADRANTS. DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB
ARE BOTH 4.0...65 TO 70 KT. ALSO...AN EYEWALL CONVECTIVE BURST...
-80C TO -82C TOPS...HAS PERSISTED FOR ALMOST 3 HOURS IN THE EAST
SEMICIRCLE. THEREFORE THE INTENSITY HAS BEEN INCREASED TO 70 KT.

INITIAL MOTION IS 270/15. BASED ON THE MORE WESTWARD TRACK OVER THE
PAST 12 HOURS...THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK AND IS ALONG THE EXTREME SOUTHERN PORTION OF
THE FORECAST MODELS ENVELOPE. THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH HAS
SHOWN NO SIGNS OF WEAKENING AND THE UKMET AND AVIATION MODELS HAVE
NOT PICKED UP ON THIS...WHILE MAINTAINING A PERSISTENT RIGHT OF
TRACK BIAS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR FORECAST MODELS ARE CONSISTENT IN
TRACKING ALBERTO ON A GENERAL WEST OR WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH
36 TO 48 HOURS. AFTER THAT...THERE IS DIVERGENCE AMONG THE MODELS...
BUT THEY GENERALLY AGREE IN TAKING THE HURRICANE MORE TOWARD THE
NORTHWEST. HOWEVER...NONE OF THE MODELS BRING THE 300-200 MB TROUGH
SOUTH OF 18N LATITUDE...WHILE MAINTAINING THE 500 MB RIDGE AXIS TO
THE NORTH. AS A RESULT...WE HAVE ONLY PUT A SMALL STAIR-STEP IN THE
FORECAST TRACK IN 36 TO 48 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL TURN BACK TO THE
WEST BY 72 HOURS SINCE THE SYSTEM WILL BE EXPERIENCING NORTHERLY
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BY 48 HOURS.

ONLY SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD
AS A RESULT OF ALBERTO TRACKING OVER COOLER SSTS. WARM MOIST
UNSTABLE SOUTHERLY INFLOW AT THE TOP OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER HAS BEEN
HELPING TO GENERATE STRONG CONVECTION...DESPITE THE COOL SSTS...AND
THIS MAY CONTINUE ON AND OFF FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS. HOWEVER...THE
COOL STABLE NEAR-SURFACE LAYER WILL LIKELY PREVENT THE FULL EFFECT
OF THE STRONGEST WINDS FROM REACHING THE SURFACE UNTIL THE SYSTEM
MOVES OVER WARMER WATER.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT SUN AUG 06 2000
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/12...ANOTHER NUDGE TOWARD THE RIGHT. 
MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES SUGGESTING A NORTHWESTWARD TURN BEYOND
36-48 HOURS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A MAJOR TROUGH
DIGGING SOUTHWARD AHEAD OF ALBERTO...AND LOOKS LIKE SOME OF OUTFLOW
IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT OF SYSTEM IS BEING PULLED NORTHWARD AHEAD
OF THE TROUGH.  THE GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT A PORTION OF THIS
TROUGH WILL HANG BACK ENOUGH TO DEFLECT THE CYCLONE TO THE NORTH
TOWARDS THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST HAS
BEEN ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
SATELLITE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN A CONSENSUS 77 KT...AND
THE INTENSITY REMAINS AT 75 KT WITH THIS PACKAGE.  A MORE
NORTHWARD TRACK WILL LIMIT ACCESS TO WARM WATER AND INCREASE THE
SHEAR.  THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO REMAIN INVARIANT IN INTENSITY
DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.

HURRICANE ALBERTO DISCUSSION NUMBER  13
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM AST MON AUG 07 2000
 
ALBERTO HAS INTENSIFIED SLIGHTLY DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS BASED ON
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 75 TO 85 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB...AND
OBJECTIVE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 80 TO 85 KT. THEREFORE...THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 80 KT. OUTFLOW REMAINS GOOD IN ALL
QUADRANTS AND A WELL-DEFINED POLEWARD OUTFLOW CHANNEL HAS DEVELOPED.

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/13. ALBERTO HAS MADE ITS NIGHTLY WESTWARD
WOBBLE AGAIN AND THE MOTION OVER THE PAST 9 HOURS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN
CLOSE TO 270 DEGREES. HOWEVER...THE TREND OVER THE PAST 36 HOURS HAS
BEEN CLOSE TO 285 DEGREES. ALBERTO IS EXPECTED TO STAY ON A GENERAL
WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD. THE NEW 00Z UKMET
MODEL TAKES ALBERTO SHARPLY OFF TO THE NORTHWEST. HOWEVER...THE
CURRENT POSITION IS AT LEAST 60 NM SOUTH OF THE UKMET 12Z FORECAST
POSITION SO WE HAVE PLACED LITTLE WEIGHT ON THE UKMET SCENARIO.
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DIVERGENCE AMONG THE FORECAST MODELS AFTER 24
HOURS WITH SOME TAKING ALBERTO DUE NORTH. IT APPEARS THAT THE GLOBAL
MODELS ARE PLACING TOO MUCH STEERING EMPHASIS ON THE UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH TO THE NORTHWEST...WHICH ONLY APPEARS TO BE ENHANCING THE
OUTFLOW AT THIS TIME. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A LITTLE TO THE LEFT
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...AND CLOSE TO CLIPER AND THE 00Z NOGAPS
MODEL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH MAY BYPASS ALBERTO
TO THE NORTH...WHICH COULD POSSIBLY RESULT IN A MORE WESTWARD TRACK
THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS INDICATING AFTER 48 HOURS.

THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH NORTHWEST OF ALBERTO HAS
HELPED CREATE A POLEWARD OUTFLOW CHANNEL. BUOYS LOCATED JUST WEST OF
ALBERTO INDICATE THE HURRICANE IS NOW MOVING OVER WARMER...26C...
SSTS AND SOME SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION IS STILL POSSIBLE UNTIL ALBERTO
ENCOUNTERS SOME NORTHWESTERLY SHEAR AFTER 36 HOURS. THE SHIPS
INTENSITY MODEL ACTUALLY TAKES ALBERTO DOWN FROM THE CURRENT 80 KT
TO 70 KT IN 36 HOURS...DESPITE MOVING OVER WARMER WATER AND LITTLE
CHANGE IN THE VERTICAL SHEAR WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE EXCESSIVE.
HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES SOME DRY AIR BEGINNING TO
WRAP INTO THE SYSTEM FROM THE SOUTHWEST WHICH MAY INHIBIT ANY
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT FOR AWHILE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON AUG 07 2000
 
ALBERTO HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVER THE PAST SIX HOURS...WITH JUST THE
FAINTEST HINT OF AN EYE IN THE CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST AND GOOD
CIRRUS OUTFLOW OVER THE NORTH SEMICIRCLE.  SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE ALL 77 KT...SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 80 KT FOR
THIS PACKAGE.

ALBERTO HAS WOBBLED A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS AND
THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 280/13.  THE TRACK FORECAST SCENARIO IS
RATHER COMPLEX.  WHILE THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF ALBERTO REMAINS
STRONG...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
DEVELOPING WEST OF THE HURRICANE.  THIS IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE AT
LEAST SOME NORTHWARD MOTION.  NHC TRACK GUIDANCE IS SPLIT INTO TWO
CAMPS.  THE FIRST...WHICH INCLUDES THE CLIPER...BAMS...BAMM...AND
NHC90...CALLS FOR A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION FOR 24-36 HR FOLLOWED BY A
NORTHWESTWARD TURN.  THE SECOND...WHICH INCLUDES THE BAMD...GFDL...
GFDN...GFDU...UKMET...LBAR...AND VICBAR...CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE
NORTHWEST MOTION...WITH VICBAR EVEN SHOWING A NORTHWARD MOTION AFTER
48 HR.  THE SECOND CAMP HAS THE MODELS THAT ARE GENERALLY MORE
RELIABLE...WHILE THE FIRST CAMP IS CLOSER TO WHAT ALBERTO IS DOING
NOW.  THE TRACK FORECAST WILL FOLLOW THE FIRST CAMP AND WILL BE VERY
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  

THE CLOUD PATTERN OF ALBERTO HAS BECOME ELONGATED SOUTHWEST-
NORTHEAST...SUGGESTING THE TROUGH IS INFLUENCING THE STORM.  LARGE-
SCALE MODELS HAVE DIFFERING EVOLUTIONS OF THE TROUGH...WITH THE AVN
SPLITTING IT IN TWO WITH ALBERTO IN BETWEEN...THE UKMET DEVELOPING A
RATHER LARGE COLD LOW NEAR THE FORECAST TRACK...AND THE NOGAPS
DEVELOPING A WEAKER BUT PERSISTENT TROUGH IN THE HURRICANE'S PATH. 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS THE AVN OR UKMET SOLUTIONS ARE
BETTER...BUT DOES NOT CONCLUSIVELY SHOW WHICH OF THOSE TWO MODELS
MAY BE RIGHT.  IF THE AVN VERIFIES...CONDITIONS WOULD BE QUITE
FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING AFTER 48 HR OF LESS FAVORABLE SHEARING
CONDITIONS.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL CALL FOR LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD...BUT IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING
IF ALBERTO WEAKENED SOMEWHAT AND THEN RE-INTENSIFIED.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM AST MON AUG 07 2000
 
THE CLOUD PATTERN OF ALBERTO HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT RAGGED THIS
AFTERNOON AS THE HURRICANE IS SHOWING SIGNS OF SHEAR.  HOWEVER...THE
CENTRAL CONVECTION REMAINS STRONG AND THE SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES REMAIN 77 KT.  THUS...THE MAXIMUM WINDS REMAIN 80 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/12.  THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE
SYNOPTIC PATTERN FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...WITH THE LOW/MID LEVEL
RIDGE TO THE NORTH AND THE MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TO THE WEST.  NHC
TRACK GUIDANCE STILL SHOWS SOME SPREAD BETWEEN A WEST-NORTHWEST
MOTION AND AN ALMOST NORTH MOTION (VICBAR).  HOWEVER...THE UKMET AND
BAMD MODELS HAVE SHIFTED WESTWARD FROM THEIR PREVIOUS FORECASTS AND
ARE IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD GUIDANCE. 
THE FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IN BEST
AGREE WITH THE BAMM.

AN SSM/I OVERPASS THIS MORNING DID NOT SHOW AN EYE...AND THE CLOUD
PATTERN REMAINS ELONGATED SOUTHWEST-NORTHEAST.  IT THUS APPEARS THAT
THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH HAS ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  WHILE THERE IS
DISAGREEMENT ON DETAILS...LARGE-SCALE MODELS AGREE THE STORM WILL
ENTER A MORE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT AFTER 48 HR IF IT FOLLOWS THE
FORECAST TRACK.  THUS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR SLIGHT
STRENGTHENING AT 72 HR.  IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE GFDN SHOWS RAPID
INTENSIFICATION TO OVER 100 KT AFTER 48 HR.  THERE REMAINS A
POSSIBILITY THAT ALBERTO COULD WEAKEN SOMEWHAT OVER THE NEXT 48 HR
AS INDICATED BY THE SHIPS MODEL.

THERE ARE INDICATIONS TONIGHT...FROM AN SSMI PASS COURTESY OF THE
NRL WEB SITE...AS WELL AS FROM SATELLITE IMAGERY...THAT ALBERTO IS
EXPERIENCING ENOUGH SHEAR TO BEGIN TO EXPOSE THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION CENTER.  SATELLITE DVORAK T NUMBERS GIVE 77 AND 55 KT...
WHICH DIFFER BY SUCH A LARGE MARGIN DUE TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE
LOCATION OF THE CENTER.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS LOWERED TO 75 KT
WITH THIS ADVISORY...AND IF THE SHEARING IS CONFIRMED WITH VISIBLE
IMAGERY IN THE MORNING...THE INTENSITY MAY NEED TO BE LOWERED
SIGNIFICANTLY AT THAT TIME.  I AM CONVINCED ENOUGH OF THIS TO
FORECAST WEAKENING FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  SUBSEQUENTLY...THE SHEAR
SHOULD LESSEN AND ALBERTO WILL BE IN A MORE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT
AND WOULD LIKELY REINTENSIFY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/11...ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE...BUT WITH
LESS CERTAINTY.  THE SYNOPTIC TRACK REASONING IS COMPLICATED BY THE
POSSIBILITY OF THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER RACING OUT AHEAD OF THE
CONVECTION.  IF THIS OCCURS...THEN THE ACTUAL TRACK IS LIKELY TO BE
TO THE LEFT OF THE FORECAST.  EVEN SO...THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH OF A
WEAKNESS IN THE MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE TO KEEP ALBERTO NORTH OF THE
ISLANDS.

ALBERTO HAS UNDERGONE SOUTHWESTERLY AND NOW SOUTHERLY SHEAR
OVERNIGHT WHICH HAS RESULTED IN SLIGHT WEAKENING AND THE CURRENT
INTENSITY IS DECREASED TO 70 KT. HOWEVER...THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW
REMAINS GOOD IN THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE.

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/13 OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS. HOWEVER...THE
MOTION IS CLOSER TO 275 DEGREES THE PAST 6 HOURS. ALBERTO HAS SHOWN
NO SIGNS OF BEING DEFLECTED POLEWARD BY THE LARGE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH
SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...OR AS ADVERTISED BY MOST OF THE GLOBAL
MODELS. THE CURRENT POSITION IS MORE THAN 30 NM SOUTH OF THE UKMET
12Z POSITION AND AT LEAST 60 NM SOUTH OF THE FSU SUPERENSEMBLE 12Z
MODEL POSITION. THE 00Z AVIATION AND UKMET MODEL RUNS BUILD A 594 DM
500 MB HEIGHT CENTER DUE NORTH OF ALBERTO IN 24 HOURS WHICH SHOULD
PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY SIGNIFICANT POLEWARD MOTION. THE UW-
CIMMS WATER VAPOR WIND ANALYSES ALSO SHOW A LONG NORTHEAST OR EAST-
NORTHEAST FETCH OF 20 TO 30 KT WINDS FROM 850 TO 400 MB NORTH OF
ALBERTO. IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH HAS
BYPASSED ALBERTO...AND WE NOW FEEL THAT THE HURRICANE WILL STAY ON A
MORE WEST-NORTHWEST OR WESTERLY TRACK. WE ARE CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST THROUGH 36 HOURS AND THEN TRACK ALBERTO OFF MORE WESTERLY
AFTERWARDS...WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACKS. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE PAST 48 HOURS OF NOGAPS MODEL RUNS
WHICH HAVE HANDLED THE TRACK DIRECTION QUITE WELL...ALBEIT TOO SLOW.

IF ALBERTO SURVIVES THE SHEAR OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS...THEN STEADY
INTENSIFICATION SHOULD RESUME AFTER THE CYCLONE PASSES WEST OF 50W
LONGITUDE WHERE IT WILL BE MOVING OVER 27C AND WARMER SSTS. IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT OUR INTENSITY FORECAST WILL BE TOO LOW AFTER 36 HOURS
WHEN ALBERTO WILL BE IN 200 MB SADDLE POINT...WHICH WOULD INDICATE
LOW/NO SHEAR AND FAVOR RAPID INTENSIFICATION.

VERTICAL SHEAR.  HOWEVER...THE CENTRAL CONVECTION HAS INCREASED
SOMEWHAT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
ARE UNCHANGED FROM 6 HR AGO.  THE MAXIMUM WINDS WILL REMAIN 70 KT

WHILE A STRONG LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE CONTINUES NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.

THIS FORECAST COULD VERIFY.  THE GFDU AND SHIP MODELS RESPOND TO THE

THE CENTER OF ALBERTO HAS JUMPED NORTHWARD THIS AFTERNOON.  IT IS
NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER THIS IS A REFORMATION OF THE CENTER DUE TO
INTERACTION WITH AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH...OR THE BEGINNING OF THE
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FORECAST BY THE MODELS.  WHATEVER THE
CAUSE...THE HURRICANE HAS LOST ORGANIZATION IN THE PROCESS.  THE
MAXIMUM WINDS ARE DECREASED TO 65 KT...WHICH AGREES WITH THE
SATELLITE ESTIMATES.

WHILE THE NET MOTION OVER THE PAST 12 HR IS 320/11...THE INITIAL
MOTION REMAINS 285/11 DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OVER WHETHER THIS IS
ACTUALLY A TURN.  CONVENTIONAL AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOW STRONG
LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGING NORTH OF ALBERTO...WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE STORM
ON A WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING.  NHC TRACK GUIDANCE STILL UNANIMOUSLY
CALLS FOR A NORTHWEST MOTION.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED
NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST BASED MAINLY ON THE INITIAL POSITION.
IF ALBERTO IS REALLY TURNING NORTHWEST...THE FORECAST TRACK WILL
LIKELY BE SHIFTED FURTHER TO THE RIGHT.
 
THERE IS ENOUGH SOUTHERLY SHEAR AND THE CONVECTION IS NOW
DISORGANIZED ENOUGH THAT ALBERTO IS LIKELY TO WEAKEN TO A TROPICAL
STORM IN THE NEXT 12 HR.  AFTER 24 HR...LARGE-SCALE MODELS CONTINUE
IN UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT THAT THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL SPLIT BY 48
HR AND LEAVE ALBERTO IN A MORE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.  CIRRUS
OUTFLOW FROM THE HURRICANE IS IMPROVING OVER THE WEST SEMICIRCLE...
SUGGESTING THIS PROCESS MAY ALREADY BE STARTING.  THUS...ALBERTO IS

THE JOG TO THE NORTHWEST EARLIER TODAY NOW LOOKS LIKE A TRUE MOTION
AS ALBERTO HAS CONTINUED ON A TRACK OF 325/12 THIS EVENING.  THUS IT
APPEARS THAT THE TURN FORECAST BY NEARLY ALL THE GUIDANCE IS NOW
STARTING TO VERIFY.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS TIGHTLY CLUSTERED AND
INDICATES A GENERAL NORTHWESTERLY MOTION OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. 
WITH THE NORTHWESTERLY MOTION WELL ESTABLISHED...AND AS ANTICIPATED
IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED
TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  WITH A MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE NORTH OF ALBERTO...ANOTHER TEMPORARY TURN TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING EARLY IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

THE SATELLITE PRESENTATION OF ALBERTO IS LESS IMPRESSIVE THAN
EARLIER AND THE WEAKENING TREND CONTINUES.  DVORAK T NUMBERS ARE
DOWN TO 45-55 KT AND SO THE INTENSITY IS LOWERED BELOW HURRICANE
STRENGTH.  THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD BECOME SOMEWHAT MORE FAVORABLE FOR
DEVELOPMENT IN ANOTHER 24 HOURS OR SO AND SO SOME REINTENSIFICATION

IR SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW A CLOUD PATTERN PARTIALLY
DISRUPTED BY SOUTHEASTERLY SHEAR...LIMITED DEEP CONVECTION AND MOST
OF THE OUTFLOW TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT
60 KNOTS AND BECAUSE WATER VAPOR IMAGES SUGGEST THAT ALBERTO
CONTINUES WITHIN A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT...SOME ADDITIONAL WEAKENING
IS POSSIBLE DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.  HOWEVER...AN UPPER-
LOW...CURRENTLY NEAR ALBERTO IS FORECAST BY THE GLOBAL MODELS TO
MOVE TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST AWAY FORM THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  IF
ALBERTO SURVIVES...AND MOST LIKELY IT WILL...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
WILL THEN BE OVER WARMER WATERS AND WITHIN AN UPPER-LEVEL
ENVIRONMENT MORE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING.  IN FACT...THE GFDL
AND THE GFDN MODELS LOWER THE PRESSURE TO AROUND 960 AND 940 MB
RESPECTIVELY WHILE SHIPS BRINGS ALBERTO TO 79 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS. 
THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR 75 KNOTS BY THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD.   

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE...BUT THE BEST
ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 320/12.  THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE
TO THE NORTH OF ALBERTO IS FORECAST TO GRADUALLY SHIFT EASTWARD AS A
NEW TROUGH DEVELOPS ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES.  THIS
PATTERN FAVORS A NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD IN
AGREEMENT WITH GUIDANCE. ON THIS TRACK ALBERTO WILL CONTINUE OVER

CENTRAL CONVECTION.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 65 KT...65
KT...AND 55 KT FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA.  BASED ON THIS THE
MAXIMUM WINDS REMAIN 60 KT. 

THE STORM SEEMS TO BE MOVING A LITTLE FASTER AND THE INITIAL MOTION
IS 315/15.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND LARGE SCALE-MODELS INDICATE A
DEVELOPING MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND AN
UPPER LEVEL LOW SOUTHWEST OF ALBERTO.  THE MODELS INDICATE THE
TROUGH WILL INTENSIFY AND WEAKEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE CURRENTLY
NORTH OF ALBERTO.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW THE STORM TO TURN NORTH WITH
TIME.  ALL NHC TRACK GUIDANCE IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO...
AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS IT.

THE OUTFLOW IS STILL RESTRICTED TO THE SOUTH.  HOWEVER...THE
INCREASE IN CENTRAL CONVECTION SUGGESTS THE SHEAR IS WEAKENING.  AS
ALBERTO MOVES AWAY FROM THE UPPER LEVEL LOW...CONDITIONS SHOULD
BECOME MORE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST
REFLECTS THIS AND BRINGS ALBERTO BACK TO HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 24 HR
AND TO 85 KT BY 72 HR. 

ALTHOUGH THE FORECAST TRACK HAS ALBERTO PASSING WELL EAST OF
BERMUDA...RESIDENTS OF THE ISLAND SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
THE STORM UNTIL IT HAS SAFELY PASSED.

ALBERTO HAS CONTINUED TO ORGANIZE THIS AFTERNOON...WITH THE
OCCASIONAL APPEARANCE OF A BANDING EYE.  SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE ALL 65 KT...SO ALBERTO IS UPGRADED BACK TO MINIMAL
HURRICANE STATUS.

THE HURRICANE IS NOW MOVING 320/19.  THE ACCELERATION APPEARS TO BE
DUE TO THE LARGE UPPER LEVEL LOW TO THE SOUTHWEST.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW A RIDGE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE...SO THE
CURRENT SPEED IS NOT LIKELY TO LAST AFTER ALBERTO MOVES AWAY FROM
THE UPPER LOW.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY ALSO SHOWS THE FORECAST
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE NORTHEAST U.S.. THIS
SYSTEM WILL EVENTUALLY RECURVE ALBERTO.  ALL TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
CALL FOR A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH AND EVEN EAST OF NORTH BY 72
HR.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS...WITH SOME DECELERATION AS
ALBERTO MOVES THROUGH THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.
 
THE UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW IS STILL QUITE ASYMMETRIC AS UPPER LEVEL
SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW IS BLOWING ACROSS THE HURRICANE.  HOWEVER...THE
FASTER FORWARD MOTION HAS REDUCED THE STORM-RELATIVE SHEAR...
ALLOWING ALBERTO TO STRENGTHEN.  CONDITIONS SHOULD REMAIN FAVORABLE
FOR STRENGTHENING FOR THE NEXT 48 HR AS ALBERTO MOVES OVER WARM
WATER.  AFTER THAT...GRADUALLY COOLING SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES
SHOULD STOP INTENSIFICATION.
 
ALTHOUGH THE FORECAST TRACK HAS ALBERTO PASSING WELL EAST OF
BERMUDA...RESIDENTS OF THE ISLAND SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
THE STORM UNTIL IT HAS SAFELY PASSED.

INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGED FROM 55 TO 77 KT DUE TO THIS
UNCERTAINTY...AND I HAVE SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND KEPT ALBERTO AT

THE FORWARD SPEED HAS INCREASED A BIT MORE AS ALBERTO MOVES PAST THE
LARGE UPPER LOW AND IS NOW 320/20.  THE SYNOPTIC REASONING REMAINS
THE SAME AS BEFORE...AND SOME REDUCTION IN FORWARD SPEED IS
EXPECTED.  TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE IN EXCELLENT AGREEMENT ON A
NORTHWEST MOTION FOR 24-36 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A TURN TO THE NORTH.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.
 
THE UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW IS BECOMING WELL ESTABLISHED TO THE NORTH OF

THE CONVECTIVE PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH ALBERTO HAS NOT CHANGED
DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AND ONLY THE OUTFLOW THAT HAS BECOME A
LITTLE BETTER ESTABLISHED.  SATELLITE ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT
MAXIMUM WINDS REMAIN AT 65 KNOTS.  BECAUSE ALBERTO IS ABOUT TO MOVE
OVER WARMER WATERS AND WITHIN AN AREA OF DECREASING SHEAR...SOME
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED.  HOWEVER...IT ONLY HAS ABOUT 36 HOURS TO
DO IT.
 
ALBERTO IS CURRENTLY MOVING TOWARD THE NORTHWEST ABOUT 18 KNOTS
AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  THE COMBINATION
OF A TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO SWING EASTWARD ACROSS THE EAST
COAST OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE ADJACENT ATLANTIC WITH THE
SUBTROPICAL HIGH WILL STEER ALBERTO NORTHWEST AND NORTHWARD THROUGH
36 HOURS AND THEN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.  TRACK MODELS ARE IN
EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WITH THIS TRACK BUT DIFFER IN THE SPEED.
 
BY 72 HOURS...ALBERTO SHOULD BEGIN TO LOSE TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS
OVER THE COOLER WATERS OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC.

THE CENTRAL CONVECTION OF ALBERTO HAS BECOME A LITTLE RAGGED THIS
MORNING...AND A WESTWARD ELONGATION OF THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN
SUGGESTS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW TO THE SOUTH IS CAUSING EASTERLY SHEAR. 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE 77

WINDS AND A 1003.6 MB PRESSURE JUST WEST OF THE CENTER.  ON THIS
BASIS...ALBERTO REMAINS A 65 KT HURRICANE.

ALBERTO CONTINUES MOVING 320/18 AROUND THE WESTERN SIDE OF A STRONG
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  ALL LARGE-SCALE AND NHC TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE
INDICATES THE HURRICANE SHOULD TURN NORTH AND THEN NORTHEAST OVER
THE NEXT 72 HR IN RESPONSE TO THE DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE
NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND THE CANADIAN MARITIMES.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
SUPPORTS THE GUIDANCE...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS RIGHT DOWN THE
MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE.

WHILE THE UPPER LEVEL LOW IS STILL CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR ALBERTO...
THE STORM SHOULD BE MOVING AWAY FROM IT INTO A MORE FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT IN THE NEXT 24 HR.  THIS WOULD ALLOW SOME STRENGTHENING. 
STRENGTHENING SHOULD END BY 48 HR AS ALBERTO STARTS MOVING INTO

APPEARANCE IN INFRARED IMAGERY...AND A 2244Z TRMM OVERPASS SHOWING A
CIRCULAR 24 NM DIAMETER EYE IN THE LOW-LEVEL 37GHZ CHANNELS. THE
OUTFLOW PATTERN REMAINS CIRCULAR WITH LITTLE OR NO SHEAR EVIDENT.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 030/16.  SATELLITE FIX POSITIONS HAVE BEEN

TRACK THROUGH 36 HOURS...WITH ONLY A SLIGHT SOUTHWARD ADJUSTMENT IN
LINE WITH THE UKMET...GFDN AND NOGAPS MODELS. THE GFDL MODEL IS THE
MOST SOUTHERN AND SLOWEST OF ALL THE MODELS. HOWEVER...A SHARP
EASTWARD TRACK SEEMS UNLIKELY GIVEN THE SMALL OMEGA- OR REX-TYPE
BLOCKING PATTERN TO THE EAST WHICH SHOULD ACT TO DRIVE THE SYSTEM
FARTHER NORTH TO NEAR 40N LATITUDE BEFORE TURNING TO THE EAST.

GIVEN THE TENACITY OF ALBERTO...IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF THE
HURRICANE MADE ONE MORE GASP AT TRYING TO ACHIEVE MAJOR HURRICANE
INTENSITY DURING THE DIURNAL CONVECTIVE MAXIMUM PERIOD TONIGHT.
AFTER 12 HOURS...ALBERTO WILL BE MOVING OVER MUCH COOLER WATER...25C

INTENSITY MODEL TAKES ALBERTO TO 100 KT IN 12 HOURS AND THEN RAPIDLY
WEAKENS THE SYSTEM AFTERWARDS TO MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM IN 72 HOURS.
WE HAVE KEPT THE INTENSITY HIGHER IN THE LATER PERIODS DUE TO

INTENSITY MODEL INDICATES THAT THIS IS ABOUT AS STRONG AS ALBERTO
WILL GET AS THE SSTS ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK WILL START GETTING
COOLER WITHIN 12 HOURS.  THE HURRICANE SHOULD BECOME EXTRATROPICAL
BY 48 HOURS OR SO WHEN SSTS ARE NEAR 20 DEGREES C.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 050/13.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS BASED
ON THE FORWARD SPEED REACHING ABOUT 30 KNOTS BY 36 HOURS AS THE
HURRICANE BECOMES EMBEDDED IN WESTERLIES.  THE TRACK IS SOMEWHAT
SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY FOLLOWING THE GFDL AND UKMET
MODELS.

ALBERTO HAS A VERY DISTINCT EYE WITH EXCELLENT PRESENTATION ON HIGH
RESOLUTION VIS IMAGES AND ON MICROWAVE DATA.  T-NUMBERS FROM TAFB
AND OBJECTIVES HAVE REACHED 6.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE AND CONTINUE
ABOUT 5.5 FROM SAB.  INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN INCREASED TO 110
KNOTS BUT ALBERTO PROBABLY HAS ALREADY PEAKED AND SHOULD BEGIN TO
GRADUALLY WEAKEN TODAY AS THE IT MOVES OVER INCREASINGLY COOLER
WATERS.  THIS MAKES ALBERTO A STRONG CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE ON THE
SAFFIR/SIMPSON HURRICANE SCALE.    

ALBERTO IS ALREADY EMBEDDED WITHIN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW NORTH OF
THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND AHEAD OF A DEVELOPING TROUGH. THE
HURRICANE SHOULD THEN CONTINUE MOVING TOWARD THE NORTHEAST ABOUT 15
KNOTS AND THEN EAST WITH A GRADUAL INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED.  THE
CENTER OF ALBERTO SHOULD PASS NORTH OF THE AZORES BETWEEN 48 AND 72
HOURS AS A POWERFUL EXTRATROPICAL SYSTEM.  THIS IS BASICALLY THE
SOLUTION OF THE UK MODEL AND SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.
HOWEVER...MOST OF MODELS SHOW ONLY A MODEST INCREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED AND THE PASSAGE NORTH OF NEAR THE AZORES AT 72 HOURS.

ALBERTO IS MOVING 065/15 AT THIS TIME.  THE HURRICANE IS EMBEDDED
WITHIN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW NORTH OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND
AHEAD OF A DEVELOPING TROUGH. THEREFORE IT SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE
SAME GENERAL TRACK.   HOWEVER...MODELS HAVE CHANGED THIS AFTERNOON
AND UNANIMOUSLY SLOW DOWN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE AND TURN IT TOWARD
THE SOUTHEAST AROUND A DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE FAR EASTERN NORTH
ATLANTIC.  THIS SOLUTION WAS FIRST SUGGESTED BY THE MRF/AVN AND NOW
EVEN THE UK MODEL HAS JOINED THE CLUB.  WITH SUCH A CHANGE...I HAVE
NO CHOICE BUT TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST BY
SLOWING DOWN THE HURRICANE BEYOND 48 HOURS AND TURNING IT A LITTLE
BIT TO THE SOUTHEAST.  THIS MEANS THAT IF ALBERTO DOES NOT BECOME
EXTRATROPICAL AS ANTICIPATED IT COULD BECOME A THREAT TO THE AZORES.

ALBERTO CONTINUES WITH WINDS UP TO 110 KNOTS BUT IS ALREADY CROSSING
THE 26 DEGREE ISOTHERM AND HEADING FOR COOLER WATER.  A GRADUAL
WEAKENING SHOULD THEN BEGIN.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST STILL INDICATES
THAT ALBERTO WILL BECOME EXTRATROPICAL IN 48 HOURS BUT THIS FORECAST
IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME AND BECAUSE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE
OVER LOWER LATITUDES...ALBERTO MAY LAST LONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY
FORECAST.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT SAT AUG 12 2000
 
HURRICANE ALBERTO HAS RAPIDLY WEAKENED DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS AS
THE CYCLONE HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASING WESTERLY SHEAR. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY OF 100 KT IS BASED ON 00Z SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF
95 AND 100 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB...RESPECTIVELY...AND ALSO A RAGGED
CLOUD-FILLED EYE IN RECENT SATELLITE IMAGERY. OUTFLOW REMAINS GOOD
IN THE EAST SEMICIRCLE...FAIR TO THE SOUTHWEST AND RESTRICTED TO THE
NORTHWEST.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK
THOUGH 36 HOURS..AND A LITTLE EAST AFTERWARDS. ALL OF THE FORECAST
MODEL TRACKS ARE A LITTLE FURTHER EAST THAN PREVIOUS RUNS...POSSIBLY
DUE TO MORE LOW- AND MID-LEVEL STEERING AS THE UPPER-LEVEL
CIRCULATION DECOUPLES FROM THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER DUE TO EXPECTED
WEAKENING CONVECTION. THE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC LOW CURRENTLY SOUTH OF
THE AZORES AS SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY IS FORECAST BY THE AVN
MODEL TO GRADUALLY FILL AND LIFT OUT TO THE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE
AZORES AFTER 36 HOURS...LEAVING BEHIND A BROAD WEAK TROUGH. THE
SURFACE TO 700 MB SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE SOUTH IS FORECAST TO
REMAIN INTACT...WHICH MAY ACT TO KEEP ALBERTO ON A MORE EASTERLY
TRACK TOWARD THE AZORES BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
WESTERLY SHEAR IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE DUE TO THE SMALL BLOCKING
PATTERN TO THE EAST. COMBINE THE SHEAR WITH PROGRESSIVELY COOLER
SSTS...25C TO 23C...AND THE INGREDIENTS ARE THERE FOR STEADY AND
POSSIBLE RAPID WEAKENING. THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL TAKES ALBERTO
DOWN BELOW TROPICAL DEPRESSION INTENSITY BY 72 HOURS...BUT WE HAVE
KEPT THE INTENSITY HIGHER DUE TO EXPECTED EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION.

WESTERLY SHEAR HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE...ALTHOUGH THE OUTFLOW
REMAINS FAIR TO GOOD IN ALL QUADRANTS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 080/14.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR FORECAST
MODELS TRACK ALBERTO TO THE EAST WITH A GRADUAL DECREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED AS THE SYSTEM TRACKS OVER THE TOP OF A REX-TYPE BLOCKING HIGH
AND THEN DROPS SOUTHWARD INTO A BROAD TROUGH.  WE HAVE CLOSELY
FOLLOWED THE UKMET...GFDL...AND AVN MODEL SOULTIONS...AND THE
OFFICIAL TRACK IS JUST A LITTLE EAST OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK AFTER 36

STEADY WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS THE HURRICANE TARCKS OVER COOLER
WATER...ENCOUNTERS MORE UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLY SHEAR AS THE SYSTEM
SLOWS DOWN...AND POSSIBLE INTERACTION WITH A WEAK BAROCLINIC ZONE
JUST NORTH OF THE CYCLONE. IT IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT

STEERED AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A MID-LEVEL BLOCKING HIGH OVER THE

THIS IS A MUCH MORE DRASTIC TURN THAN INDICATED IN EARLIER
ADVISORIES...BUT IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN
AND THE CONSENSUS OF THE GFDL...U.K. MET OFFICE...AND NOGAPS MODEL
RUNS. 

THERE IS LITTLE...IF ANY...DEEP CONVECTION REMAINING AND AS SUCH IT
IS HARD TO CLASSIFY THIS AS A TROPICAL SYSTEM.  MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
DECREASED TO 45 KNOTS AND A VERY SLOW SPINDOWN OF THIS LARGE
CIRCULATION IS FORECAST.  IF THE SYSTEM REMAINS VOID OF DEEP

WHAT CONVECTION THAT IS LEFT WITH ALBERTO IS DISPLACED TO THE
SOUTHEAST OF THE EXPOSED LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER.  DVORAK
SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS GIVE 25 TO 30 KT...BUT ARE NOT ESPECIALLY
APPLICABLE FOR THIS SEMI-TROPICAL SYSTEM IN WHICH THE STRONGEST
WINDS ARE LOCATED WELL AWAY FROM THE CENTER.  ADVANCED MICROWAVE
SOUNDER UNIT DATA FROM 11Z THIS MORNING...COURTESY OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN/CIMSS WEB PAGE...STILL SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL WARM CORE.
ALL AVAILABLE INTENSITY GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT SOME
REINTENSIFICATION WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS AS ALBERTO
PASSES OVER SLIGHTLY WARMER WATER.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A
LITTLE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC.
 
ALBERTO CONTINUES TO EXECUTE AN ANTICYCLONIC TURN AND THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOW 225/8.  A GENERAL WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY MOTION IS
EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS OR SO.  THE AVN AND UKMET GLOBAL
MODELS SHOW THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE WEST OF ALBERTO ERODING AS THE
TROUGH CURRENTLY OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST ADVANCES EASTWARD.  A
SECOND TROUGH IS FORECAST TO MOVE OFF NORTH AMERICA IN TWO DAYS AND
SHOULD THEN BEGIN TO LIFT ALBERTO MORE NORTHWARD.  THE UKMET IS MUCH
STRONGER IN ITS DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECOND TROUGH AND THEREFORE
INDICATES A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN
BETWEEN THE GFDL...WHICH HAS BEEN DOING VERY WELL WITH ALBERTO...AND
THE UKMET.

ALBERTO DOES NOT LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE ON IR SATELLITE IMAGES BUT THE
CLOUD PATTERN IS A LITTLE BETTER ORGANIZED THAT 24 HOURS AGO.  SHIP
WCOB REPORTED WINDS OF 35 KNOTS FROM THE WEST-SOUTHWEST ABOUT 90 N
MI SOUTH OF THE CENTER.  IN ADDITION...MICROWAVE DATA FROM A RECENT
PASSAGE OVER ALBERTO REVEAL A WELL DEFINED CIRCULATION WITH 40 TO 45
KNOT WINDS.  DUE TO THE LACK OF DEEP CONVECTION...THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS KEPT AT 45 KNOTS.

ALBERTO IS MOVING TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST ABOUT 7 OR 8 KNOTS AROUND A
STRONG MID-LEVEL HIGH LOCATED TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE.  ALBERTO SHOULD TURN MORE TO THE WEST AND WEST-NORTHWEST IN
ABOUT 48 HOURS AS THE HIGH SHIFTS EASTWARD.  THIS IS THE GENERAL
SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF THE MODELS INCLUDING THE FSU
EXPERIMENTAL SUPERENSEMBLE. 

ALBERTO IS MOVING TOWARD WARMER WATERS AND INTO A LOWER SHEAR
ENVIRONMENT...SO THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A SMALL
INCREASE IN INTENSITY BEYOND 48 HOURS.

THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN ALBERTO THIS MORNING AS WEAK CONVECTIVE
BANDS CONTINUE NEAR THE CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM AFWA...TAFB...AND SAB ARE 35 KT...30 KT... AND 30 KT. 
HOWEVER...WITH THE LARGE SIZE OF THE CIRCULATION AND EARLIER SHIP
AND SCATTEROMETER DATA...THE MAXIMUM WINDS WILL REMAIN 40 KT. 
ANOTHER QUIKSCAT OVERPASS SHOULD OCCUR IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS...WHICH
SHOULD HELP DETERMINE IF ALBERTO IS WEAKENING FURTHER.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 230/8.  CONVENTIONAL INFRARED AND WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SHOW A LARGE DEEP LAYER ANTICYCLONE NORTHWEST OF ALBERTO. 
LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THIS FEATURE SHOULD SHIFT EASTWARD
THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND THAT ALBERTO SHOULD MOVE AROUND
THE SOUTH SIDE OF IT.  NHC TRACK GUIDANCE GENERALLY AGREES WITH
THIS...WITH THE MAIN DISAGREEMENT BEING HOW QUICKLY THE STORM WILL
TURN NORTHWARD ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE ANTICYCLONE.  THE AVN...THE
BAM MODELS...AND THE UKMET FAVOR A SHARP TURN TO THE NORTH AFTER 48
HR... WHILE THE GFDL...LBAR...AND NHC90 INDICATE MORE WESTERLY
MOTIONS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST COMPROMISES BETWEEN THESE TWO
EXTREMES AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

ALTHOUGH CONVECTION IS CURRENTLY MINIMAL...ALBERTO IS MOVING TOWARD
GRADUALLY WARMER WATERS.  THE AVN AND NOGAPS SUGGEST THAT CURRENT
NORTHERLY SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM SHOULD SUBSIDE BY 48 HR...WHILE THE
UKMET KEEPS SIGNIFICANT SHEAR IN PLACE.  SINCE THE SOUTH SIDES OF
DEEP LAYER ANTICYCLONES ARE OFTEN FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTS FOR
INTENSIFICATION...THE INTENSITY FORECAST FOLLOWS THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST IN CALLING FOR A SMALL INCREASE IN INTENSITY BEYOND 36
HOURS.

ALTHOUGH THE SCATTEROMETER PASS THIS MORNING SUGGESTED THAT ALBERTO
WAS SPINNING DOWN...NEW CONVECTION...THE MOST VIGOROUS IN AT LEAST
24 HOURS...HAS DEVELOPED ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE AND THERE HAS BEEN
IMPROVEMENT IN THE BANDING PATTERN.  THEREFORE...THE INITIAL
INTENSITY NOT DECREASED BUT IS HELD AT 40 KT.
 
ALBERTO IS ACCELERATING TO THE SOUTHWEST.  THE MOTION OVER THE PAST
TWELVE HOURS HAS BEEN 230/11...AND FASTER THAN THAT OVER THE PAST
SIX...AS ALBERTO MOVES AROUND A LARGE DEEP LAYER HIGH TO THE 
NORTHWEST OF THE CYCLONE.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THIS FEATURE
SHOULD SHIFT EASTWARD THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND THAT ALBERTO
SHOULD MOVE AROUND THE SOUTH SIDE OF IT.  IN THE SHORT TERM...THE
MAIN QUESTION IS HOW QUICKLY THE STORM WILL TURN NORTHWARD ON THE
WEST SIDE OF THE ANTICYCLONE.  THE AVN...THE BAM MODELS...AND THE
UKMET FAVOR A SHARP TURN TO THE NORTH AFTER 48 HR... WHILE THE GFDL
AND LBAR FAVOR MORE WESTERLY MOTIONS.  THE EXPERIMENTAL FSU
SUPERENSEMBLE IS IN BETWEEN BUT NOT FAR FROM THE GFDL.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST BASED ON THE
CURRENT ACCELERATION AND IS BETWEEN THE GFDL AND SUPERENSEMBLE.

RESPONDING.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE BRINGS ALBERTO TO NEARLY

ALBERTO CONTINUES TO SHOW SIGNS OF RENEWED HEALTH...AS DEEP COLD
CONVECTION...COLDER THAN -70C...IS NOW PRESENT ON ITS SOUTHEAST
SIDE.  THE LOW AND MID LEVEL CIRCULATIONS ARE STILL NOT QUITE
COINCIDENT.  SATELLITE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 30 AND 35 KT. 
ALBERTO IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A TRANSFORMATION FROM A SEMI-
TROPICAL TO A MORE CLASSICAL TROPICAL STRUCTURE.  AS THE WIND FIELD
TIGHTENS UP IN RESPONSE TO THE CONVECTION THE SATELLITE
CLASSIFICATIONS WILL CATCH UP AND GIVE A BETTER REPRESENTATION OF
THE ACTUAL INTENSITY.  WITH RELATIVELY WARMER WATER AND RELATIVELY
LOW SHEAR...THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL BRINGS ALBERTO BACK TO
HURRICANE STATUS IN 60 HOURS.  THE FORECAST INTENSITY IS INCREASED

IN 72 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 240/13...EVEN FASTER THAN THIS MORNING.  THERE
IS CONSIDERABLE SPREAD IN THE GUIDANCE ON JUST HOW LONG THE WESTWARD
COMPONENT OF MOTION WILL PERSIST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REMAINS

ALBERTO CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER-ORGANIZED AND IS NOW LOOKING VERY
MUCH LIKE A TROPICAL CYCLONE AGAIN.  THERE IS A CONCENTRATION OF
CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER...ALTHOUGH THE CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED
SOMEWHAT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL NOT QUITE
VERTICALLY STACKED AS MICROWAVE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION CENTER IS LOCATED A LITTLE TO THE NORTH OF THE MID-
LEVEL CENTER.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 45 KNOTS FROM TAFB
MIAMI AND SAB WASHINGTON...AND THIS IS USED FOR THE CURRENT
INTENSITY.  CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY SINCE THE OCEAN IS
RELATIVELY WARM AND THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS NOT STRONG.  ALBERTO IS
LIKELY TO REGAIN HURRICANE STATUS IN A DAY OR TWO.  THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY FORECAST...WHICH MAY BE CONSERVATIVE...IS SIMILAR TO THE
SHIPS GUIDANCE.

THE FORWARD SPEED HAS SLOWED A BIT AND MOTION IS NOW 240/11. 
ALBERTO IS MOVING AROUND THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF A BLOCKING MID-
TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE AND A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE WEST... THEN
NORTHWEST...AND THEN NORTH...IS LIKELY DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THAT FROM
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE...INCLUDING THE
GFDL...U.K. MET. OFFICE...AND AVN MODEL RUNS INDICATE A TRACK EVEN
FARTHER TO THE EAST.  ALTHOUGH ALBERTO IS VERY CLOSE TO THE FAST
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE BROAD U.S. EAST COAST TROUGH AT 72
HRS...THE NUMERICAL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE CYCLONE WILL NOT BE
PICKED UP AND ACCELERATED NORTHEASTWARD AT THAT TIME.  THUS ALBERTO
MAY EARN SOME NEW LONGEVITY RECORDS IN THE COMING DAYS.

INITIAL MOTION FOR THIS ADVISORY IS 260/6.  SATELLITE IMAGERY AND
LARGE-SCALE MODELS SHOW A DEEP LAYER ANTICYCLONE NORTHWEST OF

MOVE WEST FOR 12-24 HR FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH...

EASTWARD...WHICH ALLOW THE STORM TO TURN NORTH WITH TIME.  NHC TRACK
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO AGREE WITH THIS...WITH THE PRIMARY PROBLEM
BEING HOW FAST ALBERTO WILL MOVE....WHERE THE GUIDANCE IS SPLIT INTO
TWO CLUSTERS.  A RELATIVELY SLOWER CLUSTER INCLUDES THE AVN...
NHC90...THE BAM MODELS...LBAR...AND VICBAR.  A RELATIVELY FASTER
CLUSTER INCLUDES THE GFDN...GFDL...UKMET...AND NOGAPS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST GOES WITH THE FASTER CLUSTER IS AND SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.
 
ALBERTO CONTINUES IN A LIGHT SHEAR ENVIRONMENT AND SHOWS FAIR TO
GOOD OUTFLOW EVERYWHERE EXCEPT TO THE NORTHEAST.  WITH THE EYE
FORMING...IT IS LIKELY TO REGAIN HURRICANE STRENGTH LATER TODAY. 
THE FORECAST TRACK TAKE ALBERTO NORTH OF THE NORTH WALL OF THE GULF
STREAM BY 72 HR...AND THUS THE INTENSITY FORECAST STOPS
INTENSIFICATION AND WEAKENS THE STORM SLIGHTLY AT THAT TIME

ALBERTO HAS DEVELOPED A 30 NM DIAMETER RAGGED EYE DURING THE PAST 6
HOURS...AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 60 TO 65 KT FROM THE
VARIOUS SATELLITE AGENCIES. BASED ON THE EYE FEATURE...ALBERTO IS
BROUGHT BACK UP TO HURRICANE INTENSITY...FOR THE THIRD TIME. OUTFLOW
IS IS ONLY FAIR...BUT REMAINS CIRCULAR IN ALL QUADRANTS.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 335/7. ALBERTO IS EXPECTED TO TRACK IN A GENERAL
NORTHWARD DIRECTION AROUND THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH
LATITUDE RIDGE. WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE TROUGH TO PICK UP
THE SYSTEM...ONLY A SLOW SPEED BETWEEN 7 TO 10 KT IS FORECAST. THE
OFFICAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO PREVIOUS TRACK...AND NEAR THE GFDL AND
UKMET SOULTIONS.
 
ALBERTO WILL REMIAN OVER MAGINALLY WARM SSTS...SO SOME SLOW
INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST.  THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE SHIPS MODEL

ALBERTO HAS CONTINUED TO INTENSIFY DESPITE THE LARGE 40 NM DIAMETER
EYE.  SATELLITE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN NEAR 90 KT FOR THE PAST 6 TO 12
HOURS...SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN INCREASED.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 360/5.  THERE REMAINS LITTLE CHANGE IN EITHER

THE WESTERN SIDE OF A LARGE RIDGE...WHILE A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST U.S. AND SOUTHEAST CANADA MOVES EAST. THE
ENTIRE TROUGH-RIDGE PATTERN IS FORECAST TO SHIFT EASTWARD THROUGH 48

IN THE TRACK. THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BEGIN PICKING
UP ALBERTO UNTIL AFTER 48 HOURS...AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS CLOSE TO

ALBERTO HAS LIKELY PEAKED IN INTENSITY SINCE THE SYSTEM IS NOW
BEGINNING TO MOVE OVER COOLER WATER.  BY 72 HOURS...ALBERTO IS
EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER 20C OR COLDER SSTS WHICH SHOULD HELP TO
RAPIDLY WEAKEN THE SYSTEM...BUT THE INTENSITY WAS HELD SLIGHTLY
HIGHER THAN THE SHIPS MODEL AFTER 48 HOURS.  THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO
THE LARGE SIZE OF THE INNER CORE WIND FIELD WHICH WILL TAKE SOME
TIME TO SPIN DOWN EVEN THOUGH ALBERTO MAY BE DEVOID OF ANY DEEP

NORTHEAST AFTER 24 HOURS THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS

CYCLONE TO AN EXTRATROPICAL SYSTEM AFTER 48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECASTS...AND BETWEEN THE GFDL AND

ALBERTO WILL BE TRACKING OVER PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATER THROUGHOUT

ALBERTO CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT A LARGE...45 N MI DIAMETER...EYE FILLED
WITH LOW CLOUDS.  TAKING THE AVERAGE OF DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
GIVES ABOUT 75 KNOTS FOR THE CURRENT WIND SPEED.  MUCH COOLER WATERS
SHOULD BRING ABOUT WEAKENING AND THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE LOSING
TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS TOMORROW.  ALBERTO IS EXPECTED TO BECOME
ABSORBED INTO A LARGE EXTRATROPICAL LOW OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC IN A
COUPLE OF DAYS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION CONTINUES AT 020/5.  THE HURRICANE SHOULD BE
ACCELERATED NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD BY INCREASING FLOW ON THE EAST SIDE
OF A LARGE TROUGH MOVING OFF THE EAST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE SOLUTION GIVEN BY THE NCEP
GLOBAL MODEL...WHICH SHOULD HANDLE SUCH SYSTEMS QUITE WELL.

WIND RADII HAVE BEEN MADE HIGHLY ASYMMETRIC LATER IN THE
PERIOD...CONSISTENT WITH THE EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION.

THE PERSISTENT SMALL LOW EAST OF THE CENTRAL FLORIDA COAST HAS
DEVELOPED INTO TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR.  THE ASSOCIATED CONVECTION
IS STILL RATHER SPORADIC AND DISORGANIZED.  INDEED...THE SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 25 KT AND TOO WEAK TO CLASSIFY.  HOWEVER...
THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION APPEARS BETTER DEFINED THAN YESTERDAY. IT
MUST BE NOTED THAT THE SYSTEM IS SMALL...WITH 30 KT MAXIMUM WINDS
CONFINED TO WITHIN 60 NM OF THE CENTER.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/3.  THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY IN A WEAK
STEERING ENVIRONMENT CAUSED BY THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND A LARGER
TROPICAL WAVE TO THE EAST.  THIS IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE FOR THE
NEXT 24 HR OR SO.  AFTER THAT...A STRONG MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND
ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT WILL INTENSIFY OVER THE EASTERN U.S...WHICH
SHOULD SWEEP THE SYSTEM OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC.  NHC TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE AGREES WITH THIS...ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE
DETAILS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO.

IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT IS HOLDING THE SYSTEM TOGETHER GIVEN THE LACK
OF PERSISTENT CONVECTION.  WHILE THERE IS CURRENTLY EASTERLY SHEAR
OVER THE CENTER...LARGE-SCALE MODELS FORECAST THE ENVIRONMENT TO
BECOME MORE FAVORABLE.  THE SHIPS MODEL TAKES THE DEPRESSION TO
HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 72 HR.  THE INTENSITY WILL NOT FOLLOW THAT. 
INSTEAD... THE FORECAST INTENSITY WILL STAY 30 KT UNTIL MORE
PERSISTENT CONVECTION FORMS.

A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 1010 MB AND 39 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS 7 NM
NORTHWEST OF THE CENTER.  THIS SHOWS THAT DESPITE THE LACK OF
PERSISTENT CONVECTION THE DEPRESSION HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN STRUCTURE
SINCE YESTERDAY.  THE MAXIMUM WINDS REMAIN AT 30 KT FOR THIS
ADVISORY.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/4.  THE DEPRESSION REMAINS IN A WEAK
STEERING ENVIRONMENT CAUSED BY THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND A LARGER
TROPICAL WAVE TO THE EAST.  THIS IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE FOR THE
NEXT 24 HR OR SO.  AFTER THAT...A STRONG MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND
ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT WILL INTENSIFY OVER THE EASTERN U.S. 
LARGE-SCALE MODELS SUGGEST THE LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD BECOME WEST TO
SOUTHWEST BY 36-48 HR...WHICH SHOULD STEER THE CYCLONE OUT TO SEA. 
NHC TRACK GUIDANCE AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO...AGAIN WITH SOME
DISAGREEMENTS ON DETAILS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS
SCENARIO AND IS SHIFTED A LITTLE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES TO PRODUCE SMALL PUFFS OF CONVECTION WHICH
ARE SHEARED AWAY BY UPPER LEVEL EASTERLY FLOW.  NO INTENSIFICATION
IS FORECAST UNTIL THE SYSTEM SHOWS IT CAN DEVELOP PERSISTENT
CONVECTION.  THIS MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN THE SHEAR LETS UP IN 24 HR OR

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE TROPICAL
DEPRESSION THIS EVENING...AS IT CONTINUES TO GENERATE VERY LITTLE
CONVECTION.  BUOY 41010...LOCATED ABOUT 50 NM TO THE NORTH OF THE
CENTER...HAS BEEN REPORTING WINDS OF ABOUT 20 KT.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY REMAINS AT 30 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/5...ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE.  THE
DEPRESSION IS IN A WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT TO THE SOUTHWEST OF A
TROPICAL WAVE.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS DEVELOP A SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING
CURRENT IN ABOUT 24 HOURS AS THE WAVE LIFTS OUT...AND ALL MODEL
GUIDANCE INDICATES A TURN TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST.  ONLY THE LBAR
INDICATES A LANDFALL ON THE UPPER FLORIDA COAST.  I HAVE ADJUSTED
THE FORECAST A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...BECAUSE
OF THE CONTINUED WESTWARD MOTION THIS EVENING AND BECAUSE I AM
UNSURE WHETHER THE SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING FLOW CAN BE ESTABLISHED AS
QUICKLY AS THE MODELS INDICATE...AND AM THEREFORE ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.

UNTIL THE DEPRESSION CAN MAINTAIN CONVECTION IT WILL HAVE A
DIFFICULT TIME INTENSIFYING.  MODELS INDICATE THAT THE SOUTHEASTERLY
SHEAR WILL DIMINISH OVER THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS AND AT THAT TIME
THE SYSTEM COULD BECOME A TINY TROPICAL STORM.  BY THIS TIME THE
SYSTEM SHOULD ALREADY BE MOVING AWAY FROM THE COAST.  GIVEN THE
SMALL SIZE OF THE CIRCULATION AND THE FACT THAT I AM WELL LEFT OF
THE GUIDANCE...NO TROPICAL STORM WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE NEEDED AT

APPEARS TO BE MOVING 035/6.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DEEP LAYER
TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN U.S. IS HAVING MORE AFFECT ON THE
DEPRESSION THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED.  NHC TRACK GUIDANCE IS IN
AGREEMENT THAT THE TROUGH WILL MOVE THE DEPRESSION NORTHEASTWARD
BETWEEN CAPE HATTERAS AND BERMUDA...WITH THE ONLY DISAGREEMENT BEING
HOW FAST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED TO THE EAST OF THE
PREVIOUS TRACK AND IS SLOWER THAN MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.  THIS IS TO
GUARD AGAINST THIS BEING A RE-FORMATION OF THE CENTER RATHER THAN A
TRUE MOTION.

WHILE THE DEPRESSION IS UNDER EASTERLY SHEAR...LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE
SUGGESTS THIS WILL DECREASE AS UPPER LEVEL WESTERLIES WEAKEN THE
RIDGE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION.  THIS WOULD ALLOW A MORE FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT AFTER 24 HR.  THE INTENSITY GUIDANCE AND INTENSITY
FORECAST BOTH FOLLOW THIS IDEA...WITH THE FORECAST CALL FOR LESS
INTENSIFICATION THAN THE GUIDANCE DUE TO THE CURRENT LACK OF
CONCENTRATED CONVECTION.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR DURING THE
DAY...AS SPORADIC PUFFS OF CONVECTION ERUPT IN THE LOW CLOUD SWIRL
AND QUICKLY DIE.  THE MAXIMUM WINDS REMAIN AT 30 KT IN THIS
ADVISORY.  HOWEVER...SINCE THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS RISEN A LITTLE
AND THE TIGHT CORE SEEN YESTERDAY HAS DISSIPATED...IT MIGHT BE A
LITTLE WEAKER.

THE CYCLONE MOVED 090/5 DURING THE DAY...ALTHOUGH RECENT SATELLITE
IMAGERY SUGGESTS A POSSIBLY SLOWER MOTION.  THE SYNOPTIC SCENARIO IS
BECOMING COMPLEX.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THE STRONG UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL TRIGGER SOME KIND OF SURFACE
DEVELOPMENT EITHER OVER THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES OR JUST OFF THE
COAST.  THE NOGAPS EVEN USES T.D. 4 TO TRIGGER THIS DEVELOPMENT. IF
THE BAROCLINIC LOW FORMS...THE LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD BE STRONG
ENOUGH TO WHISK T.D. 4 OFF TO THE NORTHEAST.  A COMPLICATING FACTOR
IS THE DISTURBANCE EAST-NORTHEAST OF T.D. 4.  IT IS LARGER THAN THE
DEPRESSION AND IT COULD KEEP T.D. 4 ON A MORE SOUTHERLY AND SLOWER
TRACK...ESPECIALLY IF IT DEVELOPS INTO A TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN A FASTER TRACK CLOSER TO
THE BAROCLINIC LOW AND A SLOWER TRACK CAUSED BY THE DISTURBANCE...
AND IS VERY CLOSE TO THE BAMS AND BAMM.
 
LARGE-SCALE MODELS FORECAST THAT THE CURRENTLY EASTERLY SHEAR WILL
DIMINISH IN THE NEXT 12 HR OR SO.  SHOULD THIS HAPPEN...IT COULD
ALLOW THE DEPRESSION TO STRENGTHEN.  ONE POSSIBILITY TO WATCH FOR IS
THAT TROPICAL CYCLONES MOVING AHEAD OF BAROCLINIC SYSTEMS SOMETIMES
STRENGTHEN CONSIDERABLY...ESPECIALLY WHEN IN THE WARM SECTOR...OVER
WARM WATER...AND EAST OF THE STRONG SHEAR IN THE JET STREAM CORE. 
T.D. 4 (AND THE DISTURBANCE) MAY WIND UP IN THIS SITUATION.  THE
OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT THIS SMALL AND POORLY ORGANIZED CYCLONE
MAY DISSIPATE BEFORE IT HAS A CHANCE TO STRENGTHEN.  THE INTENSITY
FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES.

AS WAS NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST PACKAGE...THERE WAS A
POSSIBILITY THAT THIS SMALL AND POORLY ORGANIZED CYCLONE MIGHT
DISSIPATE BEFORE IT HAD A CHANCE TO STRENGTHEN...AND IT APPEARS THAT
THIS IS THE CASE.

THE STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR CONTINUES TO PREVENT ANY DEVELOPMENT AND
LATEST MODEL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THIS WILL PERSIST OVER THE

EXPECTED TO MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST...GENERATING A FEW ISOLATED

SATELLITE IMAGERY AND REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT INDICATE THAT THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IN
THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO HAS SUFFICIENT ORGANIZATION TO BE
UPGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIVE.  WHILE THE AIRCRAFT HAS NOT
BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE A WELL-DEFINED CENTER OF CIRCULATION...IT DID
FIND FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 34 KT AND ESTIMATED SURFACE WINDS OF 30
KT.  THE UPGRADE IS BASED ON THESE WINDS...AND THE LARGE-SCALE
CIRCULATION EVIDENT ON VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY.  
 
A DEFINITE CENTER WILL LIKELY BE ELUSIVE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12-
24 HOURS.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS STATIONARY.  AVAILABLE
GUIDANCE TAKES THE SYSTEM ON A GENERAL NORTHWESTERLY TRACK AROUND A
MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGH BUILDING EASTWARD FROM THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. 
THE 12Z AVN TAKES THE SYSTEM INLAND IN SOUTH TEXAS IN 48 HOURS...BUT
THE INITIAL POSITION IN THE MODEL APPEARS TO BE ALREADY TOO FAR TO
THE NORTHWEST.   GIVEN THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INITIAL LOCATION AND
MOTION...CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...WHICH FOLLOWS THE AVAILABLE GUIDANCE BUT IS A LITTLE
SLOWER.

RAPID INTENSIFICATION WITH A SYSTEM THIS ILL-DEFINED IS UNLIKELY. 
HOWEVER...SHOULD THE SYSTEM LINGER OVER THE GULF LONGER THAN

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE RECON AIRCRAFT WAS OUT IN TROPICAL DEPRESSION
FIVE FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE AFTERNOON AND FOUND A BROAD LOW-
LEVEL CIRCULATION WITH MULTIPLE SMALL VORTICES ROTATING AROUND THE
INNER EDGE OF THE LARGER ENVELOPE. STRONGEST FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS AT
1000 FT WERE ABOUT 35 KT...SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 30
KT. THIS IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH SUBJECTIVE SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND KGWC.
 
UNTIL A DEFINITE CENTER DEVELOPS...SOME ERRATIC MOTION CAN BE
EXPECTED...ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT WHEN ONLY INFRARED SATELLITE FIXES
WILL BE AVAILABLE. 00Z UPPER AIR DATA INDICATE THE STRONG RIDGE TO
THE NORTH CENTERED OVER NORTHWEST TEXAS HAS MOVED LITTLE DURING THE
PAST 24 HOURS...WHILE THE THROUGH ALONG THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST AND
SOUTH FLORIDA HAS ALSO REMAINED STATIONARY. THE RESULT IS A WEAK
STEERING FLOW PATTERN FOR THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS...AFTER WHICH THE
MODELS ALL BEGIN TO LIFT OUT THE TROUGH TO THE NORTHEAST WHICH
ALLOWS THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE ACROSS CUBA TO BUILD WESTWARD. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...
BUT NOT AS FAR SOUTH AS MOST OF OUR MODEL GUIDANCE. THE GFDL TAKES
THE DEPRESSION FARTHEST NORTH TOWARD CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS IN 48
HOURS...WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE EXCESSIVE AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER...IF
THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE CURRENTLY OVER CUBA BUILDS WESTWARD ACROSS THE
YUCATAN AND UNDERCUTS THE SYSTEM...THEN THIS COULD IMPART A MORE
POLEWARD TRACK...SIMILAR TO THE GFDL...AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY
THE FORECAST TRACK WAS KEPT CLOSE TO MIDLE OF THE FORECAST MODEL
ENVELOPE.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST WAS INCREASED WITH THE DEPRESSION FORECAST TO
REACH TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH TOMORROW AND HURRICANE STRENGTH ON
TUESDAY. THE SHIPS OUTPUT USED IN THE FIRST ADVISORY WAS BASED ON
THE LBAR MODEL TRACK WHICH HAD THE SYSTEM INLAND IN 36 HOURS. THE
LATEST LBAR RUN DOES THE SAME THING. WITH THE DEPRESSION EXPECTED TO
REMAIN LONGER OVER THE VERY WARM WATERS OF THE SOUTHWEST GULF AND IN
A LOW/NO SHEAR ENVIRONMENT...STEADY INTENSIFICATION SEEMS
REASONABLE.

IT IS OF COURSE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER
ON INFRARED IMAGERY...IF IT EXISTS.  I AM PLACING IT NEAR THE CENTER
OF A RECENT BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION FOR LACK OF A BETTER PLACE TO
PUT IT.  PIBALS FROM MEXICO...COURTESY OF NOAA/NSSL PAN AM SOUNDING
NETWORK...SHOW THAT ANY LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION MUST BE SMALL AS A
PIBAL JUST NORTHEAST OF CARMEN SHOWS LIGHT ENE WINDS AT 300 M.  THE
INITIAL MOTION IS ASSUMED TO BE 320/05...ALTHOUGH A STATIONARY
MOTION WAS USED TO INITIALIZE THE TRACK MODELS.  THE MODELS SHOW A
SLOW WEST THROUGH NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR 72 HOURS BASED ON
STEERING FROM A HIGH HOLDING OVER NORTH TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO.  THE
UKMET IS QUITE SLOW NEARING THE SOUTH TEXAS COAST IN 72 HOURS WHILE
THE GFDL SHOWS A LANDFALL IN 24 HOURS JUST SOUTH OF THE US/MEX
BORDER.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THESE EXTREMES WITH A
LANDFALL IN 36 TO 48 HOURS NEAR THE BORDER.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE FROM 35 KNOTS FROM TAFB TO 25
KNOTS FROM SAB AND AFWA BASED ON LARGE VARIATIONS IN CENTER
POSITION.  THE INITIAL OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS KEPT AT 30 KNOTS BASED
ON A NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE CLOUD PATTERN OVERNIGHT.  HOWEVER IT IS
NOTED THAT THE RECENT CONVECTIVE BURST COULD SIGNAL THE BEGINNING OF
SOME SERIOUS INTENSIFICATION...BUT A RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WILL
TAKE A LOOK AT 12Z.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL SUGGESTS THAT WIND
SPEEDS COULD REACH 70 KNOTS IF THE CENTER REMAINS OVER WATER FOR 72
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TAKES THE WINDS TO 65 KNOTS IN 48
HOURS...ACTUALLY IN ABOUT 42 HOURS...JUST BEFORE THE FORECAST
LANDFALL. 

WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE TO JUSTIFY A TROPICAL STORM WATCH FOR A SMALL
PORTION OF THE SOUTH TEXAS COAST AND NORTHEAST MEXICO...IT IS
RECOMMENDED THAT WE WAIT UNTIL DAYLIGHT AND THE RECON INFORMATION
BEFORE ISSUING ANY WATCHES.

AN AIR FORCE RECON AIRCRAFT IN BERYL THIS EVENING HAS HAD SOME
DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING A SPECIFIC CENTER. THIS IS NOT UNEXPECTED
GIVEN THE DISORGANIZED CONVECTIVE PATTERN SEEN IN THE BROWNSVILLE
WSR-88D RADAR REFLECTIVITY PATTERN. SMALL CONVECTIVE BURSTS HAVE
BEEN FIRING ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE BROAD CIRCULATION CENTER WHICH
HAS RESULTED IN THE SPINUP OF SEVERAL SMALL VORTICES. THE INITIAL
POSITION IS BASED ON THE LARGER-SCALE CIRCULATION SEEN IN RADAR
ANIMATIONS...AND CONTINUITY WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK. THE
INITIAL INTENSITY OF 45 KT IS BASED ON RECON SURFACE AND FLIGHT
LEVEL WINDS...AND DOPPLER VELOCITY DATA FROM THE BROWNSVILLE RADAR.

INITIAL MOTION IS 290/7. A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION IS EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT 36 HOURS...AND THE BROAD CENTER OF BERYL
SHOULD MOVE INLAND ALONG THE NORTHEAST COAST OF MEXICO IN THE NEXT 6
TO 12 HOURS. THE MAJORITY OF THE FORECAST MODELS AGREE ON A 
WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL.
 
THE STRONG BURSTS OF CONVECTION CAN LOCALLY SPINUP WINDS TO 50 OR 55
KT BEFORE MAKING LANDFALL. HOWEVER...IT IS UNLIKELY THAT BERYL WILL
REACH HURRICANE INTENSITY BEFORE LANDFALL. THE INTENSITY WAS HELD AT
45 KT IN 12 HOURS EVEN THOUGH BERYL WILL BE INLAND. THIS WAS DONE TO
ACCOUNT FOR THE LARGE BAND OF CONVECTION ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE
CIRCULATION WHICH COULD STILL BE OVER WATER AT THAT TIME. THE WIND
RADII WERE ALSO SHIFTED MORE TOWARD THE EAST SEMICIRCLE TO ACCOUNT
FOR LAND INTERACTION TO THE WEST.

THE DEPRESSION HAS NOT BECOME ANY BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE PAST
FEW HOURS.  THE CONVECTION IS WEAK AND CONFINED TO A FEW CLUSTERS
WHILE THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO FIND ON IR IMAGES.   IT IS HIGHLY
SURPRISING TO SEE THIS DEPRESSION NOT STRENGTHENING AT THIS TIME
SINCE THE OUTFLOW IS FAIR AND THE OCEAN IS WARM.  OBVIOUSLY THERE IS
MORE TO STRENGTHENING THAN THESE TWO FACTORS MENTIONED ABOVE.
HOWEVER... SINCE THESE TWO IMPORTANT PARAMETERS ARE EXPECTED TO
REMAIN FAVORABLE...THE DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO REACH TROPICAL
STORM STATUS.  THIS IS ALSO BASED ON SHIPS AND THE GFDL INTENSITY
GUIDANCE.
 
DURING THE CURRENT FORMATIVE STAGE...BOTH INITIAL POSITION AND
MOTION ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND THE CENTER MAY BE REFORMING A LITTLE
BIT TO THE NORTH WHERE THE CONVECTION IS DEVELOPING.  THE OVERALL
SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE MOVING TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST ABOUT 7 KNOTS.
GLOBAL MODELS FORECAST THAT THERE WILL BE ONLY A WEAK TO MODERATE
RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION.  CONSEQUENTLY...MOST OF THE
TRACK GUIDANCE KEEPS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ON A GENERAL SLOW
WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  ON THIS TRACK...MOST OF THE
WEATHER... WILL BE PASSING TO THE NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS IN
ABOUT 48 HOURS BUT ANY UNEXPECTED DEVIATION TO THE LEFT...COULD
BRING TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS TO SOME OF THE NORTHERNMOST ISLANDS.
 
AN AIR FORCE PLANE WILL CHECK THE DEPRESSION FRIDAY AFTERNOON.

A PERSISTENT CLUSTER OF CONVECTION HAS FORMED NEAR OR TO THE NORTH
OF THE HARD TO LOCATE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION SIX.  THE EXACT
LOCATION OF THE CENTER IS RATHER IMPORTANT...BECAUSE IF THE CENTER
IS NEAR THE CONVECTION THE SYSTEM IS MOVING MORE TO THE NORTHWEST
AND IS NEAR TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  THIS ADVISORY WILL KEEP THE
CENTER CLOSER TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK AND AT 30 KT INTENSITY.

THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/8.  A LOW/MID LEVEL
RIDGE IS PRESENT NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION...WHILE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
SHOWS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH ORIENTED NORTHEAST-SOUTHWEST TO THE
NORTHWEST OF THE CYCLONE.  THE RIDGE SHOULD KEEP THE DEPRESSION ON A
GENERALLY WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...AND NHC TRACK FORECAST GUIDANCE
AGREES WITH THIS.  ONE NOTE ABOUT THE GUIDANCE IS THAT THE
GFDL...WHICH WAS THE NORTHERNMOST MODEL 6 HR AGO...IS NOW THE
SOUTHERNMOST MODEL.  WITH THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE LOCATION...THERE IS
ONLY A SMALL NUDGING NORTHWARD OF THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

THE CYCLONE IS MOVING INTO AN AREA OF SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR...AND
LARGE-SCALE MODELS SUGGEST THIS SHOULD PERSIST FOR 24-48 HR BEFORE
DECREASING.  THIS SHEAR IS NOT STRONG...SO THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO
IS THAT IT WILL SLOW THE INTENSIFICATION.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST
GOES WITH THIS SCENARIO...CALLING FOR ONLY SLOW STRENGTHENING FOR
THE FIRST 24 HR AND A SLIGHTLY FASTER STRENGTHENING AFTER THAT.  
 
AN AIR FORCE PLANE WILL CHECK THE DEPRESSION THIS AFTERNOON. 
DEPENDING ON THE EXACT POSITION...COURSE...AND INTENSITY...WATCHES
OR WARNINGS MAY BE NECESSARY FOR PORTIONS OF THE LESSER ANTILLES
LATER TODAY.

11 AM EDT FRI AUG 18 2000
 
DEEP CONVECTION OVERNIGHT HAS WRAPPED AROUND THE SYSTEM CENTER...AND
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 35 KT WERE GIVEN BY TAFB...SAB...
AND KGWC. EVEN THOUGH CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS...THE INTENSITY HAS BEEN INCREASED TO 35 KT AND TROPICAL
DEPRESSION SIX IS NOW TROPICAL STORM CHRIS. OUTFLOW IS FAIR TO GOOD
TO THE NORTH...FAIR TO THE SOUTHEAST...AND POOR ELSEWHERE. AN AIR
FORCE RESERVE RECON AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN THE SYSTEM LATER THIS
AFTERNOON AND WILL GIVE US MORE ACCURATE POSITION AND INTENSITY
INFORMATION.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/11.  ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL MOTION HAS BEEN
TO THE NORTHWEST THE PAST 6 HOURS...OUR FEELING IS THAT THE
NORTHWARD JUMP IN THE CENTER POSITION IS DUE TO THE CONVECTIVE 
RE-ORGANIZATION. THERE IS GOOD CLUSTERING OF THE DYNAMIC MODELS
AROUND THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...WHILE THE STATISTICAL-BASED
MODELS HAVE A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK. THE GFDL HAS BEEN FLIP-
FLOPPING BACK AND FORTH EITHER SIDE OF THE PREVIOUS TRACKS...WHEREAS
THE UKMET HAS CONSISTENTLY KEPT THE SYSTEM WELL NORTH OF THE LEEWARD
AND PUERTO RICO. ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS AGREE ON BUILDING AT LEAST
A 592 DM 500 MB HIGH WESTWARD TO THE NORTHEAST OR NORTH OF CHRIS.
GIVEN THE SMALL SIZE OF THE CYCLONE...IT WILL NOT TAKE MUCH RIDGING
TO THE NORTH TO KEEP CHRIS MOVING ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK.
BY 72 HOURS...THE STRENGTH OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE IS UNCERTAIN.
THE GLOBAL MODELS WEAKEN THE 500 MB RIDGE...BUT KEEP THE SURFACE TO
700 MB RIDGE INTACT. THE RESULT MAY BE A DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED
MORE THAN WE ARE INDICATING AS THE STEERING FLOW WEAKENS.

ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT CHRIS WILL REMAIN UNDER AT
LEAST WEAK SOUTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL SHEAR THROUGH 48 TO 60 HOURS.
HOWEVER...THE MODELS ALSO AGREE THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW IN THE
NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE WILL ALSO ANTICYCLONICALLY CURVED AND WITH A 30
TO 40 KT OUTFLOW JET PRESENT TO THE NORTHEAST. AT THE LEAST...SOME
SLOW INTENSIFICATION SHOULD OCCUR AND THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL
TAKES CHRIS TO NEAR HURRICANE INTENSITY IN 72 HOURS. HOWEVER...IF
CHRIS SLOWS DOWN AFTER 48 HOURS AND ALLOWS THE 200 MB RIDGE AXIS TO
THE SOUTHEAST TO BUILD ACROSS THE SYSTEM...THEN MORE STRENGTHENING
COULD OCCUR THAN IS INDICATED BY THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

AIR FORCE RECON AIRCRAFT AND SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE CHRIS HAS
BECOME LESS ORGANIZED. RECON FOUND A VORTEX IN THE WESTERN PORTION
OF THE BROAD CIRCULATION...WHILE SATELLITE INDICATES A GOOD MID-
LEVEL CIRCULATION TO THE EAST. THE INITIAL POSITION IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN THE RECON AND SATELLITE POSITIONS. THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 35 KT...MAINLY IN SQUALLS. OUTFLOW IS FAIR IN ALL QUADRANTS
NOW AND IMPROVING.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/11...BUT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY
IN THE STORM MOTION DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE EXACT LOCATION OF
THE BROAD CENTER. HOWEVER...MOST OF THE MODELS INDICATE THAT THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTHEAST OF CHRIS WILL GRADUALLY BUILD
WESTWARD TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE. THE UKMET IS FARTHER NORTH
THAN ITS PREVIOUS RUNS...WHILE THE GFDL...GFDN...AND GFDU MODELS
KEEP CHRIS FARTHER SOUTH. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECASTS AND STILL NORTH OF THE LEEWARD
ISLANDS.  HOWEVER...IF THE CENTER OF CHRIS REFORMS FARTHER WEST...
THEN WATCHES AND/OR WARNINGS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THE NORTHERN
LEEWARD ISLANDS BY TOMORROW MORNING.

UNTIL THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER BECOMES BETTER DEFINED...LITTLE
INTENSIFICATION WILL OCCUR. BASED ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...IT
APPEARS THAT CHRIS HAS ENTRAINED SOME DRY AIR INTO THE EAST
SEMICIRCLE WHICH HAS DELAYED THE INTENSIFICATION PROCESS. HOWEVER...
IF CHRIS SLOWS DOWN THEN THE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS WILL BECOME MORE
FAVORABLE...AND THE TROPICAL CYCLONE COULD STRENGTHEN FASTER THAN
ANTICIPATED. IN FACT...THE SHIPS MODEL BRINGS CHRIS TO 69 KT IN 72
HOURS.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE.  SATELLITE POSITIONS ARE ABOUT 90
N MI NORTHEAST OF THE EARLIER AIRCRAFT 1500 FT FIXES...WHICH
SUGGESTS THAT THE SATELLITE CENTER IS A MID LEVEL ONE OR THAT THERE
IS MORE THAN ONE CENTER.  IN EITHER CASE...THE SYSTEM IS NOT WELL
DEFINED.  THE DEEP CONVECTION WAS COMPLETELY ABSENT UNTIL THE LAST
TWO HOURS WHEN A COUPLE OF SMALL BURSTS OCCURRED.  BECAUSE OF THE
ABOVE AND SINCE THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED MAXIMUM WINDS OF UNDER 25
KNOTS AND 1011 MB...CHRIS IS DOWNGRADED TO A DEPRESSION.  THE SHIPS
MODEL FORECASTS INTENSIFICATION OVER WARM SSTS TO 65 KNOTS IN 72
HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS EXCEPT 5 KNOTS LESS. 
ANOTHER AIRCRAFT RECON MISSION IS SCHEDULED FOR 12Z.

I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION...SO I
HAVE TRIED TO MAINTAIN SOME CONTINUITY WITH THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 
THE GUIDANCE MODELS ARE GENERALLY TOWARD THE NORTHWEST WITH SOME
ACCELERATION.  THE STEERING IS PROVIDED BY A RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF
THE SYSTEM AND A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE BETWEEN 70-80 WEST LONGITUDE.
THE GFDL AND EXPERIMENTAL FSU MODEL ARE TO THE LEFT OF THE OTHER

CHRIS REMAINS A POORLY ORGANIZED SYSTEM WITH A DIFFICULT TO LOCATE
CENTER.  SATELLITE FIXES FROM SAB AND TAFB WERE ABOUT 60 NM APART...
AND MULTISPECTRAL INFRARED IMAGERY HINTS THAT THE CENTER MAY BE
FARTHER WEST THAN EITHER FIX.  THE UNCERTAINTY MEANS THAT A GREAT
DEAL OF CONTINUITY AND EXTRAPOLATION WILL BE USED IN THIS PACKAGE.

THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/10.  A LARGE LOW/MID
LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS IN PLACE NORTH OF CHRIS...WHILE THE CYCLONE IS
MOVING INTO A BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE
THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH WILL WEAKEN SOMEWHAT WITH TIME...WHICH MAY
ALLOW CHRIS TO TURN MORE NORTHWARD.  MOST NHC TRACK GUIDANCE
REFLECTS THIS.  HOWEVER...IF THE CENTER IS FURTHER WEST...THE SYSTEM
WOULD BE WEST OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
COMPROMISES BETWEEN THE TWO POSSIBILITIES AND IS ALONG THE LEFT EDGE
OF THE GUIDANCE.

SOME CONVECTION IS PRESENT NORTH OR NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER...AND
THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 30 KT.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES
THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS CONTINUING TO CAUSE SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL
SHEAR.  LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THE SHEAR COULD CONTINUE FOR
24-48 HR.  THIS SHOULD AT LEAST SLOW INTENSIFICATION...AND THERE IS
SOME CHANCE CHRIS COULD DISSIPATE DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  TO
KEEP SOME CONTINUITY...THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL SLOW THE
PREVIOUSLY FORECAST INTENSIFICATION BY 12 HR.

AT 1500 FT AND FOUND ONLY SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW THROUGH THE ENTIRE

EXPECTED TO REMAIN OVER WATER TO THE NORTH OF THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS.

THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL WAVE WHICH HAS
BEEN TRACKED FOR SEVERAL DAYS ACROSS THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC HAS
DEVELOPED ENOUGH CIRCULATION AND SUFFICIENT ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO
BE CLASSIFIED AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  CREDIT IS GIVEN TO THE
GLOBAL MODELS...BOTH MRF AND UK...WHICH SYSTEMATICALLY HAVE BEEN
FORECASTING THIS DEVELOPMENT.  BASED ON SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS OF
2.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE FROM TAFB AND SAB AS WELL AS SHIP
OBSERVATIONS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 30 KNOTS.  THE
DEPRESSION HAS A LARGE  ENVELOPE...THERE IS NO SHEAR...THE OCEAN IS
WARM AND WITH THESE THREE PARAMETERS SO FAVORABLE...THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY FORECAST BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO HURRICANE STATUS IN 48
HOURS.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS SLOW COMPARED TO SHIPS...WHICH
BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO 90 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE CURRENT BROAD CIRCULATION
BECAUSE THE CENTER IS STILL IN ITS FORMATIVE STAGE.  BEST ESTIMATE
IS 280/15.  IT IS FORECAST THAT A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO NORTH OF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL PERSIST AND PERHAPS STRENGTHEN.  THIS WOULD
FAVOR A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK WITH SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED
DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS.  THIS FORECAST MOTION IS IN VERY GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL...THE UK...LBAR AND CLIMATOLOGY. AS
ANTICIPATED...BEYOND THREE DAYS...THE TRACK FORECAST BECOMES HIGHLY
UNCERTAIN BUT MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS INCLUDING THE ENSEMBLE BRING
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE EITHER TO THE SOUTHERN BAHAMAS OR JUST SOUTH OF
CUBA.

THE SYSTEM IS IN THE ORGANIZING PHASE.  EARLIER...THERE WAS
PRIMARILY A COLD CENTRAL OVERCAST FEATURE.  HOWEVER...RECENT
SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW BANDING FEATURES STARTING TO DEVELOP.  BECAUSE
OF THE GREAT UNCERTAINTY IN CENTER POSITION RELATIVE TO THE CLOUD
FEATURES...THE CYCLONE IS NOT BEING UPGRADED AT THIS TIME. 
HOWEVER...IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT WE WILL HAVE A NEW TROPICAL STORM
LATER TODAY.  UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED OVER
THE AREA...THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS WEAK...AND THE CYCLONE IS MOVING
OVER PROGRESSIVELY WARMER OCEAN WATERS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS
AN AREA OF SUBSIDENCE ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO THE WEST...BUT THIS
FEATURE IS MOVING WESTWARD IN TANDEM WITH THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THE
CURRENT INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ONE AND SHOWS
THE SYSTEM ATTAINING HURRICANE STATUS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

BECAUSE THE CENTER IS SO HARD TO FIND...INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION
ARE RATHER UNCERTAIN.  LATEST FIXES ARE A LITTLE NORTH OF THE
PREVIOUS TRACK.  I HAVE TRIED TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH THE
PREVIOUS TRACK FORECAST.  A DEEP-LAYER MEAN RIDGE IS FORECAST TO THE

CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION IS PREDICTED.  THE CURRENT

NEARLY THE CONSENSUS OF THE GFDL...U.K. MET. OFFICE AND NOGAPS
SOLUTIONS.  THE LATEST AVN FORECAST IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR TO THIS

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT SUN AUG 20 2000

TROPICAL DEPRESSION SEVEN HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED
THIS MORNING WITH IMPROVED BANDING FEATURES AND INCREASED DEEP
CONVECTION NEAR THE SYSTEM CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF
45 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB JUSTIFY INCREASING THE INITIAL
INTENSITY TO 40 KT AND MAKING THE SYSTEM TROPICAL STORM DEBBY.
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS GOOD IN ALL QUADRANTS AND IMPROVING.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 295/16.  THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE SYSTEM CENTER
HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE DUE TO CONVECTIVE REORGANIZATION...
BUT IT SHOULD BE NEAR OR TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE SMALL CENTRAL DENSE
OVERCAST. THE MAJORITY OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE KEEPS DEBBY ON A
GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL...UKMET AND THE EXPERIMENTAL FSU
SUPERENSEMBLE MODELS...AND SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACK.  THE GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE THIS GENERAL MOTION BEYOND THE
FORECAST PERIOD.

DEBBY IS EXPECTED TO STEADILY INTENSIFY THROUGH 36 HOURS AND SHOULD
REACH HURRICANE INTENSITY.  THEREAFTER...SOME SHEAR MAY SLOW DOWN
THE INTENSIFICATION RATE AS SUGGESTED BY THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL.
 
A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE REQUIRED FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN
LEEWARD ISLANDS LATER TODAY OR TONIGHT.

THE CONVECTIVE BANDING OF TROPICAL STORM DEBBY HAS BECOME A LITTLE
BETTER ORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON...WHILE THE CENTER POSITION IS STILL
SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN.  A 1506Z TRMM OVERPASS SHOWED A TIGHT MID-LEVEL
CIRCULATION OR EYE-LIKE FEATURE IN THE 85GHZ ICE DATA...WHILE THE
37GHZ CHANNEL AND VISIBLE SATELLITE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION IS LOCATED ABOUT 25 NM TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE MID-
LEVEL CIRCULATION.  ALTHOUGH SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 45 KT
ARE INDICATED BY TAFB AND SAB...I FELT IT BEST TO HOLD THE INTENSITY
DOWN SOME UNTIL THE LOW-LEVEL AND MID-LEVEL CIRCULATIONS BECOME
VERTICALLY STACKED. OUTFLOW REMAINS GOOD IN ALL QUADRANTS.

INITIAL MOTION IS 290/17.  DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE LOCATION OF
THE SYSTEM CENTER...THERE MAY BE SOME LARGE WOBBLES ALONG THE TRACK.
THE OVERALL WIND AND CONVECTIVE ENVELOPE HAS BEEN TRACKING WESTWARD
TODAY...WHILE THE SYSTEM CENTER HAS BEEN REFORMING AND WOBBLING
AROUND INSIDE THE ENVELOPE.  DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE EXACT
LOCATION OF THE CENTER...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY NEAR THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK.  ALL OF THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL MODELS
AGREE ON BUILDING THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST OF
DEBBY THROUGH THE PERIOD...WHICH SHOULD ACT TO KEEP THE CYCLONE ON A
GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK.  THIS SEEMS REASONABLE BASED ON 590 DM
HEIGHTS AND EAST WINDS IN THE 12Z RAOB DATA OVER THE NORTHEAST
CARIBBEAN ISLANDS.  ALSO...RECENT SYNOPTIC DROPSONDE DATA FROM THE
GULFSTREAM JET AIRCRAFT INDICATED A DEEP LAYER MEAN STEERING FLOW
FROM THE EAST AT 15 TO 20 KT NORTH OF DEBBY.  THIS NEW DATA WILL BE
INCORPORATED INTO THE 00Z MODEL RUNS...AND A TRACK CLOSER TO THE
NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK
ON THE EXTREME SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE ENVELOPE AND
CLOSE TO BUT A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE GFDL AND UKMET MODELS.

DEBBY IS EXPECTED TO STEADILY INTENSIFY THROUGH 36 HOURS AND REACH
HURRICANE INTENSITY IN 36 TO 48 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...SOME SHEAR MAY
SLOW DOWN THE INTENSIFICATION RATE AS SUGGESTED BY THE SHIPS
INTENSITY MODEL.

...CORRECTION...CHANGE WINDWARD TO LEEWARD ISLANDS...

ONCE AGAIN THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE.  A RECENT SSM/I IMAGE
INDICATES A POORLY ORGANIZED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION.  HOWVER THE CDO
FEATURE IS LARGE...COLD...AND SYMMETRIC AND SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES RANGE FROM 45 TO 55 KNOTS.  THE INITIAL OFFICIAL INTENSITY
IS 45 KNOTS BASED ON THE POOR LOW LEVEL ORGAINIZATION.  THE SHIPS
MODEL CALLS FOR STRENGTHENING TO 80 KNOTS IN 72 HOURS WITH WARM SSTS
AND ONLY SLIGHTLY LIMITING VERTICAL SHEAR.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
DOES LIKEWISE...ALTHOUGH THE STORM IS GOING TO HAVE TO BECOME BETTER
ORGANIZED FOR THIS FORECAST TO VERIFY.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/16.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS
ARE ALL CLUSTERED CLOSELY TOGETHER AROUND A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK AT 15 KNOTS OR A LITTLE HIGHER.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
BASED ON THIS AND IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
EXCEPT FOR ADVANCING EVERYTHING SIX HOURS.  

THE FORECAST TRACK CALLS FOR WATCHES THROUGHOUT THE LEEWARD ISLANDS
FROM NORTH OF DOMINICA THROUGH THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND THE
GOVERNMENTS OF ANTIGUA...THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES AND GUADELOUPE
HAVE BEEN COORDINATED WITH.

THE CENTER OF DEBBY IS STILL HARD TO LOCATE.  RECENT SATELLITE FIXES
NUDGE THE SYSTEM A LITTLE FURTHER WEST THAN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...
AND NIGHTTIME MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY HINTS THAT IT MIGHT EVEN BE
SOUTH OF 15N.  IN VIEW OF THIS UNCERTAINTY...THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS A
LOT OF CONTINUITY AND EXTRAPOLATION.  SOME RE-LOCATION MAY BE
NECESSARY IN THE NEXT PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 285/16.  A STRONG LOW/MID
LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF DEBBY SHOULD KEEP IT ON A GENERAL WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  BY 72 HR...THE RIDGE
MAY WEAKEN AS THE PERSISTENT DEEP LAYER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
RE-INTENSIFIES.  HOWEVER...ANY MAJOR CHANGE THIS MIGHT CAUSE IN THE
TRACK OF DEBBY WILL LIKELY OCCUR AFTER THIS FORECAST PERIOD.  NHC
TRACK GUIDANCE AGREES ON THE WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...AND THE ONLY
CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A SLIGHT SOUTHWARD NUDGING.

WHILE SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 55 KT...55 KT...AND 45 KT
FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA...THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 45 KT
DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN WHERE THE CENTER IS.  DEBBY HAS THE
SATELLITE SIGNATURE OF A SHEARED SYSTEM...AND THE SATELLITE WIND
SHEAR PRODUCT FROM CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN INDICATES
ABOUT 10 KT SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM.  THE SHIPS MODEL
AND SOME LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGEST THAT SOME AMOUNT OF SHEAR
COULD CONTINUE...WHICH WOULD KEEP THE RATE OF INTENSIFICATION DOWN.
THE INTENSITY FORECAST FOLLOWS THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  NOTE THAT SOME
ADJUSTMENT OF THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS POSSIBLE AFTER AN AIR FORCE
RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER ARRIVES AT 12Z.

THE EXACT CENTER OF DEBBY REMAINS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE. AIR FORCE
RESERVE RECON AIRCRAFT HAS HAD A HARD TIME CLOSING OFF A WELL-
DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION...AND SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THE
CENTER REMAINS SHEARED TO THE SOUTHWEST OR WEST OF THE DEEPEST
CONVECTION.  HOWEVER...RECON ALSO FOUND 88 KT WINDS AT 1000 FT IN
THE CONVECTION TO THE NORTH OF THE APPARENT CENTER.   BASED ON THE
SEVERAL WIND REPORTS OF 80 TO 88 KT...THE INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN
INCREASED TO 60 KT.  WE HAVE KEPT DEBBY JUST BELOW MINIMAL HURRICANE
INTENSITY DUE TO THE ILL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CENTER.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 275/19.  THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE
TO THE NORTH REMAINS STRONG AND SHOULD KEEP DEBBY ON A GENERAL WEST
OR SLIGHTLY WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH THE PERIOD.  MOST OF THE
GLOBAL MODELS MAINTAIN A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE OFF THE SOUTHEAST
U.S. AND OVER THE BAHAMAS WHICH MAY ACT TO DECREASE THE FORWARD
SPEED AND ALLOW FOR SOME POLEWARD MOTION TO OCCUR AFTER 48 HOURS. 
THE OFFICIAL TRACK TAKES DEBBY ACROSS PUERTO RICO AND OVER THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC IN 24 TO 48 HOURS...AND SOUTH OF ANDROS ISLAND IN
72 HOURS.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...AND
BETWEEN THE GFDL AND THE UKMET MODELS.  NOTE...THE MOUNTAINOUS
TERRAIN OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC MAY CREATE SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
THE TRACK AND IF DEBBY TRACKS SOUTH OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGE OF
HISPANIOLA...THEN A MORE WESTWARD TRACK TOWARD CUBA IS POSSIBLE IN
72 HOURS.

SLOW AND STEADY INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST THROUGH THE PERIOD.  
HOWEVER...BASED ON THE IMPRESSIVE WIND AND CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION
OF DEBBY...IF THE SYSTEM SLOWS JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THE LOW-LEVEL
AND MID-LEVEL CIRCULATIONS TO BECOME VERTICALLY STACKED...THEN WE
COULD BE DEALING WITH A STRONGER AND RAPIDLY INTENSIFYING SYSTEM AS
IT MOVES THROUGH THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

DEBBY REMAINS A SHEARED SYSTEM...MAINLY DUE TO THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION MOVING FASTER THAN THE MID- AND UPPER-LEVEL
CIRCULATIONS.  AIR FORCE RESERVE RECON FOUND LITTLE CHANGE IN THE
1500 FT WINDS THIS AFTERNOON...SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT
60 KT.  OUTFLOW IS GOOD IN THE NORTH SEMICIRCLE AND RESTRICTED
ELSEWHERE.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 280/19.  THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER
CONTINUES TO REDEVELOP NEAR EACH CONVECTIVE BURST IN THE NORTHEAST
QUADRANT AND THEN MOVES OUT TO THE WEST...SO WE BASICALLY WENT WITH
MIDDLE OF THE CIRCULATION ENVELOPE AND JUST NORTH OF THE RECON
FIXES.  THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH REMAINS INTACT AND SHOULD
HELP TO KEEP DEBBY ON A GENERAL WEST OR SLIGHTLY WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK THROUGH THE PERIOD.  THE GLOBAL MODELS MAINTAIN A WEAKNESS IN
THE RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. AND THE BAHAMAS...WHICH SHOULD
SLOW DOWN DEBBY AND ALLOW A GRADUAL TURN MORE TOWARD THE WEST-
NORTHWEST.  THE UKMET MODEL TAKES DEBBY MORE POLEWARD THROUGH THE
BAHAMAS AFTER 48 HOURS...BUT THIS IS THE ONLY MODEL THAT DOES THAT.
THE GFDL MODEL HAS BEEN FLIP-FLOPPING BACK AND FORTH EITHER SIDE OF
OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACKS...SO THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE
PREVIOUS FORECASTS AND JUST SOUTH OF THE GFDL AND A LITTLE NORTH OF
THE AVIATION/AVN MODEL.
 
SLOW AND STEADY INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST THROUGH THE PERIOD.
HOWEVER...IF DEBBY SLOWS JUST A FEW KNOTS...THEN THE LOW-LEVEL
AND MID-LEVEL CIRCULATIONS WOULD BECOME VERTICALLY STACKED...MAKING
DEBBY MUCH STRONGER THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS INDICATING. THE
INITIAL WIND RADII WERE INCREASED BASED ON RECON AND 18Z WIND
REPORTS...WHILE THE 12 FT SEAS RADII WERE UNCHANGED.

THE FIRST 24 HOURS OF THE FORECAST TRACK NORTHWARD BY ABOUT 30 N

HURRICANE DEBBY DISCUSSION NUMBER  11
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT TUE AUG 22 2000
 
DEBBY HAS STRENGTHENED INTO A 65 KT HURRICANE DURING THE NIGHT BASED
ON DROPSONDE MEASUREMENTS OF HURRICANE FORCE SURFACE WINDS.  AN
EARLIER SHARP DROP IN CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY A
SUPERCELL-TYPE THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPING NEAR THE CENTER.  THIS
TIGHTLY-WOUND FEATURE QUICKLY DISSIPATED AND THE CENTRAL PRESSURE
ROSE FROM 991 MB TO 994 MB.  SINCE THEN...THE GUADELOUPE RADAR HAS
SHOWN THE FORMATION OF A MORE CLASSIC BANDING PATTERN.

AIRCRAFT AND RADAR DATA SUGGEST A SLIGHT TURN TO THE RIGHT AND THE
INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 290/18.  THE REASON FOR THIS MIGHT BE THE
SOUTHERLY UPPER LEVEL FLOW BLOWING ACROSS THE NOW DEEPER VORTEX.
THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE SYNOPTIC REASONING...AS LOW/MID LEVEL
RIDGING SHOULD KEEP DEBBY ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK
THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  DESPITE THIS...SOME DIFFERENCES HAVE
DEVELOPED IN THE MODELS.  THE NOGAPS AND AVN TAKE DEBBY ON A MORE
WESTERLY COURSE OVER HISPANIOLA AND CUBA INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO.
THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY THE BAMS AND THE NHC90.  THE UKMET CALLS FOR A
MORE NORTHERLY MOTION...TAKING DEBBY THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN
BAHAMAS.  IT IS SUPPORTED BY LBAR AND VICBAR.  THE GFDL AND GFDN ARE
DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE SUITE...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
AGREES BEST WITH THE GFDN.  THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF A STAIR-STEP
TRACK...A MORE NORTHWARD MOTION NOW FOLLOWED BY A MORE WESTWARD
MOTION LATER.  THIS IS SUPPORTED BY WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...WHICH
INDICATES A SHORTWAVE TROUGH BETWEEN THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. AND
BERMUDA...AND LARGE-SCALE MODEL FORECAST OF HEIGHT RISES OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC AFTER 24-36 HR.

THE CONTINUED RAPID MOTION IS KEEPING ABOUT 10 KT OF SHEAR OVER
DEBBY...WHICH IS SLOWING INTENSIFICATION.  THIS IS LIKELY TO
CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT 24-36 HR...SO EARLY IN THE PERIOD FURTHER
STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY TO BE SLOW AND UNSTEADY.  AS THE STORM
SLOWS...CONDITIONS MAY BE MORE FAVORABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT IF DEBBY IS
NOT OVER HISPANIOLA OR IS NOT UNDER THE 200 MB NORTHWEST FLOW
FORECAST OVER PORTIONS OF THE WESTERN ATLANTIC BY 72 HR.  IF THESE
EXTREMES DO NOT OCCUR...DEBBY MAY BE STRONGER THAN CURRENTLY
FORECAST BY 72 HR.

AN EYE FEATURE HAS CONTINUED TO SPIN UP AND SPIN DOWN IN ABOUT 3
HOURS INCREMENTS OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS...AND RECON AND RADAR DATA
INDICATE THAT DEBBY MAY BE WRAPPING UP AN EYE AGAIN.  OUTFLOW HAS
IMPROVED DURING THE PAST 12 HOURS AND THE OVERALL CONVECTIVE PATTERN
HAS BECOME MORE CIRCULAR.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/19.  HOWEVER...RECENT RECON AND RADAR
REPORTS SUGGEST THAT DEBBY MAY BE MAKING ANOTHER WOBBLE TO THE WEST
AND IS CURRENTLY PASSING OVER THE VIRGIN ISLANDS...AND THE SOUTHERN
EYEWALL MAY JUST SKIRT THE NORTHEAST COAST OF PUERTO RICO THIS
AFTERNOON.  IN THE LONGER TERM...MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE HAS
SHIFTED A LITTLE MORE POLEWARD WITH THE UKMET MODEL SLOWLY TRACKING
DEBBY NORTHWARD THROUGH THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS IN 48 TO 72 HOURS.   ALL
OF THE GLOBAL MODELS MAINTAIN A WEAKNESS IN THE 500 MB RIDGE AXIS
OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. AND BAHAMAS...BUT THE UKMET DIGS THE
NORTHERN U.S. TROUGH FURTHER SOUTH THAN ANY OF THE OTHER MODELS. 
HOWEVER...EVEN THE UKMET MODEL MAINTAINS THE SURFACE TO 700 MB RIDGE
TO THE NORTH OF DEBBY THROUGH 72 HOURS.  AS A RESULT...THE OFFICIAL
TRACK MERELY SLOWS THE FORWARD SPEED DOWN TO 8 KT IN 72 HOURS RATHER
THAN RECURVING THE CYCLONE TO THE NORTH.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS JUST
NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE GFDL MODEL.
  
THE RAPID MOTION OF DEBBY SHOULD KEEP ANY SIGNIFICANT
INTENSIFICATION FROM OCCURRING FOR PROBABLY THE NEXT 24 HOURS...
AND IN 36 HOURS...SOME SOUTHERLY DOWNSLOPE FLOW OFF HISPANIOLA MAY
HINDER THE INTENSIFICATION PROCESS.  HOWEVER...BY THE 48 AND 72 HOUR
PERIODS...DEBBY SHOULD BE CLEAR OF ANY LAND EFFECTS AND BE OVER 29C
OR HIGHER SSTS. THE WARM WATER AND IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW PATTERN WOULD
TEND TO FAVOR SIGNIFICANT INTENSIFICATION AND DEBBY COULD POSSIBLY
BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE AT THAT TIME.  IN FACT...THE GFDL MODEL
TAKES DEBBY DOWN TO 937 MB IN 72 HOURS.  WE ARE FOLLOWING THE SHIPS
INTENSITY MODEL...WHICH HAS PERFORMED WELL...UNTIL THE INNER CORE OF
DEBBY BECOMES BETTER ORGANIZED.  FORECAST INTENSITIES MAY BE
ADJUSTED HIGHER IN THE AFTERNOON FORECAST.

A RAGGED 25NM DIAMETER EYE HAS APPEARED IN THE SAN JUAN RADAR DATA
THIS AFTERNOON...AND SEVERAL CONVECTIVE BURSTS HAVE SPUN UP SMALL
EYEWALL MESOVORTICES WHICH HAVE DISTORTED THE OVERALL SHAPE OF THE
EYE.  THIS HAS MADE IT A DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN THE EXACT POSITION
OF THE CENTER OF DEBBY.  SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGES INDICATE THE
INNER CORE CONVECTIVE PATTERN CONTINUES TO IMPROVE...WHILE THE
OUTFLOW REMAINS IMPRESSIVE IN THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/18.  DEBBY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE
TRACKING WEST-NORTHWEST TO THE NORTH OF PUERTO RICO AND HISPANIOLA
TONIGHT.  ALL OF THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL MODELS MAINTAIN THE RIDGE
AXIS FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS SOUTHEAST TO THE CAROLINAS AND TO
NORTHEAST OF DEBBY.  ALL THE MODELS ALSO AGREE ON MAINTAINING A

MODEL.  THERE IS ALSO LESS DIVERGENCE AMONG THE OTHER FORECAST
MODELS WHICH ARE NOW CONVERGING ON OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK.

THE RAPID MOTION OF DEBBY SHOULD CONTINUE TO PREVENT ANY SIGNIFICANT 
INTENSIFICATION FROM OCCURRING FOR PROBABLY THE NEXT 24 HOURS. IN 36
HOURS...SOME SOUTHERLY DOWNSLOPE FLOW OFF HISPANIOLA MAY ALSO HINDER
THE INTENSIFICATION PROCESS.  HOWEVER...AFTER 48 HOURS...DEBBY WILL
BE CLEAR OF ANY LAND EFFECTS AND BE OVER VERY WARM WATER.  WITH THE
IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW PATTERN TO THE NORTH AND THE DEEP UPEPR-LEVEL
TROUGH TO THE EAST ACTING AS A MASS SINK...SIGNIFICANT
INTENSIFICATION COULD OCCUR AND DEBBY COULD POSSIBLY BECOME A MAJOR
HURRICANE IN 48 TO 72 HOURS.  IN FACT...THE NEW GFDL MODEL RUN TAKES
DEBBY DOWN TO AROUND 935 MB IN 72 HOURS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT TUE AUG 22 2000

DEBBY HAS NOT STRENGTHENED AS ANTICIPATED BASED ON CENTRAL PRESSURE
AND WIND REPORTS FROM THE VARIOUS RECONNAISSANCE PLANES THAT HAVE
BEEN IN DEBBY DURING THE PAST 12 TO 18 HOURS.  THERE ARE ONLY A FEW
SPOTS OF HURRICANE FORCE WINDS AND THE MINIMUM PRESSURE IS 998
MB...A VALUE WHICH...ON AVERAGE IS HIGH FOR A HURRICANE.  ALTHOUGH
THE OUTFLOW APPEARS TO BE EXPANDING WESTWARD...THERE ARE SOME UPPER-
LEVEL SOUTHERLY WINDS DISRUPTING THE CLOUD PATTERN. AS LONG AS THIS
SHEAR PERSISTS...NO RAPID INTENSIFICATION IS ANTICIPATED. IN
ADDITION...DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS...DEBBY WILL BE MOVING
NORTH OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC...AND THE HIGH MOUNTAINS WILL
PROBABLY CUT THE INFLOW FROM THE SOUTH.  INTENSITY GUIDANCE CALLS
FOR INTENSIFICATION AND BOTH GFDL AND THE COUPLED GFDL MAKE DEBBY A
VERY STRONG HURRICANE BY 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST
CALLS FOR NO CHANGE DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS WHILE DEBBY IS MOVING
NORTH OF HISPANIOLA WITH A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING THEREAFTER. 
 
DATA FROM SEVERAL DROPWINDSONDES RELEASED THIS EVENING INDICATE THAT
A 500 MB HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS WESTWARD FROM THE SOUTHEAST
UNITED STATES TO NORTH OF DEBBY AND THAT A MID-LEVEL TROUGH IS 
MOVING BY TO THE NORTH OF DEBBY.  PERHAPS...THIS IS THE REASON WHY
DEBBY HAS BEEN MOVING MORE TO THE WEST DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS. 
HOWEVER...MOST OF THE MODELS AGREE THAT THIS RIDGE WILL WEAKEN AND
DEBBY WILL RESUME ITS WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK WITH A DECREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED.   ON THIS TRACK...DEBBY WILL BE VERY CLOSE TO THE
SOUTHEAST FLORIDA COAST IN 72 HOURS.  THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE
GFDL..UK AND THE FSU EXPERIMENTAL SUPERENSEMBLE.  

DEBBY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A DANGEROUS HURRICANE AS IT
APPROACHES THE SOUTHEAST FLORIDA COAST.

HURRICANE DEBBY DISCUSSION NUMBER  15
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT WED AUG 23 2000
 
DEBBY HAS AGAIN SHOWN LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH OVER THE PAST 6 HR.
AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT FOUND A MINIMUM
PRESSURE OF 995 MB AND 74 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS NORTHEAST OF THE
CENTER.  ON THIS BASIS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 65 KT. 
WSR-88D DATA FROM SAN JUAN INDICATE A SERIES OF EYEWALL MESOVORTICES
HAVE FORMED AND THEN DISSIPATED DURING THE NIGHT...AS THE EYEWALL
CONVECTION HAS HAD TROUBLE WRAPPING MORE THAN HALFWAY AROUND THE
CENTER.  ONE NOTABLE ASPECT IS THAT A DROPSONDE IN THE EYE INDICATES
THE SURFACE CENTER MAY BE WEST OF THE 700 MB CENTER.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14.  A TWO-AIRCRAFT SYNOPTIC FLOW MISSION
TONIGHT RELEASED NUMEROUS DROPSONDES OVER THE CARIBBEAN AND WESTERN
ATLANTIC.  THESE SHOWED THAT DEBBY IS SOUTH OF A DEEP LAYER RIDGE...
AND IS ALREADY PASSING WEST OF THE WEAKNESS CAUSED BY A SHORTWAVE
TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY NEAR BERMUDA.  THE RIDGE SHOULD
KEEP DEBBY ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 48 HR.  THE
DROPSONDES HAVE CAUSED INTERESTING CHANGES IN THE MODELS.  ALL
LARGE-SCALE MODELS NOW CALL FOR A MORE WESTERLY MOTION ALONG THE
NORTH COASTS OF HISPANIOLA AND CUBA INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO.  THIS
INCLUDES THE UKMET...WHICH 12 HR AGO WAS MOVING DEBBY NORTHWARD EAST
OF FLORIDA.  IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH WILL
AMPLIFY SOUTHWARD BY 48 TO 72 HR.  THE QUESTION IS WILL DEBBY BE
CLOSE ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO IT?  THREE MODELS THAT SAY YES ARE LBAR
AND VICBAR...WHICH KEEP DEBBY EAST OF FLORIDA...AND THE GFDL...WHICH
TAKES IT TO NEAR THE FLORIDA KEYS.  IN VIEW OF THE SIZE OF THE
CHANGES...THERE WILL BE ONLY A SLIGHT SOUTHWARD ADJUSTMENT OF THE
FORECAST TRACK AT THIS TIME.  A MORE SUBSTANTIAL ADJUSTMENT CAN WAIT
UNTIL THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE OF WESTWARD MOTION AND MORE CONSISTENCY
IN THE MODEL RUNS.

THE DROPSONDE DATA INDICATES 10-20 KT SOUTHERLY FLOW AT 200-300 MB
UNDERCUTTING THE OUTFLOW OF DEBBY.  THIS HAS HELPED INHIBIT
INTENSIFICATION.  A COMBINATION OF SHEAR AND PROXIMITY TO HISPANIOLA
SHOULD PREVENT SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING FOR THE 24 HR OR SO.  AFTER
THAT...THE SHEAR MAY DECREASE AND ALLOW INTENSIFICATION.  THE SHIPS
MODEL...WHICH HAS PERFORMED WELL SO FAR...NOW TAKES DEBBY TO 81 KT
BY 72 HR.  AN EXTREME OUTLIER IS THE GFDL...WHICH HAS A 926 MB
PRESSURE AS DEBBY REACHES THE FLORIDA KEYS.  THIS LOOKS SUSPECT...AS
IT IS ALREADY STRONGER THAN REALITY AND A LOT OF DEEPENING OCCURS AS
THE MODEL STORM MOVES ALONG THE COASTS OF HISPANIOLA AND CUBA. 
NEVERTHELESS...DEBBY COULD BE A DANGEROUS MAJOR HURRICANE AS IT
APPROACHES SOUTH FLORIDA.

AIR FORCE RECON FOUND A TIGHT MID-LEVEL CIRCULATION THIS MORNING
WITH MOST OF THE CONVECTION DISPLACED TO THE NORTHEAST. THE LOW-
LEVEL CIRCULATION HAS LIKELY BEEN DISRUPTED BY THE DOWNSLOPE FLOW
OFF THE MOUNTAINS OF HISPANIOLA. UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW REMAINS
IMPRESSIVE IN THE NORTH SEMICIRCLE...BUT IS RESTRICTED ELSEWHERE DUE
TO SOUTHERLY SHEAR. THE INITIAL INTENSITY WAS DECREASED TO 60 KT
BASED ON SEVERAL RECON DROPSONDES INDICATING 55 TO 60 KT WIND NORTH
OF THE CENTER IN THE WEAKENING CONVECTION AROUND 12Z.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/14.  CENTER LOCATIONS FROM RECON
INDICATE CONSIDERABLE FLUCTUATION IN THE FORWARD SPEED RANGING FROM
19 KT DOWN TO 12 KT.  AS A RESULT...THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
BASED ON CONTINUITY AND PERSISTENCE.  AFTER THE UKMET MODEL MADE A
HUGE CHANGE IN THE TRACK OF DEBBY BETWEEN THE 22/12Z AND 23/00Z
RUNS...I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE SPECIFICS OF ITS FORECAST
TRACK.  THE UKMET INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A WEAK SYSTEM...WHICH
SUGGESTS THAT THE MODEL IS BASING THE STEERING MAINLY ON THE LOW-
LEVEL FLOW.  THE NOGAPS MODEL SEEMS TO BE KEYING ON THE SAME TYPE OF
STEERING REGIME.  HOWEVER...THE AVN AND MRF MODELS HAVE BEEN VERY
CONSISTENT WITH A TRACK NEAR THE NORTH COAST OF HISPANIOLA AND
CUBA...AND HAS GRADUALLY BEEN SHIFTING THE TRACK NORTHWARD.  THOSE
MODELS ALSO MADE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TRACK CHANGE AS COMPARED TO THE
OTHER 23/00Z GLOBAL MODELS.  AS A RESULT...WE HAVE STAYED CLOSE TO
THE GFDL MODEL WHICH TAKES DEBBY CLOSE TO THE SOUTHERN TIP OF
FLORIDA IN 72 HOURS.  ALSO...THE NEW FORECAST MODEL GUIDANCE IS LESS
DIVERGENT THAN PREVIOUS RUNS...AND NOW CONVERGE MORE ON A TRACK
TOWARD SOUTH FLORIDA OR THE FLORIDA KEYS...EXCLUDING THE UKMET AND
NOGAPS WHICH KEEP DEBBY MAINLY TO THE SOUTH OF CUBA.

THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST
REASONING.  LAND INTERACTION SHOULD HINDER ANY SIGNIFICANT
DEVELOPMENT FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  AS DEBBY MOVES NORTH OF
THE WINDWARD PASSAGE...INCREASED SOUTHERLY INFLOW MAY ALLOW FOR SOME
WEAK INTENSIFICATION BEFORE THE FLOW COMES OFF OF CUBA AGAIN.  BY 48
HOURS...DEBBY IS FORECAST TO BE FREE OF ANY ADVERSE LAND EFFECTS AND
ALSO BE OVER 29C TO 30C WATER.  ALL THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL MODELS
AGREE THAT A 200 MB LOW WILL CLOSE OFF NEAR THE YUCATAN...WHICH
WOULD SHIFT THE SHEAR VECTOR AROUND FROM THE SOUTH-SOUTHWEST TO THE
SOUTHEAST...WHICH WOULD BE ALONG AND WITH THE STORM MOTION RATHER
THAN ACROSS IT.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL ALSO INDICATES DECREASING
SHEAR AFTER 48 HOURS...AND THE INTENSITY COULD BE HIGHER THAN WE ARE
INDICATING IF DEBBY EVER MAINTAINS A GOOD CLOSED EYE/LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION.

RECON AND SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE LOW- AND MID-LEVEL
CIRCULATIONS HAVE SEPARATED FROM THE UPPER-LEVEL CIRCULATION DURING
THE DAY. SOME CONVECTION HAS RE-DEVELOPED NEAR THE RAGGED LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION...BUT MOST OF THE SIGNIFICANT DEEP CONVECTION REMAINS
SHEARED WELL TO THE EAST WHERE THE BEST UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS
LOCATED. THE INITIAL INTENSITY WAS DECREASED BASED ON 50 KT RECON
WINDS AT 1000 FT.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 275/16.  THE MAIN QUESTION IS WHICH
SIDE OF EASTERN CUBA WILL DEBBY TAKE ONCE THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER
EMERGES OFF THE NORTHWEST COAST OF HAITI LATER TONIGHT.  OUR FEELING
IS THAT INCREASING SOUTHERLY FLOW THROUGH THE WINDWARD PASSAGE MAY
HELP TO NUDGE THE CENTER NORTH OF 20N LATITUDE AND KEEP IT ON THE
NORTH COAST OF CUBA. HOWEVER...IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER COULD SNEAK THROUGH THE PASSAGE AND EMERGE ON THE SOUTH SIDE
OF CUBA.  ASSUMING DEBBY STAYS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HIGHER
TERRAIN...THE TRACK KEEPS DEBBY JUST INLAND ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF
CUBA THROUGH 36 HOURS...WHICH IS CLOSE TO GFDL...AND THE MEDIUM AND
DEEP BAM MODELS.  THE NEW 12Z UKMET MODEL HAS SHIFTED ITS TRACK
FURTHER NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS 00Z TRACK.  UNTIL SOME CONSISTENCY IN
THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL MODELS OCCURS...WE DO NOT WANT TO SHIFT THE
TRACK TOO FAR TO THE WEST AND TAKE SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS OFF
THE HOOK. THE REASON IS THAT ALL THE MODELS AGREE ON DEVELOPING A
STRONG WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE ACROSS FLORIDA AND THE
SOUTHEAST AFTER 48 HOURS. NOTE...THE G-IV AIRCRAFT WILL BE MAKING A
SYNOPTIC FLIGHT AROUND DEBBY TONIGHT...AND THAT DROPSONDE DATA
SHOULD MAKE IT INTO THE 00Z MODEL RUNS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE TRACK FORECAST. IF
DEBBY STAYS OVER LAND AS FORECAST...THEN WEAKENING SHOULD CONTINUE.
HOWEVER...IF MORE OF THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION STAYS OVER WATER...
SOME SLOW STRENGTHENING COULD STILL OCCUR BEYOND 48 HOURS.  THE
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL ALSO BE MORE FAVORABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT THEN
DUE TO DECREASING VERTICAL SHEAR...AS INDICATED BY ALL THE MODELS.

DEBBY WAS HARD HIT BY SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR AND THE HIGH
MOUNTAINS OF HISPANIOLA.   SATELLITE IMAGES DEPICT A VERY ILL-
DEFINED LOW CLOUD CENTER WITH ONLY A FEW CELLS OF DEEP CONVECTION.
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OF ABOUT 1008
MB OVER THE WINDWARD PASSAGE.  A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE IS EN ROUTE TO
DETERMINE IF A CLOSED CIRCULATION STILL EXITS. 

BASED ON EARLIER RECON REPORTS OF 50 KNOTS AT FLIGHT LEVEL TO THE
NORTH OF THE ESTIMATED CENTER...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS 40 KNOTS AT
THIS TIME.  DEBBY...OR ITS REMNANTS...SHOULD SPREAD OVER THE HIGH
TERRAIN OF EASTERN CUBA DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS.  THEREFORE DEBBY
IS FORECAST TO BECOME A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  IF THE CENTER
SURVIVES...AND MOVES WESTWARD OVER THE WARM WATERS SOUTH OF
CUBA...AND DECREASES IN FORWARD SPEED...IT COULD REGAIN TROPICAL
STORM INTENSITY BY 36 HOURS AS THE SHEAR DECREASES.  INTENSITY
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO SHOW STRENGTHENING.  HOWEVER...SO FAR NONE OF
THE NUMERICAL MODELS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE A REALISTIC INTENSITY
FORECAST FOR DEBBY. 

THE TROPICAL STORM HAS BECOME A SHALLOW SYSTEM AND IS BEING STEERED
BY THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW.  GLOBAL MODELS KEEP A STRONG HIGH PRESSURE
SYSTEM TO THE NORTH OF DEBBY AND THIS PATTERN WOULD FAVOR A GENERAL
WESTWARD TRACK DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A
DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL WEAKEN THE HIGH
FORCING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ON A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK.  THIS IS
THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE.

DEBBY IS AT BEST A MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM.  A NOAA HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT FOUND A VERY POORLY DEFINED 1011 MB CENTER SOUTH OF EASTERN
CUBA WITH 35-40 KT WINDS AT 1500 FT WELL TO THE NORTHEAST.  SPORADIC
CONVECTION IS FIRING IN THIS AREA...AND THIS MAY VERY WELL MIX THOSE
WINDS DOWN TO THE SURFACE.  THE MAXIMUM WINDS WILL BE 35 KT FOR THIS
ADVISORY.

ALTHOUGH DEBBY SLIPPED A LITTLE SOUTH DURING THE NIGHT...THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOW 270/16.  A STRONG LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE
STORM IS PUSHING IT WESTWARD...AND THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD
CONTINUE FOR 24 HR.  AFTER THAT...THE STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN U.S. SHOULD WEAKEN THE RIDGE AND
POSSIBLY ALLOW A SLOWER AND MORE NORTHWARD MOTION.  HOW FAR NORTH
WILL LIKELY DEPEND ON HOW WELL DEVELOPED DEBBY IS. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST WILL BE SHIFTED WESTWARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BASED ON
THE CURRENT POSITION AND MOTION.  HOWEVER...SINCE THE GFDL...
UKMET...NOGAPS...AND AVN ARE ALL TO THE LEFT OF THE NEW FORECAST...
IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IF DEBBY MOVED FURTHER WEST THAN
CURRENTLY FORECAST. 
 
THE UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE/CYCLONIC SHEAR AXIS OVER THE NORTHWESTERN
CARIBBEAN IS RATHER STRONGER THAN FORECAST LAST NIGHT...AND IS
CREATING STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR OVER DEBBY.  THIS FEATURE SHOULD
PERSIST FOR 24-36 HR...THUS FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY.  DEBBY
COULD WEAKEN INTO A TROPICAL WAVE DURING THIS TIME. AFTER THAT
TIME...THERE IS A CHANCE THE SHEAR WILL DECREASE DEPENDING ON
EXACTLY WHERE DEBBY IS.  A MORE NORTHWARD MOTION WOULD GET DEBBY
TANGLED IN THE WESTERLY TROUGH...WHERE WESTERLY SHEAR WOULD AT LEAST
SLOW ANY RE-DEVELOPMENT.  A MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK WOULD HAVE A BETTER
CHANCE FOR RE-DEVELOPMENT.  THE INTENSIFY FORECAST WILL CALL FOR
SLIGHT STRENGTHENING AT 48 AND 72 HR TO REFLECT THIS POSSIBILITY.

THE AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER ASSOCIATED WITH A TROPICAL WAVE THAT
HAS BEEN MOVING ACROSS THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC HAS DEVELOPED ENOUGH
CIRCULATION AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A TROPICAL
DEPRESSION.  THIS IS SUPPORTED BY T-NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB AND A
FEW DRIFTING BUOY OBSERVATIONS IN THE AREA.

THE DEPRESSION IS IN ITS FORMATIVE STAGE AND LIKE MOST TROPICAL
DEPRESSIONS...THE CENTER IS POORLY DEFINED AND DIFFICULT TO LOCATE. 
SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE INITIAL LOCATION WILL PROBABLY BE NECESSARY.
THE DEPRESSION APPEARS TO BE MOVING TOWARD THE WEST OR 280 DEGREES
ABOUT 12 KNOTS.  MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS BUILD A RIDGE WESTWARD
WHICH WOULD MAINTAIN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ON A WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS MOTION WOULD BRING THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE AND ITS ASSOCIATED WEATHER NORTH OF THE LEEWARD
ISLANDS.

THE HIGHEST UNCERTAINTY...AS USUAL...IS THE INTENSITY FORECAST. WV
IMAGES AND RAOBS FROM THE CARIBBEAN CONTINUE TO SHOW STRONGER THAN
NORMAL SOUTHWESTERLY TO SOUTHERLY UPPER-LEVEL WINDS AHEAD OF THE
DEPRESSION.  THIS PATTERN IS UNFAVORABLE FOR A TROPICAL CYCLONE TO
STRENGTHEN.  GLOBAL MODELS HAVE BEEN FORECASTING THESE WINDS TO
WEAKEN BUT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED SO FAR.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY
FORECAST CALLS FOR ONLY SMALL INCREASE IN INTENSITY BEFORE THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE REACHES THE HOSTILE AREA.   HOWEVER...ONLY A SMALL
RELAXATION OF THE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS....AS INDICATED BY THE GLOBAL
MODELS...COULD ALLOW THE DEPRESSION TO STRENGTHEN MORE THAN
INDICATED AND THE INTENSITY FORECAST WOULD BE BUSTED.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION EIGHT HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED OVERNIGHT AND
DEEP CONVECTION HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY NEAR THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER...AND THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF 35 KT IS BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF 35 KT FROM TAFB AND 30 KT BUOY REPORTS WELL NORTH OF
THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  OUTFLOW HAS IMPROVED TO THE NORTH...BUT IS
RESTRICTED ELSEWHERE DUE TO SOUTHERLY SHEAR.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/12.  DUE TO THE SOUTHERLY SHEAR ON
ERNESTO...THE LOCATION OF THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS SOMEWHAT
UNCERTAIN.  I HAVE KEPT THE CENTER ALONG THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE
LARGE CONVECTIVE BURST DUE TO THE SOUTHERLY SHEAR...AND I AM NOT
READY TO CONSIDER THE CONVECTIVE PATTERN AS A CDO AS A RESULT OF
THE SHEAR PATTERN.  IF THE CENTER IS FARTHER NORTH INTO THE DEEP
CONVECTION...THEN BOTH THE TRACK AND INTENSITY FORECASTS WILL BE
OFF.  PUTTING ALL THE AMBIGUITIES ASIDE...ERNESTO IS EXPECTED TO
TRACK WEST-NORTHWEST THROUGH 48 HOURS AND THEN TURN MORE TOWARD THE
WEST AFTERWARDS AS THE TROUGH TO THE WEST WEAKENS AND MOVES WEST...
WHICH ALLOWS THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO BUILD WESTWARD NORTH OF THE
CYCLONE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE UKMET AND NOGAPS
MODELS...AND A LITTLE NORTH OF THE GFDL MODEL.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST HAS EVEN GREATER UNCERTAINTY DUE TO THE
CURRENT SHEAR PATTERN WHICH IS FORECAST BY ALL THE GLOBAL MODELS TO
WEAKEN SIGNIFICANTLY AND SHIFT WESTWARD THROUGH THE PERIOD.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO SHIFOR AND THE GFDL MODEL.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY MODEL TAKES ERNESTO UP TO 72 KT IN 72 HOURS INSPITE OF 
20 KT OF SHEAR FORECAST.  THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE CURRENT SOUTHERLY
SHEAR VECTOR SHIFTING TO MORE SOUTHEASTERLY IN 72 HOURS WHICH WOULD
ALLOW FOR MORE INTENSIFICATION THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INDICATES.

EARLY VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWS A NOT-WELL-DEFINED LOW LEVEL CENTER JUST
SOUTHWEST OF A CDO TYPE FEATURE.  THE INITIAL POSITION IS RELOCATED
NORTHWARD.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/13.  THE GFDL AND
UKMET MODELS HAVE SHIFTED A LITTLE NORTHWARD AND SO DOES THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH REMAINS AT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ENSEMBLE OF
GUIDANCE MODELS.  THIS REDUCES THE THREAT TO THE NORTHEASTERN
CARIBBEAN ISLANDS.  AN IMPORTANT STEERING MECHANISM IS A COLD UPPER
TROUGHLOW TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE STORM WHICH IS FORECAST TO MOVE
WESTWARD TO NEAR THE BAHAMAS IN THREE DAYS.  THE NORTHWARD SHIFT OF
THE MODELS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE STEERING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THIS
TROUGH.

THE INITIAL WIND SPEED REMAINS AT 35 KNOTS...WHICH ARE THE SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND KGWC.  THE SHIPS MODEL
SHOWS AN INCREASE IN VERTICAL SHEAR FROM 06Z TO 12Z FROM 20 TO 29
KNOTS AND INCREASING.  THE INENSITY FORECAST IS CONSERVATIVELY
DECREASED BY 5 KNOTS BASED ON THIS SHEAR.  IN FACT...IF THE LOW
LEVEL CENTER ON VISIBLE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO BE SHEARED AWAY FROM
THE DEEP CONVECTION...ERNESTO COULD WEAKEN TO A DEPRESSION.  HOWEVER
IN CONTRAST...THE SHIPS MODEL STILL CALLS FOR SOME STRENGTHENING
BASED ON AN OTHERWISE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/13.  ALL OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWS A
WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWESTWARD MOTION WITH A TENDENCY TOWARD A
NORTH-NORTHWEST TURN AFTER 48 HOURS.  THIS MOTION IS THE RESULT OF
AN UPPER TROUGH TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE STORM AND A RIDGE DEVELOPING
TO THE NORTHEAST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REMAINS SOMEWHAT LEFT OF
THE MODEL CONSENSUS BUT IS SHIFTED TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.

SOUTHERLY VERTICAL SHEAR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOW LEVEL CENTER
REMAINING EXPOSED TO THE SOUTH OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THIS SHEAR
IS DOMINATING THE NEARBY ENVIRONMENT AND NO INTENSIFICATION IS
FORECAST...EVEN THOUGH THE SHIPS AND GFDL MODELS CALL FOR
SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING IN THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

11 PM EDT SAT SEP 02 2000

THE HOSTILE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT OVER THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN
RESPONSIBLE FOR SHEARING CHRIS AND DEBBY HAS PERSISTED FOR THE PAST
TWO OR THREE WEEKS AND IS NOW SHEARING ERNESTO.  THIS HIGHLY
UNFAVORABLE PATTERN IS RATHER UNUSUAL DURING THE PEAK OF THE SEASON.

SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS
LOCATED ON THE EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION...BUT CLOSE ENOUGH TO
KEEP ERNESTO AS A TROPICAL STORM AT THIS TIME.  IN ADDITION...A
QUIKSCAT PASS AT 2200 UTC SHOWED SEVERAL POINTS WITH TROPICAL STORM
FORCE WINDS TO NORTH OF THE CENTER.  

MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS INSIST ON PARTIALLY REMOVING THE UPPER-
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN IN ABOUT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  IF
ERNESTO SURVIVES THAT LONG...IT COULD STRENGTHEN.  THIS IS SUGGESTED
BY EVERY SINGLE INTENSITY GUIDANCE EXCEPT THE MIT EXPERIMENTAL MODEL
WHICH KEEPS A WEAK TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THE PRESENCE OF AN UNFAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT COULD BE A REAL TEST FOR MOST OF THE INTENSITY GUIDANCE.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS ERNESTO WITH 35 KNOTS BECAUSE THERE ARE
NO SIGNS THAT THE SHEAR IS RELAXING AS HAS BEEN INDICATED BY MODELS.

THE FORECAST TRACK APPEARS TO BE LESS COMPLICATED.  A WEAKNESS IN
THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
ALMOST GUARANTEES A WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 72
HOURS. IN FACT...THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE.

ERNESTO REMAINS IN A MODERATE TO STRONG SHEAR PATTERN...BUT DEEP
CONVECTION HAS RE-DEVELOPED NEAR THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER
DURING THE PAST 5 HOURS.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES USING A
SHEAR PATTERN INDICATE THAT ERNESTO IS PROBABLY STILL AT LEAST A
MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM.  OUTFLOW IS FAIR TO THE NORTHEAST AND
RESTRICTED ELSEWHERE.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/15.  THE SOUTHERLY SHEAR PATTERN WILL
CONTINUE TO IMPART A POLEWARD COMPONENT TO THE TRACK...WHILE THE
MAIN STEERING INFLUENCE WILL BE THE LOW- TO MID-LEVEL EASTERLY FLOW
THROUGH 48 HOURS.  BY 72 HOURS...THE SHEAR IS EXPECTED TO LET UP AND
MOST OF THE STEERING FLOW WILL BE FROM THE SOUTHEAST OR SOUTH.  THE
UKMET MODEL IS THE FASTEST AND MOST AGGRESSIVE OF THE MODELS IN
TAKING ERNESTO RAPIDLY POLEWARD AFTER 48 HOURS...AND EVEN HINTS AT
RECURVATURE.  HOWEVER...THE UKMET HAS A BIAS TOWARD EARLY
RECURVATURE SO THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST AND BETWEEN THE AVN AND GFDL MODEL FORECASTS.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST MAINTAINS ERNESTO AT MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM
STRENGTH OWING TO THE SHEAR PATTERN.  THE MODELS HAVE BEEN
FORECASTING THE SHEAR TO DECREASE FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS...WHICH HAS
YET TO OCCUR.  WV IMAGERY INDICATES ERNESTO WILL BE MOVING INTO A
SHARP NARROW TROUGH IN 12 TO 24 HOURS WHICH MAY WEAKEN THE SYSTEM
DOWN TO THE DEPRESSION LEVEL.  BUT AS LONG AS SOME DEEP CONVECTION
REMAINS NEAR OR OVER PART OF THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER...THEN MINIMAL
TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY CAN BE MAINTAINED.  OF INTEREST ARE THE
GFDL AND SHIPS INTENSITY FORECASTS WHICH STEADILY INTENSIFY ERNESTO
TO 77 KT AND 962 MB IN 72 HOURS...INSPITE OF THE SHEAR PATTERN.

A LARGE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH...UNUSUALLY STRONG FOR EARLY
SEPTEMBER...IS SITUATED ABOUT 15 DEGREES TO THE WEST OF ERNESTO. 
THIS FEATURE CONTINUES TO IMPART SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR OVER THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE.  SINCE THE LOW CLOUD CENTER IS STILL NEAR THE EDGE
OF THE DENSE OVERCAST...DATA T-NUMBERS FROM THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE
STILL GIVE AN INTENSITY ESTIMATE NEAR 35 KNOTS.  SINCE THE SHEAR HAS
BEEN PERSISTENT...NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST AS IN PREVIOUS
ADVISORIES.  THERE IS OF COURSE A CAVEAT HERE...NAMELY THAT WE HAVE
VERY LIMITED SKILL IN PREDICTING INTENSITY CHANGE.

MOTION CONTINUES WNW...295/15.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS ERNESTO
MOVING AROUND THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC
ANTICYCLONE.  OTHER TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THIS
SCENARIO AND SHOW A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH DURING THE

PERSISTENT SHEAR HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON ERNESTO AND THE CLOUD PATTERN
HAS RAPIDLY DETERIORATED TODAY.  LOW CLOUD MOTIONS INDICATE THAT A
CLOSED CIRCULATION NO LONGER EXISTS...AND THE SYSTEM IS NOW A STRONG
TROPICAL WAVE.  THE WAVE SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD
AND IS ACCOMPANIED BY STRONG GUSTY WINDS...BUT ERNESTO IS
DISSIPATING AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE.
 
GUIDANCE MODELS SUCH AS SHIPS AND THE GFDL HAVE INSISTED ON THE
STRENGTHENING OF ERNESTO.  THESE MODELS HAVE PERFORMED POORLY ON
SEVERAL TROPICAL CYCLONES THIS YEAR.  APPARENTLY THEY ARE NOT AS
CAPABLE TO PREDICT WEAKENING IN AN UNFAVORABLE ATMOSPHERIC
ENVIRONMENT AS THEY ARE TO PREDICT STRENGTHENING IN A FAVORABLE ONE.

SATELLITE...RADAR...AND SURFACE OBSERVATION DATA INDICATE THE
TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THAT HAS BEEN TRACKING NORTHWARD ACROSS THE
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO THE PAST 2 DAYS HAS BECOME MUCH BETTER
ORGANIZED...AND HAS DEVELOPED INTO TROPICAL DEPRESSION NINE IN THE
NORTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO.

A TIGHT CLUSTERING OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES A TRACK IN A
GENERAL NORTHWARD DIRECTION. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST HAS THE CENTER
PASSING CLOSE TO CAMERON LOUISIANA IN ABOUT 8 TO 10 HOURS. 
HOWEVER...SINCE THE CIRCULATION CENTER IS SO BROAD...LANDFALL
ANYWHERE BETWEEN PORT ARTHUR TEXAS AND INTRACOASTAL CITY LOUISIANA
IS POSSIBLE.  ALMOST ALL OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE AGREE ON A 10 TO 12
KT FORWARD MOTION...SO THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO BE INLAND
SOMETIME ON SATURDAY.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH BEFORE
MAKING LANDFALL.  HOWEVER...IT IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT THIS
SYSTEM COULD REACH MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH DURING THE
DIURNAL COVECTIVE MAXIMUM PERIOD LATER TONIGHT.  AS THE DEPRESSION
NEARS THE COAST WHERE A COOL SURFACE RIDGE CURRENTLY RESIDES...THE
PRESSURE GRADIENT MAY TIGHTEN UP ENOUGH TO GENERATE SOME STRONGER
WINDS ALONG THE IMMEDIATE COASTAL AREAS...MAINLY EAST OF THE CENTER. 
ALSO...WINDS WILL BE HIGHER ABOVE THE SURFACE WHICH HAS IMPLICATIONS
FOR OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORMS.  SOME WIND GUSTS TO TROPICAL STORM
STRENGTH WERE REPORTED EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON IN PASSING SQUALLS.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION NINE REMAINS POORLY ORGANIZED OVER THE NORTHWEST
GULF OF MEXICO.  SHIPS OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THERE MAY BE TWO LOW-
LEVEL CENTERS WITHIN AN ELONGATED AREA OF LOW PRESSURE.  ONE CENTER
IS NEAR 26.5N 93.5W...WITH THE MAIN CENTER FARTHER NORTH CLOSER TO
THE DEEP CONVECTION....WHICH WAS USED IN THIS ADVISORY.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY OF 30 KT IS BASED ON SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES AND

THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS TRACK FORECAST OR
REASONING.  MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO INDICATE A TRACK IN A
GENERAL NORTHWARD DIRECTION AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST HAS THE CENTER
PASSING CLOSE TO CAMERON LOUISIANA IN ABOUT 6 TO 9 HOURS. HOWEVER...
SINCE THE CIRCULATION CENTER IS SO BROAD...LANDFALL COULD BE
ANYWHERE BETWEEN PORT ARTHUR TEXAS AND INTRACOASTAL CITY LOUISIANA

LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS EXPECTED BEFORE MAKING LANDFALL...
ALTHOUGH MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH COULD BE REACHED LATER

SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING SUGGESTS THAT THE AREA OF LOW
PRESSURE BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE SOUTHEAST U.S. HAS ACQUIRED
SUFFICIENT TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS TO BE CONSIDERED A TROPICAL
CYCLONE...AND ADVISORIES ARE THEREFORE INITIATED ON T.D. TEN.  A
QUIKSCAT PASS THIS MORNING SHOWED A FEW WIND VECTORS...MOSTLY RAIN-
FLAGGED...OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE.  AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN THE SYSTEM EARLY THIS AFTERNOON
TO SEE IF THE SYSTEM IS TRULY THAT STRONG.

THE DEPRESSION IS EMBEDDED WITHIN AN ELONGATED UPPER-LEVEL LOW THAT
IS PROVIDING SOME SHEAR AND LIMITING OUTFLOW.  DEEP CONVECTION IS
LIMITED TO A SMALL AREA SOUTH OF THE CENTER BUT THERE IS SHALLOW
CONVECTION IN BANDS DEVELOPING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE SYSTEM. 
WHILE THE SYSTEM COULD BECOME A TROPICAL STORM IN SHORT ORDER...WITH
A LESS THAN OPTIMAL UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN...RAPID STRENGTHING IS NOT
EXPECTED.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 250/5.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE ALONG THE MID-
ATLANTIC COAST IS PROVIDING THE STEERING FLOW BUT THIS RIDGE IS
FORECAST TO WEAKEN OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS WITH THE APPROACH OF THE
NEXT SHORT WAVE TROUGH.  THE UKMET KEEPS THIS RIDGE IN PLACE LONGER
THAN THE AVN AND TAKES THE DEPRESSION SLOWLY WESTWARD...BUT MOST
OTHER GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A RECURVATURE TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
CALLS FOR RELATIVELY LITTLE MOTION OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

RECONNAISSANCE OBSERVATIONS.  WHILE THE DVORAK SATELLITE TECHNIQUE
ESTIMATED AN INTENSITY OF 35 KT...THE RECON FOUND A LARGE AREA OF
WINDS AT THE 1000 FT LEVEL IN EXCESS OF 60 KT...AND EVEN A SMALL
AREA OF WINDS IN EXCESS OF 75 KT ON THE EDGE OF THE CONVECTION. 
THIS SUPPORTS SURFACE WINDS OF 60 TO 65 KT.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THESE WINDS PERSIST A BIT BEFORE MAKING FLORENCE A HURRICANE.

A BALL OF CONVECTION HAS ROTATED HALFWAY AROUND THE CENTER
OVER THE PAST 18 HOURS...AND IN RECENT IMAGES THIS CONVECTION HAS
PULLED THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER AROUND WITH IT.  THE LAST RECON FIX WAS
EAST OF THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND WE EXPECT AN ERRATIC MOTION OVER THE

GUIDANCE IS WILDLY DIVERGENT...WHICH IS COMMON WITH WEAK STEERING

HURRICANE INTENSITY...BUT THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS BEING HELD 
AT 60 KT DUE TO THE SHARP DECREASE IN THE CONVECTIVE PATTERN. 
OUTFLOW IS GOOD TO THE EAST...BUT RESTRICTED ELSEWHERE.

INITIAL MOTION IS QUASI-STATIONARY OR A SLOW DRIFT TO THE WEST OR
WEST-SOUTHWEST.  WITH THE RECENT DECREASE IN THE CENTRAL DEEP
CONVECTION...FLORENCE MAY BE STEERED BACK TO THE WEST BY THE
NORTHEASTERLY LOW-LEVEL ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE

GIVEN THAT FLORENCE IS A RELATIVELY SMALL CIRCULATION...RAPID AND
SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY CAN OCCUR DUE TO VERTICAL
SHEAR AND DRY AIR INTRUSIONS.  SOME OF THE STRONG WINDS REPORTED BY
RECON AIRCRAFT EARLIER COULD HAVE BEEN ENHANCED BY STRONG DOWNDRAFTS
CREATED BY DRY MID-LEVEL AIR WRAPPING INTO THE CIRCULATION CENTER.
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THAT A GOOD DRY PUNCH HAS WRAPPED ALL
THE WAY AROUND INTO THE CENTER...WHICH HAS LIKELY HELP TO ERODE THE
CENTRAL CONVECTION.  SINCE THERE APPEARS TO BE AN ABUNDANCE OF DRY
AIR AROUND THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE SYSTEM...ONLY SLOW
INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST UNTIL A PERSISTENT STEADY TREND IN THE
CENTRAL DEEP CONVECTION OCCURS.

THERE WAS AN ENTRAINMENT OF DRY MID-TROPOSPHERIC AIR INTO THE
CIRCULATION...WHICH DIMINISHED THE DEEP CONVECTION.  HOWEVER RECENT
WATER VAPOR IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THIS INFLUENCE MAY BE ABATING...
WITH AN INCREASE IN THE CENTRAL CONVECTION...ALONG WITH AN EYE-LIKE
WARM SPOT.  EVEN THOUGH THE SYSTEMS LACKS THE CLASSIC ANTICYCLONIC
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW PATTERN...VERTICAL SHEAR HAS BECOME
RELATIVELY WEAK AND IT IS SITUATED OVER 28 DEG C SST.  THEREFORE
STRENGTHENING TO A HURRICANE IS LIKELY...IF FLORENCE IS NOT ONE
ALREADY.  AIR FORCE RECON IS SCHEDULED FOR 12Z AND THIS WILL GIVE A
BETTER GAUGE OF INTENSITY.
 
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE MOTION OVERNIGHT AS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS
ESSENTIALLY WEDGED IN BETWEEN TWO MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONES TO
THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST.  STEERING CURRENTS ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN
WEAK FOR A WHILE AND TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW LITTLE MOVEMENT FOR
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THEREAFTER...THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW AN
AMPLIFYING 500 MB TROUGH ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST...CREATING AN
INCREASING WESTERLY TO SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING FLOW FOR FLORENCE.
THUS...WE EXPECT ERRATIC MOTION...OR A VERY SLIGHT WESTWARD
DISPLACEMENT...DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO FOLLOWED BY AN EAST-
NORTHEASTWARD MOTION IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE
CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ONE AND IS ALSO CLOSE TO THE LATEST GFDL AND U.K. MET. OFFICE

RECONNAISSANCE REPORTS THIS MORNING INDICATE THAT THERE HAS BEEN
LITTLE CHANGE IN FLORENCE.  THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND...AT 850

CONVECTION IS NOT VERY COLD AND MOSTLY ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE

WHILE THE UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN IS NOT PROVIDING MUCH OUTFLOW...IT
WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH TO MAKE FLORENCE A HURRICANE. 

TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN AGREEMENT THAT FLORENCE WILL NOT MAKE ANY
SIGNIFICANT WESTWARD PROGRESS.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESSENTIALLY
STATIONARY...AS FLORENCE SITS BETWEEN MID-LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE TO ITS
NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST...AND LOW PRESSURE TO ITS NORTHEAST AND
SOUTHWEST.  A MID-LATITUDE SHORT WAVE IS FORECAST BY THE AVN AND

HURRICANE FLORENCE HAS DEVELOPED AN EYE FEATURE IN SATELLITE IMAGERY
AND CLOUD TOPS HAVE COOLED TO NEAR -70C IN THE NORTHEAST EYEWALL. 
OUTER BANDING FEATURES HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED...WHILE THE OUTFLOW IS
CONFINED MAINLY TO THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
KEPT AT MINIMAL HURRICANE INTENSITY...65 KT...BASED ON THE BETTER
DEFINED EYE AND THE CONVECTIVE BANDING FEATURES.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 320/4.  FLORENCE REMAINS EMBEDDED IN A WEAK
STEERING ENVIRONMENT THAT IS FORECAST TO CHANGE LITTLE DURING THE
NEXT 36 HOURS.  ALL TRACK GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT 
FLORENCE WILL NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT WESTWARD PROGRESS.  WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY AND 13/00Z UPPER AIR OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT MID-
LEVEL WINDS HAVE ALREADY SWITCHED TO A WESTERLY DIRECTION ALONG THE
SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST AHEAD OF THE NEXT APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH.  ALTHOUGH THE APPROACHING TROUGH IS FORECAST TO REMAIN
WEAK...IT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO PICK UP THE HURRICANE AND
MOVE IT TO THE EAST AWAY FROM THE U.S. MAINLAND.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS TRACK... ONLY SLIGHTLY FASTER
AFTER 36 HOURS. THIS SCENARIO IS SIMILAR TO GFDL AND UKMET
SOULTIONS...ONLY SLOWER AND TO THE RIGHT OF THOSE FORECAST TRACKS.

THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST.
NOW THAT FLORENCE HAS AN ESTABLISHED EYE FEATURE...SOME ADDITIONAL
SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION IS POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY DURING THE NIGHTTIME

AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS REPORT LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH.  THE
CENTRAL PRESSURE IS DOWN 1 MB FROM THE LAST MISSION...BUT FLIGHT
LEVEL AND DROPSONDE-MEASURED WINDS BARELY SUPPORT HURRICANE
INTENSITY.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS BECOMING A LITTLE MORE
ESTABLISHED OVER THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE OF THIS SMALL SYSTEM. 
FLORENCE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN OVER SUFFICIENTLY WARM WATERS FOR THE
NEXT FEW DAYS...AND...ASSUMING THAT VERTICAL SHEAR DOES NOT INCREASE
APPRECIABLY...SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS POSSIBLE.  THIS IS
REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST.

LATEST FIXES SHOW A VERY SLOW DRIFT IN A GENERALLY NORTHWESTWARD
DIRECTION.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A BREAKDOWN OF THE WEAK MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST OF FLORENCE DURING THE NEXT 12
TO 24 HOURS.  THE STEERING CURRENT IS FORECAST TO REMAIN WEAK UNTIL
A STRONG 500 MB TROUGH DROPS INTO THE EASTERN U.S. LATE IN THE

INITIAL INTENSITY IS KEPT AT 40 KNOTS UNTIL A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE
REACHES THE AREA EARLY FRIDAY.  THERE COULD BE SOME LIMITED
STRENGTHENING ONCE FLORENCE BEGINS TO MOVE.
 
FLORENCE HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY BUT AN APPROACHING VIGOROUS
MID-LEVEL TROUGH SHOULD KICK FLORENCE OUT TO THE NORTHEAST AND THEN
NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD CLOSE TO BERMUDA AND THEN TOWARD THE CANADIAN
MARITIMES.  ON THIS TRACK FLORENCE MAY MOVE VERY CLOSE TO BERMUDA.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS A SLOW EAST-SOUTHEASTWARD
DRIFT...120/02...BUT ALL OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWS AN APPROACHING SHORT
WAVE TROUGH QUICKLY ACCELERATING FLORENCE NORTHEASTWARD.  THE
FORECAST TRACK IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY EXCEPT A LITTLE
FASTER...MOVING FLORENCE NEAR BERMUDA IN 24 HOURS.  THE FORECAST
TRACK ACCELERATES THE MOTION TO 30 KNOTS BY 36 HOURS.  TROPICAL
STORM WARNINGS ARE ISSUED FOR BERMUDA.

SSM/I DATA INDICATES THAT THE LOW LEVEL CENTER REMAINS NEAR THE WEST
SIDE OF THE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION AS IS EXPECTED IN A CONDITION OF
WESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR.  THIS SHOULD LIMIT ANY REINTESIFICATION
UNTIL THE FORWARD MOTION ACCERATES TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND PERHAPS
REDUCES THE VERTICAL SHEAR.

11 PM EDT FRI SEP 15 2000

FLORENCE HAS BEEN UPGRADED BACK TO HURRICANE STRENGTH BASED ON A
EARLIER RECON REPORT AND AN IMPROVED SATELLITE SIGNATURE DURING THE
PAST 6 HOURS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 060/21.  FLORENCE REMAINS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE
FLOW AHEAD OF A DEEP TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.  AS A
RESULT...THE HURRICANE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE MORE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST
AND CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE. THIS SCENARIO IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
MAJORITY OF OUR FORECAST GUIDANCE AND THE OFFICAL TRACK IS AN UPDATE
OF THE RPEVIOUS FORECAST A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE GFDL AND UKMET
MODELS.  FLORENCE SHOULD PASS VERY CLOSE TO OR JUST NORTH OF BERMUDA
DURING THE ENXT 6 TO 12 HOURS.  FLORENCE IS EXPECTED TO BECOME
EXTRATROPICAL IN 48 TO 72 HOURS.
 
THE INTENSITY IS HELD STEADY FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL
DECREASE AFTERWARDS AS INCREASING SHEAR AND COOLER WATERS BEGIN TO
AFFECT THE SYSTEM.  HOWEVER...IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FLORENCE COULD
INTENSIFY A LITTLE MORE TONIGHT BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF DEEP
CONVECTION THAT HAS FORMED NEAR THE CENTER.

CENTRAL GULF TOMORROW.  THE GFDL SOLUTION...WHICH TAKES A HURRICANE

THE DEPRESSION HAS FORMED FARTHER TO THE SOUTH...AND WILL BE UNABLE

VISIBLE IMAGERY AND SURFACE REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE
CIRCULATION OF THE DEPRESSION IS INLAND OVER THE YUCATAN. 
HOWEVER...THE MID-LEVEL VORTEX IS NORTHEAST OF THE SURFACE CENTER. 
ASSUMING THAT THEY MOVE TOGETHER...THE MID-LEVEL CENTER WILL SPEND
LITTLE TIME OVER LAND...AND THERE IS THE DISTINCT POSSIBILITY THAT A
NEW CENTER COULD FORM TO THE RIGHT OF ONE WE ARE CURRENTLY TRACKING. 

AS EXPECTED...THE NEW GFDL NO LONGER SHOWS A SHORT-FUSE THREAT TO
CENTRAL FLORIDA.  ALL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A SLOW MOTION INTO THE
GULF...BUT WITH VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSES TO THE TROUGH CURRENTLY
DIGGING DOWN FROM THE GREAT LAKES.  THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE IS BOUNDED
BY THE UKMET...WHICH TAKES THE DEPRESSION SOUTHWEST INTO THE BAY OF
CAMPECHE...AND THE GFDL AND LBAR...WHICH TURN THE SYSTEM TO THE
NORTHEAST AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND ASSUMES THAT THE TROUGH WILL
NOT HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  HOWEVER...SHOULD
A NEW CENTER FORM SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE NORTH OF THE CURRENT ONE THEN
THE GFDL AND LBAR TRACKS BECOME MORE LIKELY.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST REPRESENTS A DIFFICULT BALANCE BETWEEN THE
WARM WATERS IN THE GULF...THE POSSIBILITY OF A FAVORABLE TROUGH
INTERACTION IN THE SOUTHWEST GULF...AND SOME VERY STRONG SHEAR IN

SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT THE BROAD CENTER OF THE
DEPRESSION IS CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEASTERN PORTION OF THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA AND THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS OF STRENGTHENING AT THIS
TIME.  

NUMEROUS DROPSONDES LAUNCHED FROM THE NOAA HIGH ALTITUDE JET ACROSS
THE CARIBBEAN AND NEAR THE DEPRESSION REVEAL THAT THE DEPRESSION HAS
A WELL ESTABLISHED MID-LEVEL CIRCULATION WHICH IS NOT VERTICALLY
ALIGNED WITH THE SURFACE CENTER.  UNTIL THAT HAPPENS...AND I AM NOT
SURE IF IT EVER WILL...SINCE THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH MOST OF
THE TROPICAL CYCLONES THIS YEAR...NO STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED. 
ALSO...THE DEPRESSION HAS TO MOVE AWAY FROM LAND BEFORE
STRENGTHENING.  ADDITIONALLY...WATER VAPOR IMAGES SHOW A SHARP
UPPER-TROUGH OVER THE BAY OF CAMPECHE AND IT IS BEGINNING TO DISRUPT
THE EXCELLENT OUTFLOW IN THE WESTERN QUADRANT WHICH THE SYSTEM HAD
24 HOURS AGO.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR NO CHANGE
IN INTENSITY DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS WITH SOME STRENGTHENING
THEREAFTER AS INDICATED BY MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.  HOWEVER...THIS
FORECAST IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN SINCE THIS SYSTEM COULD REACH HURRICANE
STATUS OR COULD STAY AS A SHEARED DEPRESSION. 

THE TRACK IS ALSO HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BY EVALUATING THE MODELS.
PREVIOUS GFDL TOOK THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO NORTHWEST FLORIDA AS A
HURRICANE WHILE THE NEW RUN KEEPS A WEAKER SYSTEM IN THE SOUTH
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.  THE AVN AND THE NOGAPS MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM
OVER THE WESTERN GULF AND THE UK MOVES IT SOUTHWARD TO THE BAY OF
CAMPECHE.  AT THIS TIME...THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS NOT ABOUT

THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF A LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION ON INFRARED
IMAGERY.  THE IMAGERY DOES SUGGEST A MID LEVEL CIRCULATION NEAR THE
NORTH COAST OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...BUT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE POSITION.  THIS IS USUALLY THE CASE WITH WEAK
SYSTEMS AT NIGHT.  THE GUIDANCE MODELS ARE SOMEWHAT DIVERGENT.  THE
GFDL AND UKMET MODELS DRIFT THE DEPRESSION VERY SLOWLY OVER THE
SOUTH CENTRAL GULF FOR THREE DAYS.  THE DEEP BAM AND LBAR SHOW A
MOTION TO THE NORTHEAST GULF AND THE REMAINDER OF THE MODELS SHOW A
NORTHWESTWARD DRIFT TO THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS SLOW NORTHWESTWARD SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AS A KIND OF CONSENSUS OF ALL OF THE GUIDANCE.  

STRONG WESTERLIES ARE FORECAST NORTH OF 25N.  SO THE DEPRESSION WILL
HAVE TO MOVE SLOWLY AND STAY SOUTH OF THE WESTERLY SHEAR IN ORDER TO
SURVIVE AND STRENGTHEN.  THE SHIPS MODEL BRINGS THE WIND SPEED TO 69
KNOTS IN 72 HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS TO 65 KNOTS FOLLOWING
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE SHIPS MODEL IS BELIEVED TO HAVE A
POSITIVE BIAS FOR DEPRESSION STAGE AS THE SHIPS DEVELOPMENTAL DATA
SET DID NOT CONTAIN DEPRESSIONS THAT DID NOT BECOME TROPICAL STORMS. 
SO THE WIND SPEED FORECAST MAY BE A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE.

AN AIRCRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO INVESTIGATE THE AREA A LITTLE LATER THIS
MORNING.

DATA FROM A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE...SURFACE AND UPPER AIR
OBSERVATIONS FROM THE YUCATAN PENINSULA INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE
CENTER OF THE DEPRESSION IS STILL OVER LAND BUT READY TO MOVE
OFFSHORE JUST TO THE NORTHEAST OF MERIDA.  THE CIRCULATION IS
BETTER DEFINED THAN YESTERDAY AND THE PRESSURE IS ABOUT 1004 MB BUT
STILL NOT ALIGNED WITH THE VIGOROUS MIDDLE-LEVEL CENTER WHICH
APPEARS TO BE OVER THE NORTHEASTERN TIP OF YUCATAN. CANCUN RAOB
REPORTED 30-KNOT WINDS FROM THE SOUTHWEST AT LOW-LEVELS THIS
MORNING.

AS FORECAST BY GLOBAL MODELS...UPPER-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR HAS
INCREASED OVER THE SYSTEM SO ANY STRENGTHENING SHOULD BE SLOW.
HOWEVER...IF THE SYSTEM SURVIVES LONG ENOUGH...SHEAR MAY RELAX AND
IN ADDITION...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE COULD EVENTUALLY MOVE OVER AN
AREA OF HIGH OCEANIC HEAT CONTENT...WHICH WOULD FAVOR STRENGTHENING.
THIS THOUGHT IS REFLECTED IN THE INTENSITY OFFICIAL FORECAST. 

THE TRACK FORECAST IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. THE GFDL CHANGED ITS
TUNE AGAIN SUGGESTING A TRACK TOWARD THE NORTHEAST LATER IN THE
PERIOD.  AT THIS TIME...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL CONTINUE SHOWING
A SLOW NORTHWEST TO NORTHERLY TRACK AS SUGGESTED BY NCEP GLOBAL
MODELS.  HOWEVER...THIS TRACK MAY HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED LATER IF THE
CENTER REFORMS TO THE EAST CLOSER TO THE CONVECTION.

THE DEPRESSION IS GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND IS ON THE
VERGE OF BECOMING A TROPICAL STORM.  THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE
SYSTEM LOOKS IMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY.   HOWEVER...ALTHOUGH
THERE IS A VIGOROUS MID-LEVEL CENTER WITH A STRONG CONVECTIVE BAND
TO THE EAST...THE SURFACE CENTER IS STILL DETACHED FROM THE MID-
LEVEL CENTER.  EXCELLENT REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE CENTER HAS BEEN MEANDERING ALONG
THE NORTH COAST OF YUCATAN DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AND IT IS
EXPECTED THAT EVENTUALLY THE SYSTEM WILL BECOME VERTICALLY ALIGNED
AND STRENGTHENING WILL BEGIN. 

THE FUTURE TRACK IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.  MOST OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE
SHOWS A GENERAL NORTH-NORTHWEST TO NORTHERLY TRACK BUT IT IS HARD TO
IGNORE THE GFDL WHICH CONSISTENTLY...FOR THE PAST TWO RUNS...HAS
TURNED THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST TOWARD THE FLORIDA
PENINSULA.  BASED ON THE GFDL OUTPUT AND THE READJUSTMENT OF THE
EXPECTED SURFACE CENTER...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS BEEN
SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT A LITTLE BIT.  

DUE TO HIGH UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST...AND WEEKEND ACTIVITIES
COMING...IT IS URGED THAT ALL INTERESTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO SHOULD
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM WHICH IS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO
ANY PORTION OF THE COAST FROM FLORIDA TO TEXAS.

TROPICAL STORM GORDON DISCUSSION NUMBER   7
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT FRI SEP 15 2000

THIS HAS BEEN A BUSY EVENING TO SAY THE LEAST.  AIR FORCE RECON
FOUND 59 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS AT 850 MB JUST EAST OF THE CENTER
WHICH EQUATES TO ABOUT 50 KT AT THE SURFACE.  SATELLITE INDICATE
THAT CENTER HAS MOVED/DEVELOPED FURTHER NORTHEAST INTO THE DEEP
CONVECTION AND TOPS CONTINUE TO COOL NEAR THE CENTER.  OUTFLOW IS
GOOD TO EXCELLENT IN THE EAST SEMICIRCLE AND SLIGHTLY RESTRICTED BUT
IMPROVING TO THE WEST.
 
GORDON HAS BEEN MAKING A STEADY NORTHEAST MOTION OF 8 TO 10 KT
DURING THE PAST 9 HOURS.  16/00Z UPPER AIR SOUNDINGS INDICATE 30
METER 500 MB HEIGHT FALLS AT MIAMI AND 20 METER FALLS FARTHER NORTH
UP THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S.  THE SHORTWAVE
TROUGH RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE HEIGHT FALLS HAS SUPPRESSED THE RIDGE
SOUTHWARD TO CUBA WHICH HAS ALLOWED GORDON TO FINALLY MAKE A MOVE TO
THE NORTHEAST.  AS THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSES EAST OF FLORIDA...I
EXPECT THE RIDGE TO THE SOUTH TO GRADUALLY BUILD BACK TO THE
NORTHWEST WHICH SHOULD NUDGE GORDON BACK TO A MORE NORTH-NORTHEAST
OR EVEN NORTHERLY TRACK.  THE NEXT TROUGH IS FORECAST TO DROP INTO
THE SOUTHCENTRAL U.S. WHICH SHOULD KEEP SOME SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING
FLOW ON THE SYSTEM.  THE KEY WILL BE HOW FAR NORTH GORDON TRACKS
DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS BEFORE THE RIDGE BUILDS BACK IN
ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA.  THE NEW MODEL GUIDANCE IS SPLIT INTO TWO
CAMPS...WITH HALF THE MODELS...INCLUDING THE VARIOUS GFDL
MODELS...TAKING GORDON TO THE NORTHEAST. THE OTHER HALF TAKE GORDON
BASICALLY NORTHWARD...EXCEPT FOR THE UKMET WHICH TAKES GORDON
SOUTHWEST FROM ITS CURRENT POSITION AS A WEAK TROPICAL CYCLONE. 
SINCE IT APPEARS THAT GORDON HAS NOW BECOME A VERTICALLY DEEP
SYSTEM...WE HAVE LEANED TOWARD THE GFDL MODELS...ONLY SLOWER AND A
LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THOSE TRACKS.  THIS FORECAST IS A SIGNIFICANT
TRACK SHIFT TO THE EAST.  HOWEVER...RECON ALSO FOUND A SECOND CENTER
FURTHER EAST FROM THE OFFICIAL POSITION...WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE
STORM BEING FURTHER EAST THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INDICATES.
 
SINCE THE SHEAR HAS LET UP ON GORDON...STEADY INTENSIFICATION IS
FORECAST IN LINE WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL.  THE 48 AND 72 HOUR
INTENSITIES REFLECT OVER LAND CONDITIONS...WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO
ERRORS SHOULD GORDON SPEED UP OR SLOW DOWN ITS FORWARD MOTION.

RECENT AIRCRAFT FIXES INDICATE THAT THE MOTION HAS BEEN ERRATIC
OVERNIGHT.  THE RATHER UNCERTAIN INITIAL MOTION IS 025/8.  THE 00Z
AVIATION MODEL SHOWS GORDON NOT BEING PICKED UP BY THE TROUGH MOVING
ACROSS EASTERN NORTH AMERICA.  GORDON IS FORECAST TO TRAVEL TOWARD
THE NORTH OR NORTHEAST AT 10 KNOTS OR SO AROUND THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AT 500 MB.

THE 00Z GFDL HAS SHIFTED LEFT OF THE 18Z GFDL MODEL.  ALSO THE UKMET
HAS SHIFTED ITS TRACK 180 DEGREES AND IS NOW ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE
GFDL.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED ABOUT 10 DEGREES OF
HEADING TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THIS SMALL SHIFT
RESULTS IN A LANDFALL ABOUT 100 MILES FURTHER NORTHWEST ALONG THE
UPPER FLORIDA WEST COAST.  THE FOWARD MOTION IS ALSO SLOWED SOME
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND THIS RESULTS IN DELAYING LANDFALL TO
ABOUT 48 HOURS.  SO THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO THE HURRICANE WATCH AT
THIS TIME ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE TO BE SHIFTED TO THE NORTH AND WEST
IN SIX HOURS OR SO.  

THE WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS.  THE RECENT RECONNAISANCE FLIGHT
REPORTED 997 MB...DOWN 11 MB IN 18 HOURS...AND THE MAXIMUM WIND
SPEED REPORTED WAS 59 KNOTS AT 850 MB EAST OF THE CENTER.  ALL OF
THE GUIDANCE INDICATES STRENGTHENING TO A CAT 1 HURRICANE...MAINLY
DUE TO THE WARM GULF WATERS.

IT IS A BIT EARLY TO FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR LANDFALL LOCATION.  ALL

DEVELOPING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OVER THE ATLANTIC.  THIS PATTERN IS FORECAST TO

BIT TO THE RIGHT OF THE GFDL AND THE FSU EXPERIMENTAL SUPERENSEMBLE

THE CLOUD PATTERN IS GRADUALLY IMPROVING AND THE RECON REPORTED A
MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 992 MB AND FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 68 KNOTS.
UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE NOT IDEAL FOR SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.

DATA FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT
THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO 985 MB AND THAT
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS NOW ENCIRCLE THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  SATELLITE
IMAGERY INDICATES THE CENTRAL DEEP CONVECTION HAS INCREASED AND THAT
OUTFLOW REMAINS GOOD TO EXCELLENT IN THE EAST SEMICIRCLE AND
RESTRICTED ELSEWHERE.
 
THERE IS EXCELLENT AGREEMENT AMONG THE MODEL FORECAST GUIDANCE WITH
A TIGHT CLUSTERING IN THE BIG BEND AREA OF FLORIDA.  THE GFDL MODEL
...AND ESPECIALLY THE 18Z AVN MODEL...HAVE NOW SWUNG AROUND FARTHER
EAST IN LINE WITH THE OTHER MODEL GUIDANCE AND OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACKS.  ONLY THE AVN MODEL IS THE WESTERNMOST MODEL AND IT TAKES
GORDON NEAR APALACHICOLA IN ABOUT 36 HOURS.  THE 18Z GFDL MODEL WAS
SLOW AND FARTHER WEST THAN THE ADVISORY POSITION.  WITH THE STRONG
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE WEST CONTINUING TO DIG SOUTHWARD...THE
NARROW RIDGE ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA MAY BULGE NORTHWARD A LITTLE
FURTHER WHICH SHOUDL KEEP GORDON ON A NORTH-NORTHEAST TRACK. 
HOWEVER.. AFTER ABOUT 12 TO 18 HOURS...GORDON IS EXPECTED TO TURN
MORE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND POSSIBLY MAKE LANDFALL ALONG THE
FLORIDA COAST IN 24 TO 36 HOURS BETWEEN CEDAR KEY AND ST. MARKS. 
THE OFFICAL FORECAST TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE UKMET MODEL AND A LITTLE
EAST AND FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

GORDON MAY INTENSIFY A LITTLE MORE IF THE SHEAR LETS UP ENOUGH TO
ALLOW THE UPPER-LEVEL AND LOW-LEVEL CENTERS TO BECOME VERTICALLY
ALIGNED AND A CLOSED EYEWALL TO FORM.  DOPPLER RADAR DATA FROM KEY
WEST INDICATES THE UPPER-LEVEL CIRCULATION HAS BEEN DISPLACED ABOUT
15 NM TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE RECON SURFACE POSITIONS. UNTIL THE
SHEAR LETS UP...ONLY SLOW STRENGTHENING WILL OCCUR.  FARTHER NORTH
OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE EXPECTED
TO BE STRONGER FROM THE SOUTHWEST OR WEST WHICH WOULD ACT TO
PRECLUDE ANY SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT NORTH OF 29N LATITUDE.

HURRICANE GORDON HAS BEEN HOLDING ITS OWN DESPITE THE STRONG
SHEARING CONDITIONS EVIDENT IN SATELLITE IMAGERY.   HOWEVER...WITH
THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION NOW EXPOSED IN VISIBLE SATELLITE
IMAGERY...SOME WEAKENING MAY BE OCCURRING AS INDICATED BY RECENT
RECON REPORTS SHOWING THE PRESSURE HAS BEEN RISING.  HOWEVER...RECON
ALSO FOUND 73 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS AT 700 MB RIGHT ALONG THE
IMMEDIATE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA...WHICH EQUATES TO ABOUT 64 KT
SURFACE WINDS...AND THIS IS REASON FOR KEEPING GORDON AT MINIMAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 035/14.  THERE MAY SOME WOBBLING
ABOUT THE FORECAST TRACK UNTIL LANDFALL DUE TO THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER
BEING EXPOSED.  HOWEVER...ALL AVAILABLE GUIDANCE IS NOW CONVERGING
WITHIN 30 MILES EITHER SIDE OF LANDFALL NEAR CEDAR KEY FLORIDA IN 8
TO 12 HOURS.  THE FORWARD MOTION HAS INCREASED DUE TO THE STRONG
SOUTHWESTERLY MID- AND UPPER-LEVEL FLOW IMPINGING ON THE SYSTEM NOW. 
AFTER MOVING OVER NORTH FLORIDA...MOST OF THE GUIDANCE HAS SHIFTED
FURTHER EAST TOWARD THE U.S. SOUTHEAST COAST.  THE GFDL AND AVN
MODELS HAVE BEEN STEADILY SHIFTING TO THE EAST THE PAST 24
HOURS...WHILE THE UKMET HAS REMAINED CLOSE TO ITS PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACKS.  WITH SUCH A STRONG UPPER TROUGH DIGGING SOUTHWARD TO THE
WEST OF GORDON...AND THE FLOW ACROSS THE NORTHEAST U.S. FORECAST TO
BECOME MORE WESTERLY...I FEEL THE HURRICANE SHOULD TRACK A LITTLE
CLOSER TO THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST AND POSSIBLY EVEN MERGE WITH THE
COLD FRONT LYING OFF THE COAST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS TO
THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE UKMET
MODEL THROUGH 36 HOURS AND TO THE LEFT OF THE UKMET AND SLIGHTLY
SLOWER AFTERWARDS.

AFTER PEAKING AT 981 MB EARLIER THIS MORNING...GORDON APPEARS TO BE
ON A STEADY DECLINE IN INTENSITY.  HOWEVER...THERE IS SOME
UNCERTAINTY ON HOW ANY BAROCLINIC EFFECTS MAY BE AFFECTING GORDON.
ITS DOUBTFUL THAT GORDON WILL INTENSIFY BEFORE MAKING LANDFALL...BUT
IT ALSO MAY NOT WEAKEN VERY MUCH.  BY 24 HOURS...GORDON MAY MERGE
WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND BECOME AN EXTRATROPICAL SYSTEM. I HAVE
KEPT THE INTENSITY A LITTLE HIGHER THAN NORMAL IN CASE STRONG UPPER-
AIR DYNAMICS KICK IN AND MAKE GORDON A HYBRID SYSTEM OFF THE
SOUTHEAST U.S.
 
NO CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE GULF COAST WARNINGS.  THE TROPICAL STORM
WARNING ALONG THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST HAS BEEN EXTENDED NORTHWARD
TO LITTLE RIVER INLET SOUTH CAROLINA...AND A TROPICAL WATCH EXTENDS
NORTHWARD FROM LITTLE RIVER TO CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA.

GORDON HAS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR THIS
AFTERNOON...AND RECON COULD ONLY FIND 60 KT AT THE SURFACE.
THEREFORE...GORDON IS DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM.  HOWEVER...
RECON HAS ALSO INDICATED THAT THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DECREASED BY
5 MB SINCE EARLIER THIS MORNING...DESPITE THE SHEAR...AND THE
MINIMUM PRESSURE IS 985 MB.  SOME MODERATE CONVECTION HAS ALSO
DEVELOPED IN THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE BROAD CENTER OR EYE
FEATURE DURING THE PAST 3 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 030/12...OR EVEN 020/12 IF ONE GOES
FROM RECON FIX TO RECON FIX.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE
PREVIOUS TRACK FORECAST OR REASONING.  THE INITIAL POSITION IS A
LITTLE EAST OF THE RECON POSITION AND ROUGHLY IN THE GEOMETRIC
CENTER OF THE CLOUD-FREE EYE FEATURE SEEN IN VISIBLE SATELLITE
IMAGERY.  DUE TO THE NEW CONVECTION THAT HAS DEVELOPED WEST OF THE
CENTER...THERE MAY BE SOME LARGE WOBBLES IN THE TRACK UNTIL GORDON
MAKES LANDFALL NEAR CEDAR KEY FLORIDA LATER THIS EVENING.  GORDON
MAY MERGE WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOCATED ALONG THE GEROGIA-
FLORIDA BORDER AND TRACK CLOSE TO THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COASTLINE AS A
HYBRID SYSTEM UNTIL PASSING NORTHEAST OF THE NORTH CAROLINA OUTER
BANKS WHERE THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY 48
HOURS...IF NOT SOONER.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS A LITTLE LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST AND LEFT OF THE NEW 17/12Z UKMET MODEL RUN WHICH
KEEPS GORDON MOSTLY OVER OPEN OCEAN AFTER 18 HOURS.

GORDON MAY MAKE ONE LAST GASP AT INTENSIFICATION BEFORE MAKING
LANDFALL BASED ON THE RECENT PRESSURE FALLS.  HOWEVER...WITH SUCH
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO LAND...ITS UNLIKELY THAT GORDON WILL REGAIN
HURRICANE INTENSITY BEFORE MAKING LANDFALL.  AFTER LANDFALL...THE
INTENSITY FORECAST IS HIGHLY SUBJECT TO WHETHER OR NOT GORDON TRACKS
OVER WATER OR STAYS OVER LAND...AND ALSO WHETHER THE SYSTEM BECOMES
MORE BAROCLINIC.

REPORTS FROM THE HURRICANE HUNTERS INDICATE THAT THE CENTER OF
GORDON HAS REACHED THE COAST JUST NORTH OF CEDAR KEY...A PRESSURE OF
994.5 MB WAS RECENTLY REPORTED FROM THAT STATION.
 
PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER HAS
VANISHED...AND GORDON'S SATELLITE SIGNATURE IS HARDLY THAT OF A
TROPICAL CYCLONE.  YET...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS REPORT A FAIRLY SMALL
RADIUS OF MAXIMUM WINDS AND A DISTINCT WARM CORE.  EVEN THOUGH THE
AIRCRAFT DATA SHOW HURRICANE FORCE WINDS AT FLIGHT LEVEL...850
MB...THE LACK OF STRONG CONVECTION IMPLIES THAT THESE WINDS WILL NOT
BE WELL MIXED TO THE SURFACE.  IN FACT OBSERVATIONS FROM CEDAR KEY
SHOWED SUSTAINED...10 MINUTE MEAN...WINDS OF 46 KNOTS WITH A PEAK
GUST TO 59 KNOTS...PRETTY MUCH UNDERNEATH THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL
WINDS.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 60 KNOTS.  WEAKENING IS
FORECAST AS GORDON MOVES OVER LAND.  LATER ON...THE STRENGTH OF THE
STORM WILL DEPEND MAINLY ON HOW FAR OFFSHORE THE SOUTHEAST U.S.
COAST THE CENTER MOVES.  SOME GUIDANCE MODELS...SUCH AS THE LATEST
GFDL RUN...INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL REMAIN WELL INLAND.  IN ANY
EVENT...WE EXPECT THE SYSTEM TO BE LOSING TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS OR SO.
 
RECON FIXES SHOW SOME SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED...BUT THIS IS
LIKELY TEMPORARY.  INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 030/10.  GORDON IS
EMBEDDED IN THE STEERING FLOW ON THE EAST SIDE OF A MID-LEVEL TROUGH
OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES.  THIS FLOW IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY
INCREASE AS THE CYCLONE MOVES TO HIGHER LATITUDE  THE CURRENT
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS ESSENTIALLY ALONG THE SAME TRAJECTORY AS
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND SIMILAR TO THE U.K. MET. OFFICE TRACK...ALBEIT
SLOWER.

BUT IS STILL SOMEWHAT RAGGED.  THE LATEST QUICKSCAT PASS IN THIS

TIME...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW A GENERAL WESTWARD OR WEST NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION TO CONTINUE...BRINGING THE SYSTEM INTO THE CARIBBEAN.

NIGHTTIME MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY CONTINUES TO INDICATE A POORLY
DEFINED CIRCULATION...WITH THE ACTIVE DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE
EASTERN QUADRANT.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE ALL 25 KT...SO
THE MAXIMUM WINDS OF 30 KT ON THIS ADVISORY MAY BE A LITTLE
GENEROUS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/11...A LITTLE SLOWER THAN EARLIER.  A
LOW/MID LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS BUILDING OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC...
AND IS FORECAST TO BUILD WESTWARD WITH TIME.  THIS SHOULD MOVE THE
CYCLONE ON A GENERALLY WESTWARD TRACK.  ALL TRACK GUIDANCE SAVE
CLIPER IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
WILL BE LITTLE CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

THE DEPRESSION SHOWS ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW OVER THE NORTHERN
SEMICIRCLE...WITH WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWING AN UPPER LEVEL LOW
NEAR 15N58W.  THIS...COMBINED WITH THE CURRENT POOR
ORGANIZATION...SHOULD SLOW DEVELOPMENT FOR THE FIRST 24 HR OR SO.
LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE INDICATES A LARGE UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE
SHOULD FORM OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AFTER 24 HR OR SO...WHICH
COULD PRODUCE UPPER LEVEL EASTERLIES OVER THE CYCLONE.  THE NOGAPS

NIGHTTIME MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY STILL INDICATES A POORLY
DEFINED DEPRESSION.  THE CONVECTION IS TRYING TO ORGANIZE INTO A
BAND...BUT THE CENTER IS STILL EXPOSED TO THE WEST.  THE MAXIMUM
INTENSITY REMAINS 30 KT IN AGREEMENT WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 280/10.  A LOW/MID LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS
BUILDING OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC...AND IS FORECAST TO BUILD
WESTWARD WITH TIME.  THIS SHOULD MOVE THE CYCLONE ON A GENERALLY
WESTWARD TRACK.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE GENERALLY AGREES WITH THIS
SCENARIO...ALTHOUGH THERE IS MORE SPREAD THAN 6 HR AGO.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE ANTICYCLONE SEEN EARLIER OVER THE DEPRESSION IS LESS WELL
DEFINED NOW...AND THE DEPRESSION MAY BE INTERACTING WITH THE UPPER
LEVEL LOW NEAR 15N58W.  LARGE SCALE MODELS INDICATE UPPER LEVEL
WINDS BECOME MORE FAVORABLE DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HR...SO THE
INTENSITY FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING.  AFTER 36
HR...A STRONG UPPER LEVEL HIGH SHOULD CAUSE NORTHEASTERLY FLOW OVER
THE CARIBBEAN WHICH SHOULD BE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR
STRENGTHENING...BUT MIGHT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO CAUSE EASTERLY SHEAR. 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST ASSUMES THE DEEP LAYER EASTERLIES WILL FAVOR
SOME FURTHER STRENGTHENING.

AIR FORCE RECON IS HAVING DIFFICULTY CLOSING OFF A CENTER.  THUS THE
SYSTEM IS ON THE VERGE OF OPENING UP INTO A TROPICAL WAVE.  VISIBLE
SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER...OR VORTICITY
MAXIMUM...MOVING WESTWARD OUT AHEAD OF THE MAIN AREA OF CONVECTION. 
THE RAPID WESTWARD MOVEMENT OF THIS CENTER IS RESULTING IN A LACK OF
DEFINITE WEST WINDS OVER THE SOUTHERN SEMICIRCLE.  HOWEVER SINCE THE
PLANE REPORTED TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS AT FLIGHT LEVEL OVER THE
NORTHERN PORTION OF THE SYSTEM...WE WILL HANG ON TO THE SYSTEM AS A
DEPRESSION FOR THIS ADVISORY AND KEEP THE TROPICAL STORM WATCHES FOR
THE NORTHERN LEEWARDS.  HOWEVER...IF THE CURRENT DISORGANIZING TREND
CONTINUES...WE MAY BE FORCED TO DISCONTINUE ADVISORIES LATER TODAY. 

RAWINSONDE DATA FROM GUADELOUPE SHOW MOSTLY EAST-NORTHEAST WINDS
FROM LOW LEVELS THROUGH 250 MB WITH SOME HIGHER-LEVEL WESTERLIES. 
SO IF THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER SLOWS DOWN...THE SHEAR MAY NOT BE SO
PROHIBITIVE AND THE SYSTEM COULD SURVIVE.  FOR NOW...I AM SHOWING NO
CHANGE IN STRENGTH THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

NOT MUCH CHANGE IS MADE TO THE TRACK FORECAST OR THE REASONING...
EXCEPT THAT THE FORWARD SPEED...15 KNOTS...IS SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN
BEFORE.  A MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION IS
EXPECTED BUILD WESTWARD WITH THE TROPICAL CYCLONE...AND MAINTAIN A
MOSTLY WESTWARD STEERING FLOW.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS VERY
SIMILAR TO THE GFDL GUIDANCE.

EVEN THOUGH THE SYSTEM IS DISORGANIZED...WINDS TO TROPICAL STORM
FORCE IN GUSTS WILL PROBABLY OCCUR OVER PORTIONS OF THE LEEWARD

PERIPHERY OF A DEEP-LAYER ANTICYCLONE CENTERED TO THE EAST OF
FLORIDA FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN
DOES NOT SHOW PENETRATION OF THE MID-LATITUDE WESTERLIES INTO THE
GULF DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THEREFORE...FOR NOW...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST DOES NOT SHOW ACCELERATION AFTER THE SYSTEM REACHES THE
NORTHERN GULF.  THIS TRACK IS ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECTIVE

DESPITE THE APPARENT FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT...LOW
SHEAR...ENOUGH CONVECTION...LOW-PRESSURE...WARM OCEAN...HIGH OCEAN
HEAT CONTENT...YOU NAME IT...THE DEPRESSION FAILED TO STRENGTHEN. I
AM SURE THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF EXPLANATIONS AFTER THE FACT.
BOTH SATELLITE IMAGERY AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT
PREVIOUS TREND FOR STRENGTHENING IS NOT BEING OBSERVED AT THIS TIME
AND IN FACT...THE CLOUD PATTERN LOOKS WEAKER THAN 12 HOURS AGO. 
CONVECTION HAS DECREASED AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE A CENTER. 
HOWEVER...WE ARE KEEPING A 25 KNOTS DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME UNTIL A
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE REACHES THE AREA AND CHECK IF IS A CLOSED
CIRCULATION STILL PERSISTS.
 
WHATEVER IS LEFT OF THE SYSTEM...IT IS FORECAST TO MOVE TOWARD THE
WEST-NORTHWEST AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE
DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS.   A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH IS EXPECTED
THEREAFTER.
 
MOST OF THE INTENSITY MODELS...SUGGEST SOME STRENGTHENING BUT THE
SYSTEM HAS WEAKENED SO MUCH THAT INTENSIFICATION IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY
TO OCCUR.  UNTIL THE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE REACHES THE AREA... THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A MODEST INCREASE IN STRENGTH.
 
CUBA WILL PROBABLY DISCONTINUE THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING SOON.

THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
POORLY-DEFINED AND NON-EXISTENT.  THE BEST ESTIMATE...BASED ON A
LIGHT WEST-NORTHWEST WIND AT CABO SAN ANTONIO CUBA AT 12Z...IS THAT
IT IS CROSSING INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO.  THE NOAA
HURRICANE HUNTER REPORTED 35 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS EAST OF THE
CENTER AND CONVECTION IS INCREASING NEAR AND SOUTH OF THE CENTER.
THUS...IT WILL NOT BE DECLARED DISSIPATED YET.
 
THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 305/18.  THE COMBINATION
OF A LARGE ANTICYCLONE OVER THE ATLANTIC AND A DEVELOPING STORM
SYSTEM IN THE U.S. GREAT PLAINS SHOULD CAUSE A GRADUAL NORTHWARD
TURN OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS FOLLOWED BY RECURVATURE TO THE
NORTHEAST.  ALL TRACK GUIDANCE AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO.  SO DOES
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...WHICH IS SHIFTED TO THE WEST AND IS FASTER
THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS PROBLEMATIC.  THE CYCLONE IS ON THE VERGE
OF BREAKING OPEN INTO AN EAST-WEST ORIENTED TROUGH...AND THAT COULD
EASILY OCCUR LATER TODAY.  ON THE OTHER HAND...LARGE-SCALE MODELS
SUGGEST THAT THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW PATTERN WILL STAY FAVORABLE FOR
DEVELOPMENT FOR 24-36 HR WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR STRENGTHENING.  THIS
IS ANOTHER REASON WHY THE CYCLONE IS NOT BEING DECLARED DISSIPATED.
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES.  IT
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EVEN IF THE DEPRESSION DISSIPATES THE REMNANTS
ARE LIKELY TO BE A WEATHER-MAKING SYSTEM ON THE NORTHERN GULF COAST.

AFTER ALMOST DISSIPATING THIS MORNING...THE CIRCULATION OF TROPICAL
DEPRESSION TWELVE LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER DEFINED THIS AFTERNOON...
ALTHOUGH STILL IN THE POORLY-DEFINED CATEGORY.  ADDITIONALLY...THERE
IS SOME PERSISTENT CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE 25 KT FROM TAFB AND AFWA...AND THIS INTENSITY IS
SUPPORTED BY SHIP 9VBL REPORTING 26 KT AND 1008.7 MB AT 20Z.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 315/16.  THE COMBINATION OF A LARGE
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE ATLANTIC AND A DEVELOPING STORM SYSTEM IN THE
U.S. GREAT PLAINS SHOULD CAUSE A GRADUAL NORTHWARD TURN OVER THE
NEXT TWO DAYS FOLLOWED BY RECURVATURE TO THE NORTHEAST.  ALL TRACK
GUIDANCE AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO.  SO DOES THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.
 
WITH THE CYCLONE LOOKING SLIGHTLY MORE HEALTHY...THE QUESTION ARISE
OF WHETHER IT WILL INTENSIFY.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND LARGE-SCALE
MODELS INDICATE THAT AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS BUILDING OVER THE
GULF...WHICH WOULD KEEP THE CYCLONE IN A LOW SHEAR ENVIRONMENT FOR
THE NEXT 24 HR OR SO.  ON THE OTHER HAND...THIS SYSTEM HAS A
PERSISTENT HISTORY OF NOT DEVELOPING.  SHIPS GUIDANCE SAYS IT SHOULD
STRENGTHEN...WHILE THE GFDL SAYS IT SHOULD NOT.  GIVEN THE TRACK

PERSISTENCE UNTIL THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF REAL STRENGTHENING.

DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION.  SHIP AND BUOY DATA INDICATE THAT
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS REMAIN NEAR 25 KNOTS.  THERE IS A SLIGHT

ENCOUNTERS LESS FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FARTHER TO THE NORTH.  HOWEVER

THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SATELLITE PRESENTATION IS BETTER THAN 24
HOURS AGO. THERE IS OUTFLOW AND DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.
SHIP 9MIM5 REPORTED 25 KNOTS FROM THE SOUTH AND 1008 MB PRESSURE.
THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTRAL PRESSURE SHOULD BE AROUND 1007 MB OR
LOWER.  INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 25 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  

SATELLITE FIXES FROM ALL AGENCIES INDICATE THAT THE DEPRESSION HAS
SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY AND IS NOW MOVING ABOUT 340 DEGREES AT 12
KNOTS.  THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY TURN TO THE NORTH
AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND WILL LIKELY BE
INLAND OR NEAR THE COAST IN ABOUT 36 HOURS.  

THE BIG UNCERTAINTY IS HOW STRONG WILL BE AT LANDFALL SINCE THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE HAS DECREASED ITS FORWARD SPEED.  IT COULD BECOME A
TROPICAL STORM IF THE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE DEVELOPS AS FORECAST
BY GLOBAL MODELS.  HOWEVER...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE INDICATED AT
THIS TIME SINCE THE DEPRESSION HAS ALREADY HAD PLENTY OF
OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS WHILE MOVING
THROUGH WHAT WE RECOGNIZED AS A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.  OBVIOUSLY IT
WAS NOT FAVORABLE BECAUSE THE DEPRESSION NEVER INTENSIFIED. 

AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE WILL CHECK THE DEPRESSION IN A FEW
HOURS AND PERHAPS BOTH MOTION AND INTENSITY WILL HAVE TO BE
ADJUSTED.

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER FOUND 58 KT WINDS AT 1500 FT
NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER...WHICH CONFIRMED EARLIER BUOY REPORTS THAT
THE CYCLONE WAS STRENGTHENING.  THE CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS 1007 MB. 
HOWEVER...THE PLANE OBSERVED 1006 MB AT A COUPLE OF OTHER LOCATIONS.
TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE IS UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM HELENE WITH
45 KT WINDS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 340/11.  THE LARGE DEEP LAYER ANTICYCLONE EAST
OF HELENE SHOULD CONTINUE IT ON A GENERAL NORTHERLY TRACK FOR 24
HR...FOLLOWED BY A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS
THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. BY-PASSING THE STORM...SO
THERE LIKELY WILL BE NO SIGNIFICANT ACCELERATION DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO UP
TO LANDFALL...WITH SOME DIVERGENCE AFTER LANDFALL OVER HOW SHARPLY
EASTWARD HELENE WILL TURN.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES WITH A MORE
EASTWARD GROUP OF MODEL TRACKS AFTER LANDFALL...AND IS NUDGED A
LITTLE EAST OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THE FORECAST TRACK WOULD BRING
THE CENTER TO THE WESTERN FLORIDA PANHANDLE COAST IN ABOUT 24 HR. 
THUS...WARNINGS ARE BEING ISSUED FROM THE MOUTH OF THE PEARL RIVER
TO THE MOUTH OF THE AUCILLA RIVER.
 
DESPITE THE STRENGTHENING...THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS STILL NEAR THE
NORTHWEST EDGE OF THE CONVECTION.  SATELLITE IMAGERY AND MODEL
OUTPUT SHOW MODERATE UPPER LEVEL WESTERLIES OVER THE GULF BETWEEN
HELENE AND THE COAST...WITH STRONGER WESTERLIES OVER THE COASTAL
REGION.  THIS MAKES IT UNLIKELY...BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE...THAT HELENE
WILL BECOME A HURRICANE BEFORE LANDFALL.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST
TAKES HELENE UP TO 55 KT AT LANDFALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE
SHIPS MODEL.

THE HURRICANE HUNTER HAS NOT YET COMPLETED A FULL FLIGHT PATTERN...

AN EARLIER AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER OBSERVED A BURST OF
INTENSIFICATION WHERE THE CENTRAL PRESSURE DROPPED TO 999 MB WITH
FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 70 KT.  SINCE THAT TIME...THE LOW LEVEL CENTER
HAS SEPARATED FROM THE CONVECTION DUE TO WESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR. 
A NEW AIRCRAFT HAS JUST MEASURED A 998 MB PRESSURE.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS SET TO 55 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 360/11.  THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN EITHER THE
TRACK FORECAST REASONING OR THE TRACK FORECAST FROM THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  THE LARGE DEEP LAYER ANTICYCLONE EAST OF HELENE SHOULD
CONTINUE IT ON A GENERAL NORTHERLY TRACK FOR 24 HR...FOLLOWED BY A
TURN TO THE NORTHEAST AND EAST-NORTHEAST AS HELENE MOVES INTO THE
WESTERLIES.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO.
THE FORECAST TRACK BRINGS THE CENTER TO THE WESTERN FLORIDA
PANHANDLE COAST IN ABOUT 18 HR.
 
THE NORMAL FORECAST FOR A SYSTEM THAT LOOKS LIKE HELENE CURRENTLY
DOES WOULD BE FOR LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH...ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE
CURRENT UPPER LEVEL WESTERLIES.  HOWEVER...LARGE-SCALE MODELS ALL
SUGGEST THAT THE WESTERLIES MAY DECREASE JUST BEFORE LANDFALL...
WHICH WOULD OPEN THE WINDOW FOR ONE MORE ROUND OF INTENSIFICATION. 
BASED ON THIS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A LITTLE MORE
STRENGTHENING...AND THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE THAT HELENE COULD REACH
HURRICANE STRENGTH.  A COMBINATION OF LANDFALL AND INCREASING
VERTICAL SHEAR SHOULD WEAKEN HELENE AFTER 18 HR.  SINCE HELENE IS
STRONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECAST...THE SYSTEM COULD SURVIVE UNTIL
IT MOVES BACK INTO THE ATLANTIC.  HOWEVER...THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS
CURRENTLY LOOK UNFAVORABLE FOR ANY KIND OR REGENERATION AT THAT
TIME.

THE HURRICANE HUNTER AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE HELENE HAS A
SMALL AND RATHER ASYMMETRIC WIND FIELD...THUS THE RATHER PECULIAR
LOOKING WIND RADII.

A HURRICANE WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED FROM THE ALABAMA-FLORIDA BORDER
EASTWARD TO THE AUCILLA RIVER IN RESPONSE TO THE SOMEWHAT INCREASED

OVERALL THE TROPICAL CYCLONE REMAINS QUITE DISORGANIZED WITH LITTLE
EVIDENCE OF BANDING FEATURES ON SATELLITE IMAGERY.   HOWEVER
A SMALL PATCH OF DEEP CONVECTION REGENERATED NEAR THE CENTER WHICH
MIGHT ALLOW FOR SOME SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION DURING THE NEXT FEW
HOURS...OR AT LEAST MAINTAIN THE CURRENT INTENSITY UNTIL LANDFALL.
RADIOSONDE AND VAD DATA FROM THE EGLIN WSR-88D SUGGEST SOME
WEAKENING OF THE HIGH-LEVEL WESTERLY WINDS OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF
COASTAL AREA...BUT THERE IS STILL QUITE A BIT OF SHEAR OVER HELENE.
THEREFORE SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING IS UNLIKELY BEFORE LANDFALL.
HAVING SAID ALL THAT...IT WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH OF AN INCREASE IN
WINDS TO MAKE HELENE A HURRICANE.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS A LITTLE FASTER...NOW 360/13.  THE STORM CONTINUES
TO BE STEERED AROUND THE NORTHWESTERN PERIPHERY OF A LARGE DEEP-
LAYER ANTICYCLONE.  500 MB WINDS FROM THE 00Z RADIOSONDE RUNS
INDICATE THAT HELENES HEADING SHOULD CHANGE TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST
VERY SOON...AND THE CENTER SHOULD REACH THE PANHANDLE COAST IN LESS

KNOW THERE IS A TROPICAL CYCLONE BY JUST OBSERVING IR SATELLITE
IMAGERY.  STRONG WESTERLY SHEAR...LIKE IN MOST OF THE TROPICAL
CYCLONES THIS YEAR...REMOVED THE DEEP CONVECTION AND HELENE IS NOW A
TIGHT SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS WITH A FEW PATCHES OF DEEP CONVECTION. 
THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS RISEN TO 1003 MB AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL
WINDS ARE 50 KNOTS IN A FEW AREAS TO THE EAST OF THE CENTER. 
INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 45 KNOTS. 

HELENE HAS BEEN STEERED NORTHWARD AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE BUT NOW THAT IT IS A SHALLOW SYSTEM IT COULD
CONTINUE NORTHWARD OR EVEN NORTH-NORTHWESTWARD FOR 12 MORE HOURS
STEERED BY THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW.  THEREAFTER...HELENE SHOULD GRADUALLY
BEGIN TO INTERACT WITH A FRONTAL ZONE AND TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST
BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL.  THE AREA OF MINIMUM PRESSURE SHOULD BE

10 AM CDT FRI SEP 22 2000
 
THE CENTER OF HELENE MADE LANDFALL NEAR FT. WALTON BEACH FLORIDA
NEAR 12Z AND IS NOW MOVING 030/11 ACROSS THE WESTERN PANHANDLE.  A
RECENT BURST OF STRONG CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER SHOWED A VERY
IMPRESSIVE VELOCITY SIGNATURE ON THE EGLIN AFB WSR-88D...AND OTHER
MESOCYCLONES HAVE BEEN SEEN IN STRONG BANDS FURTHER TO THE EAST. 
THE VELOCITY DISPLAYS FROM THE EGLIN AND TALLAHASSEE WSR-88DS
INDICATE WINDS OF 45-50 KT ALOFT IN THE CONVECTIVE BANDS...SO HELENE
REMAINS A 35 KT STORM FOR THIS PACKAGE.

THERE ARE NO SURPRISES IN THE TRACK FORECAST OR TRACK GUIDANCE. 
HELENE IS RECURVING INTO THE WESTERLIES AND SHOULD GRADUALLY
ACCELERATE TO THE EAST-NORTHEAST OVER THE NEXT 72 HR.  GUIDANCE
AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO...EXCEPT FOR THE UKMET WHICH TAKES HELENE
NORTH AND DISSIPATES IT.
 
HELENE SHOULD WEAKEN FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HR WHILE OVER LAND.  IF
IT SURVIVES PAST THAT...SOME OF THE LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS
THE POSSIBILITY OF RE-INTENSIFICATION AS A EXTRATROPICAL SYSTEM AS
IT MOVES INTO THE ATLANTIC.  GIVEN THE LACK OF ANY OBVIOUS
BAROCLINIC FORCING IN THE MODELS THIS LOOKS A LITTLE DUBIOUS. 
HOWEVER...THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL CALL FOR SOME STRENGTHENING AT
THAT TIME IN COORDINATION WITH THE MARINE PREDICTION CENTER.

EVEN THOUGH HELENE WILL WEAKEN OVER LAND...A COMBINATION OF THE
CYCLONE AND AN OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE NORTH SHOULD CONTINUE
SPREADING HEAVY RAINS ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES FOR THE
NEXT 48 HR OR SO.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION HELENE DISCUSSION NUMBER  18
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT FRI SEP 22 2000
 
HELENE IS NOW A BROAD SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS WITH A BURST OF CONVECTION
EAST OF THE CENTER.  SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THE CENTRAL
PRESSURE HAS RISEN TO NEAR 1010 MB...AND THE HIGHEST SUSTAINED WIND
DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS IS 23 KT AT ALBANY GEORGIA.  THE MAXIMUM
WINDS ARE SET TO 25 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 045/15.  ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT HELENE
SHOULD GRADUALLY ACCELERATE IN A NORTHEASTERLY OR EAST-NORTHEASTERLY
DIRECTION THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS
BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

HELENE SHOULD WEAKEN SLOWLY OR CHANGE LITTLE WHILE OVER LAND.  THE
BIG QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CYCLONE OR ITS REMAINS MOVE
INTO THE ATLANTIC IN 30-36 HR.  THE AVN...GFDL...AND NOGAPS SUGGEST
THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME INTENSIFICATION AT THAT TIME.  HOW THIS
MIGHT HAPPEN IS NOT CLEAR.  THE MODELS DO NOT INDICATE A SHORTWAVE
TROUGH TO TRIGGER A BAROCLINIC DEEPENING...AND THE CYCLONE SHOULD BE
MOSTLY NORTH OF THE GULF STREAM...WHICH WOULD HAMPER RE-DEVELOPMENT
AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL FOLLOW THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND CALL FOR SOME STRENGTHENING...MAINLY DUE TO
INCREASE IN WINDS FROM THE FORWARD SPEED.  WITH THE UNCERTAINTY IN
WHAT THE CYCLONE STRUCTURE WILL BE AS HELENE APPROACHES THE COAST...
AND THE FACT THAT OTHER CYCLONES SUCH AS DANNY HAVE STRENGTHENED
UNEXPECTEDLY BETWEEN THE APPALACHIANS AND THE ATLANTIC...RE-
DEVELOPMENT AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE CANNOT BE RULED OUT.
 
THE COMBINATION OF THE CYCLONE...AN OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE
NORTH...AND THE APPALACHIANS SHOULD CONTINUE SPREADING HEAVY RAINS
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES UNTIL HELENE MOVES INTO THE
ATLANTIC.

THIS WILL BE THE LAST ADVISORY ON HELENE FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE
CENTER UNLESS REGENERATION OCCURS.  FUTURE INFORMATION WILL BE
CONTAINED IN STORM SUMMARIES FROM THE HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL PREDICTION
CENTER AND MARINE FORECASTS FROM THE MARINE PREDICTION CENTER.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT THU SEP 21 2000

SATELLITE IMAGERY AND A QUIKSCAT PASS INDICATE THAT THE AREA OF
DISTURBED WEATHER SOUTH OF THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS HAS ENOUGH
ORGANIZATION TO BE A TROPICAL DEPRESSION AND SO ADVISORIES ARE
INITIATED AT THIS TIME.  THE CENTER IS ELONGATED AND NOT WELL
DEFINED...MAKING THE INITIAL LOCATION AND MOTION UNCERTAIN.  IT
APPEARS AS THOUGH THE MID-UPPER LEVEL CENTER OF ROTATION IS AHEAD OF
THE LOW LEVEL CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 30 AND 35
KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...RESPECTIVELY.  GIVEN THE CURRENT DECLINE IN
DEEP CONVECTION...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET TO 30 KT.  THE
QUIKSCAT DID SHOW SOME RAIN-FLAGGED 50 KT VECTORS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/15.  THE AVN AND UKMET SHOW A WEAKNESS IN
THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION WHICH
SHOULD ALLOW SOME NORTHWARD MOTION.  HOWEVER...IF THE DEPRESSION
DOES NOT RECURVE WITHIN 48 HOURS THEN THE SYSTEM SHOULD TAKE A MORE
WESTERLY TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS THINKING AND IS
CLOSE TO THE LBAR.

UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE CONDUCIVE TO STRENGTHENING NOW...BUT THE AVN
SUGGESTS SHEAR MAY INCREASE NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
THE UKMET DOES NOT SHOW SO MUCH SHEAR AND THE DEPRESSION IS FORECAST
TO BECOME A MINIMAL HURRICANE IN THREE DAYS.

5 PM EDT THU SEP 21 2000

THE DEPRESSION REMAINS VERY POORLY ORGANIZED WITH LITTLE
CONVECTION...WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL AT THIS TIME OF DAY WITH IMMATURE
SYSTEMS.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 30 KT.  AT 18Z SHIP PCCY
REPORTED LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS NEAR THE CENTER WITH A PRESSURE OF
1008 MB.  
 
THE INITIALIZATION OF THE 12Z AVN...WHICH PLACES THE LARGER OF TWO
VORTICITY MAXIMA OVER 200 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE
DEPRESSION...DOES NOT GENERATE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE MODEL
SOLUTION.  IN FACT...THE DEPRESSION GETS ABSORBED INTO THIS FEATURE
AND THE RESULTANT LOW TRACKS TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE UKMET ANALYZES
THE SYSTEM TOO FAR TO THE EAST BUT IS NOT AS FAR NORTH AS THE AVN...
AND AS A RESULT HAS A TRACK MUCH FARTHER SOUTH.  BOTH GLOBAL MODELS
HAVE A SMALL MID-LEVEL RIDGE IN PLACE NEAR 20N40W IN 72 HOURS THAT
WE BELIEVE WILL KEEP THE DEPRESSION FROM RECURVING DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  MOST OF THE OTHER GUIDANCE...INCLUDING THE FIRST
GFDL RUN ON THIS SYSTEM...KEEPS THE CYCLONE ON A WEST-NORTHWESTERLY
TRACK FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL AND LBAR MODELS.
 
SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE BRINGS THE SYSTEM TO 80 KT IN 72 HOURS...
BUT THE DEVELOPMENTAL DATA SET FOR SHIPS ONLY INCLUDES DEPRESSIONS
THAT INTENSIFIED.  THE GFDL FORECASTS ABOUT 60 KT IN 72 H.  SHEAR IS
EXPECTED TO REMAIN LIGHT FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWO DAYS AND THE
WATER IS WARM SO STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

11 PM EDT THU SEP 21 2000
 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION THIRTEEN HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED THIS
EVENING AND HAS STRENGTHENED INTO TROPICAL STORM ISAAC.  BANDING
FEATURES HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFCANTLY DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS...AND
THE OUTFLOW PATTERN HAS BECOME BETTER DEVELOPED AND MORE CIRCULAR. 
A PRONOUNCED POLEWARD OUTFLOW CHANNEL HAS ALSO DEVELOPED.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB SUPPPORT AT LEAST A 35 KT
INITIAL INTENSITY.

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/13.  NOW THAT ISAAC HAS DEVELOPED INTO A
DEEPER VERTICAL SYSTEM...IT SHOULD BE STEERED MORE BY THE DEEP LAYER
FLOW WHICH TAKES THE SYSTEM OFF TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST THROUGH THE
PERIOD.  THE UKMET MODEL IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACKS...ONLY SLOWER...AND THE GFDL IS TO THE RIGHT OF THE OFFICIAL
TRACK.  BY 72 HOURS...THE GLOBAL MODELS DIFFER IN THE POSITION OF
THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY NEAR 55W LONGITUDE...AND ALSO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ISAAC.  ALL
THREE MODELS AGREE ON MOVING THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW TO THE WEST  AND
GRADUALLY WEAKENING IT.  THE UKMET KEEPS THE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH TO THE
NORTHEAST OF ISAAC...WHILE THE AVN MODEL DEVELOPS THE HIGH TO THE
NORTHWEST AND BRINGS NORTHWESTLY FLOW ON THE SYSTEM BY 72 HOURS. THE
NOGAPS MODEL IS IN BETWEEN THE AVN AND UKMET SOLUTIONS.  IF THE AVN
MODEL VERIFIES...THEN THE NORTHERLY FLOW WOULD TEND TO TURN ISAAC
MORE WESTERLY AFTER 60 TO 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN THE
SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST GUIDANCE ENVELOPE AND ALMOST ON TOP
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.
 
ISSAC MAY BE THE ONLY TRUE DEEP-TROPICS TROPICAL CYCLONE SO FAR THIS
YEAR WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING ADVERSE SHEAR ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC.  AS
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED...ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS AGREE ON MOVING THE
UPPER-LEVEL LOW/TROUGH ALONG 55W WESTWARD AND WEAKENING IT. 
ALSO...THE DISTURBANCE WEST OF ISSAC CURRENTLY ALONG 40W IS ACTING
TO DEFLECT SOME OF THE WESTERLY SHEAR WELL NORTH OF ISAAC...WHICH
MAY HAVE ALLOWED THE POLEWARD OUTFLOW CHANNEL TO DEVELOP.  THE
INTENSITY FORECAST IS HIGHER AND THE INTENSIFICATION RATE FASTER
THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...BUT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS STILL 
BELOW THE SHIPS INTENSITY MDOEL.  HOWEVER...WITH SUCH A WELL-
ORGANIZED CONVECTIVE PATTERN AND POLEWARD OUTFLOW CHANNEL...RAPID
INTENSIFICATION AND HIGHER INTENSITIES MAY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED ON
THE NEXT ADVISORY...IF THE DEEP CONVECTION PERSISTS NEAR THE CENTER.

TROPICAL STORM ISAAC HAS CONTINUED TO GET BETTER ORGANIZED AND
STRENGTHEN THIS MORNING. THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF 45 KT IS BASED ON
A SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 45 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB. 
BANDING FEATURES AND OVERALL CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO
IMPROVE...AND THE OUTFLOW PATTERN IS GOOD TO EXCELLENT TO THE NORTH
AND FAIR ELSEWHERE.  THE POLEWARD OUTFLOW CHANNEL ALSO REMAINS
INTACT AND IS EXPANDING TO THE WEST OF ISAAC.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 280/17.  ISAAC HAS BECOME A MUCH MORE VERTICALLY
DEEP SYSTEM THAN THE GLOBAL MODELS SEEM TO BE INDICATING.  THE
FORWARD MOTION HAS INCREASED THE PAST 6 HOURS POSSIBLY DUE TO THE
INCREASED DEEP LAYER STEERING FLOW AS INDICATED IN THE UW-CIMMS
WATER VAPOR WIND ANALYSES.  HOWEVER...THE MODEL GUIDANCE IS MUCH
MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED THAN THE PREVIOUS THREE RUNS AND GENERALLY
AGREE ON A WEST OR SLIGHTLY WEST-NORTHWEST DIRECTION THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS TRACK AND FASTER THROUGH 24 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL DECREASE
IN FORWARD SPEED AFTERWARDS.  THE NEW 22/00Z AVN MODEL SEEMS TO HAVE
A BETTER HANDLE ON ISAAC THIS MODEL RUN AND WAS FOLLOWED CLOSELY
ALONG WITH LBAR.
 
THERE IS NO APPARENT SHEAR FORECAST TO AFFECT ISAAC...UNLESS IT
DEVELOPS FROM THE EAST BASED ON THE RECENT INCREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED.  THE OUTFLOW PATTERN REMAINS IMPRESSIVE AND IMPROVING...WHICH
FURTHER SUPPORTS STRENGTHENING.  THE ONLY POSSIBLE INHIBITING FACTOR
IS THE DRY AIR THAT LIES AHEAD OF THE CYCLONE.  IF ISAAC OUTRUNS THE
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CIRCULATION...THEN
THE STORM-RELATIVE INFLOW WILL ENTRAIN DRY AIR INTO THE SYSTEM AND
CAUSE ISAAC TO WEAKEN. DUE TO THIS UNCERTAINTY...THE INTENSIFICATION
RATE WAS SLOWED AFTER 12 HOURS AND KEPT BELOW THE SHIPS INTENSITY
MODEL WHICH BRINGS ISAAC TO 91 KT IN 72 HOURS.

WELL ORGANIZED THIS MORNING ON SATELLITE IMAGERY.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE FROM 35 KT FROM KGWC TO 45 KT FROM TAFB
AND SAB.  A QUIKSCAT PASS THIS MORNING SUGGESTS THAT THE LOWER OF
THESE MAY BE CLOSER TO THE TRUTH.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS HELD
UNCHANGED.  THE OUTFLOW PATTERN IS IMPROVING AND STRENGTHENING OVER

GLOBAL MODELS...OR THE SHEAR OVER ISAAC WILL INCREASE.  THE
INTENSITY FORECAST IS A LITTLE LESS AGGRESSIVE THAN THE SHIPS MODEL
GUIDANCE PENDING SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE TROUGH IS RETROGRADING.

ISAAC IS EMBEDDED IN THE EASTERLIES TO THE SOUTH OF A MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE.  THIS RIDGE IS FORECAST TO MAINTAIN ITSELF AND

THIS AFTERNOON ISAAC HAS BEEN BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE
STRENGTHENING...AS IT HAS CONSOLIDATED A HEALTHY CONVECTIVE
STRUCTURE THROUGH THE DIURNAL MINIMUM.  OUTFLOW REMAINS GOOD TO THE
EAST AND NORTH.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN 35 KT FROM KGWC
AND 45 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND SO THE ADVISORY INTENSITY REMAINS
45 KT.  WITH THE IMPROVED STRUCTURE STRENGTHENING SHOULD BEGIN SOON
AND ISAAC IS FORECAST TO BE A HURRICANE IN 24 HOURS.  BEYOND
THAT...THE INTENSITY GUIDANCE IS NOT AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS EARLIER...
WITH A HINT THAT THE UPPER TROUGH AHEAD OF THE CYCLONE WILL BE
INCREASING THE VERTICAL SHEAR.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST...AS
BEFORE...CALLS FOR LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH LATE IN THE FORECAST
PERIOD UNTIL THE FUTURE OF THE UPPER TROUGH BECOMES MORE CLEAR.

THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE TO THE SHORT TERM FORECAST PHILOSPHY. 
ISAAC IS EMBEDDED IN THE EASTERLIES TO THE SOUTH OF A MID-

ISAAC HAS CONTINUED TO GET BETTER ORGANIZED THIS EVENING WITH A
SMALL CDO FEATURE HAVING DEVELOPED OVER THE SYSTEM CENTER DURING THE
PAST 4 HOURS.  IN FACT...A 2311Z SSMI OVERPASS INDICATED A 90
PERCENT CLOSED...10NM DIAMETER EYE-LIKE FEATURE EMBEDDED IN THE
CENTRAL DEEP CONVECTION.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WAS INCREASED TO 
55 KT BASED ON THE SSMI POSSIBLE EYE FEATURE AND SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES OF 45 TO 50 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB.  THE OUTFLOW CONTINUES
TO IMPROVE AND ALSO EXPAND TO THE WEST.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/11...WHICH IS GENEROUS WITH THE
FORWARD SPEED.  ISAAC MAY HAVE SLOWED ENOUGH TO FINALLY ALLOW THE
INNER CORE WIND FIELD TO CONSOLIDATE AND BECOME DEEPER IN THE
VERTICAL.  THE NEW MODEL GUIDANCE FOR THIS PACKAGE HAS SHIFTED
FURTHER SOUTH AND MORE WESTWARD THAN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  IN
FACT...THE GFDL MODEL ACTUALLY TAKES ISAAC SOUTH OF DUE WEST AFTER
24 HOURS.  WHILE I AM NOT READY TO BUY OFF ON THAT TYPE OF MOTION...
THE GFDL USUALLY HANDLES DEEP VERTICAL SYSTEMS QUITE WELL...SO THE
OVERALL TREND OF MORE WESTWARD AND LESS POLEWARD MOTION WAS 
STRONGLY CONSIDERED.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS TRACK AND BETWEEN THE LBAR AND GUNS MODELS.  THIS SCENARIO
IS REASONABLE BASED ON THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE
WEST OF ISAAC BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF WEAKENING AND LIFTING OUT
TO THE NORTH.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH
TO REMAIN INTACT AND EVEN STRENGTHEN... WHICH SHOULD ACT TO KEEP
ISAAC ON A MORE WESTERLY COURSE.

AS THE PREVIOUS FORECAST ALLUDED TO...ISAAC APPEARS TO ALREADY HAVE
THE STRUCTURE TO BECOME A HURRICANE...AND POSSIBLY A SIGNIFICANT ONE
AT THAT. HOWEVER...THE INITIAL INTENSITY AND INTENSIFICATION WAS NOT
INCREASED MUCH OVER THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THIS IS DUE TO THE SMALL
EYE-LIKE FEATURE BEING SUSCEPTIBLE TO MINOR AMOUNTS OF SHEAR WHICH
CAN EASILY DISRUPT THE SMALL INNER CORE CONVECTION.  HOWEVER...GIVEN
THE ALREADY WELL-ESTABLISHED OUTFLOW PATTERN...THEN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST MAY BE TOO LOW IF THE SMALL EYE-FEATURE PERSISTS AND
ACTUALLY BECOMES A WELL-ESTABLISHED EMBEDDED EYE DRING THE NEXT 6 TO
12 HOURS.  COOLER SSTS AHEAD WOULD LIKELY PRECLUDE ISAAC FROM
BECOMING A MAJOR HURRICANE DURING THIS FORECAST PERIOD.
 
NOTE: THERE CONTINUES TO BE AN UNNERVING SHIFT IN THE LONGER RANGE
PROGNOSIS WITH THE VARIOUS GFDL MODELS AND THE NOGAPS MODEL TRENDING
MORE TOWARD A WESTWARD TRACK BY 72 HOURS...WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO
THE 22/00Z MRFX RUN LAST NIGHT.  SOME EFFECTS BY ISAAC ON THE LESSER
ANTILLES...WHILE UNLIKELY...CANNOT BE RULED OUT AT THIS TIME.

METEOSAT IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN CONTINUES
TO IMPROVE GRADUALLY AND IT HAS BEEN CHANGING FROM BANDING TO CDO. 
THE OUTFLOW AT THIS TIME LOOKS GOOD WITH UPPER-LEVEL CLOUDS
EMANATING FROM THE CENTER TOWARD THE WEST AND NORTHWEST AT HIGH
SPEED.  THIS IS IN GENERAL A SIGN OF STRENGTHENING.  T-NUMBERS ARE
3.5 FROM BOTH AGENCIES SUGGESTING THAT THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS AT
LEAST 55 KNOTS.  

HOWEVER...DESPITE THE CURRENT FAVORABLE CONDITIONS...I SEE AN
UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT AHEAD OF ISAAC.  NCEP GLOBAL AND NOGAPS
MODELS DEVELOP A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE WELL AHEAD OF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE WITH A TROUGH DIGGING SOUTHWARD. THE ANTICYCLONE IS
ALREADY BEING DEPICTED ON WV IMAGES. THE UK MODEL BRINGS UPPER-LEVEL
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. THIS WOULD PLACE ISAAC
WITHIN A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT IN THREE DAYS UNLESS THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE MOVES FASTER AND REMAINS UNDER THE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE. 
IT SEEMS THAT ISAAC IS DOING THE OPPOSITE...ITS IS SLOWING DOWN
INSTEAD.  GIVEN THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS PREVAILED THIS
SEASON...THE OPTION OF SHEARING IS THE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR. 
NEVERTHELESS...I AM NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO MAKE A CHANGE FROM THE
PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST AT THIS TIME.  

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/10 OR SLOWER. THERE IS
ENOUGH RIDGING TO THE NORTH TO KEEP THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ON A SLOW
WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THERE ARE SEVERAL MODELS WHICH
KEEP ISAAC ON A FASTER WESTWARD TRACK BUT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS THE GFDL VERY CLOSELY.  THE LONG RANGE INTEGRATION OF THIS
MODEL BRINGS ISAAC FARTHER TO WEST THAN THE TWO PREVIOUS RUNS BUT
STILL NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 280/10 ALTHOUGH THE POSITION WAS
SHIFTED A LITTLE NORTHWARD BASED ON EARLY VISIBLE IMAGERY.  ALL OF
THE MODELS SHOW A SLOW MOTION VARYING FROM WESTWARD TO NORTHWESTWARD
THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS SLOW MOTION IS THE RESULT OF A CUT-OFF UPPER
LOW LOCATED NORTHWEST OF ISAAC AND MOVING SLOWLY.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST IS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...BUT IS STILL A LITTLE LEFT OF THE MODEL CONSENSUS.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 4.0/4.0/3.5 FROM TAFB/SAB/KGWC
RESPECTIVELY...SO ISAAC IS NEAR HURRICANE STRENGTH BASED ON THE
DVORAK TECHNIQUE WITH A NICE CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST FEATURE.  ONE
CAN ALMOST IMAGINE THE HINT OF AN INTERLOCKING BANDING EYE FEATURE
ON THE LATEST VISIBLE IMAGERY AND A 0759Z SSM/I PASS SHOWS A HOLE IN
THE CONVECTION NEAR WHERE THE CENTER IS ESTIMATED TO BE.  SINCE
UPGRADING TO A HURRICANE IS SOMEWHAT IRREVOCABLE...I WILL
CONSERVATIVELY INCREASE THE INITIAL WIND SPEED TO 60 KNOTS AT THIS
TIME AND PROBABLY UPGRADE TO A HURRICANE ON THE NEXT ADVISORY.  THE
PREVIOUS DICUSSION DESCRIBED A SCENARIO OF AN UPPER TROUGH
DEVELOPING OVER ISAAC...BUT THE SHIPS MODEL DOES NOT SHOW ANY STRONG
VERTICAL SHEAR AFFECTING THE INTENSITY FORECAST.  SO THE FORECAST IS
FOR STRENGTHENING TO 80 KNOTS AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

A TINY EYE FEATURE HAS PERSISTED IN SATELLITE IMAGERY ALL DAY.
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE UP TO 90/77/77 KNOTS FROM
TAFB/SAB/KGWC AND OBJECTIVE T NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE HIGHER.  THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 85 KNOTS.  THE SHIPS MODEL LIMITS
INTENSIFICATION TO 92 KNOTS...BUT THE OFFICIAL WILL GO A LITTLE
HIGHER SINCE SHIPS WAS INITIALIZED WITH ONLY 70 KNOTS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT TO 285/10.  THE
MODELS THIS AFTERNOON ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT A SLOW
WEST-NORTHWEST OR NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE UKMET IS
CONSIDERABLY FASTER THAN THE GFDL.  THE LATEST AVIATION MODEL SHOW A
RATHER WEAK SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AT 500 MB ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS

HURRICANE ISAAC DISCUSSION NUMBER  11
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT SAT SEP 23 2000

ISAAC HAS CONTINUED TO RAPIDLY INTENSIFY THIS EVENING AND IS NOW A
MAJOR HURRICANE.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF 105 KT IS BASED ON
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGING FROM 102 KT FROM BOTH SAB AND
KGWC AND NEAR 115 KT FROM TAFB.  THE SMALL 10 NM DIAMETER EYE HAS
PERIODICALLY BEEN CLOUD-FILLED...SO THE LOWER END OF THE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES WAS USED FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE OUTFLOW PATTERN REMAINS
VERY IMPRESSIVE AND CONTINUES TO EXPAND ON THE WEST SIDE. ISAAC HAS
MAINLY A SMALL INNER CORE CONVECTIVE PATTERN WITH LITTLE OR NO
BANDING FEATURES EVIDENT.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/09.  ALL OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE REMAINS IN
GENERAL AGREEMENT ON KEEPING ISAAC ON A 285 TO 290 DEGREES TRACK
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.  THE UKMET IS FASTER THAN THE NOGAPS...AVN...
AND GFDL MODELS.  THIS RESULTS IN ISAAC MOVING INTO THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF THE 200 MB SYNOPTIC-SCALE ANTICYCLONE WHERE SOUTHERLY
FLOW FORCES ISAAC MORE POLEWARD.  THE AVN AND NOGAPS SOLUTIONS ARE
PREFERRED WHICH ACTUALLY BRING WEAK NORTHERLY FLOW ONTO ISAAC BY 36
TO 48 HOURS...WHICH WOULD ACT TO TAKE THE HURRICANE MORE WESTWARD.
HOWEVER...ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS AGREE ON MOVING THE MID-LEVEL
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AXIS CURRENTLY ALONG 30N LATITUDE NORTHWARD TO 35N
LATITUDE BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THAT SCENARIO ALONE
SHOULD ALLOW ISAAC TO GRADUALLY SHIFT POLEWARD EVEN THOUGH THE
STEERING FLOW WILL BE FROM AN EASTERLY DIRECTION.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS ALONG THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE
ENVELOPE...BUT WELL NORTH...OR RIGHT..OF THE FSU SUPERENSEMBLE
EXPERIMENTAL MODELS.

NOW THAT ISAAC HAS DEFIED ALL ODDS AND HAS BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE
OVER SST WATER LESS THAN 27C...THERE IS NOT MUCH ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL
INTENSIFICATION TO OCCUR.  BOTH THE SHIPS AND SHIFOR INTENSITY
MODELS TAKE ISAAC UP TO 115 KT IN 12 TO 24 HOURS...WITH GRADUAL
WEAKENING AFTERWARDS.  THIS SCENARIO SEEMS REASONABLE GIVEN THE
IMPRESSIVE INFLOW-OUTFLOW PATTERN THAT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED..AND
ISAAC COULD POSSIBLY REACH MINIMAL CATEGORY 4 INTENSITY DURING THE
NEXT 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST KEEPS THE INTENSITY
A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE SHIPS MODEL AFTER 48 TO 72 HOURS DUE TO THE
EXCELLENT OUTFLOW PATTERN.

THE SATELLITE PRESENTATION HAS DETERIORATED OVERNIGHT...WITH THE EYE
BECOMING LESS WELL-DEFINED AND THE CORE CONVECTION BECOMING LESS
SYMMETRIC.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN
102 KT...AND THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 105 KT FOR NOW.  A TRMM
OVERPASS AT 0503Z STILL SHOWED A VERY TIGHT EYEWALL BUT IT APPEARS
THAT ISAAC HAS PEAKED.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/08.  THE FORECAST IS RELATIVELY
UNCOMPLICATED...AS ISAAC REMAINS SOUTH OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE
THAT SHOULD MAINTAIN THE CYCLONE ON A BASIC WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK
FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  THE 00Z AVN AND THE GUIDANCE DERIVED FROM
IT ARE GENERALLY SLOWER THAN THE UKMET.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A
MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW NEAR 25N53W.  THE AVN HAS A STRONGER
REFLECTION OF THIS FEATURE IN THE MID LEVELS THAN THE UKMET...AND IT
CONTRIBUTES TO A WEAKENING OF THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE...HENCE THE
SLOWER MOTION.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED A LITTLE NORTH OF
THE PREVIOUS TRACK BUT REMAINS SOUTH OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.
 
SOME SHORT-TERM WEAKENING WILL OCCUR IF THE TIGHT EYEWALL IS IN FACT
COLLAPSING...BUT CONDITIONS SHOULD BE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR AT
LEAST THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.

11 AM EDT SUN SEP 24 2000

AFTER RAPIDLY STRENGTHENING TO CATEGORY THREE STATUS...ISAAC HAS
WEAKENED THIS MORNING.  THIS WAS APPARENTLY DUE TO AN INNER CORE
FLUCTUATION SINCE THE LARGE-SCALE ENVIRONMENT STILL APPEARS TO BE
FAVORABLE.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS ONLY A SLIGHT
FLUCTUATION...WITH SOME WEAKENING LATER IN THE PERIOD SINCE ISAAC IS
EXPECTED TO CROSS OVER THE SLIGHTLY COOLER WATERS NEAR 43-45 W
LONGITUDE.  WESTERLY SHEAR MAY ALSO INCREASE OVER THE HURRICANE IN A
COUPLE OF DAYS.  THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NEAR
25N53W APPEARS TO HAVE WEAKENED...BUT THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
PREDICTS A NEW UPPER LOW TO DROP INTO ABOUT THE SAME PLACE IN THE
LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE SHEAR.

ON THE OTHER HAND THE U.K. MET OFFICE MODEL RUN KEEPS A FAVORABLE
UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD.  THE LATEST SHIPS MODEL
OUTPUT CALLS FOR GREATER WEAKENING THAN I HAVE INDICATED HERE...BUT
IT SEEMS TO BE EXAGGERATING THE INFLUENCE OF LOWER SST.

MOTION CONTINUES WNW AT A SLIGHTLY FASTER FORWARD SPEED...290/10.   
ISAAC IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN SOUTH OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE FOR THE
NEXT FEW DAYS...AND THEREFORE CONTINUE ITS WNW MOTION. THE CURRENT
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND IS
ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE SUITE.  IT IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR
TO THE LATEST RUN OF THE EXPERIMENTAL FSU SUPERENSEMBLE MODEL.

THE RADII OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS HAVE BEEN INCREASED SLIGHTLY
ON THE BASIS OF A RECENT QUIKSCAT PASS.

THE EYE HAS MADE A REAPPEARANCE ON VISIBLE AND ENHANCED IR

ALTHOUGH SOME MORE FLUCTUATIONS ARE LIKELY DUE TO INNER CORE CHANGES
DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO...WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY NO SKILL IN
PREDICTING THESE CHANGES.  THEREFORE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL
MERELY MAINTAIN THE CURRENT INTENSITY FOR A WHILE.  LATER IN THE

ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS INDICATE INCREASING
SHEAR TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE HURRICANE.  THE SHIPS MODEL SHOWS
GREATER WEAKENING...BUT PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED SST...WHICH DOES
NOT SEEM TO BE TOTALLY REALISTIC.

NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE TRACK FORECAST OR THE
REASONING BEHIND IT.  MOTION REMAINS 290/10. ISAAC SHOULD CONTINUE

THE EYE OF ISAAC HAS BEEN INTERMITTENT IN INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY
THE PAST 6 HOURS...BUT SHOWS UP NICELY AS A 5NM DIAMETER EYE IN
RECENT TRMM AND SSMI OVERPASSES.  HOWEVER...A 1944Z TRMM OVERPASS
SHOWED THE MID-LEVEL CENTER DISPLACED A LITTLE TO THE NORTHEAST OF
THE LOW-LEVEL EYE...SO THE INITIAL POSITION IS SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE
SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES OBTAINED FROM THE VARIOUS SATELLITE
AGENCIES. THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 100 KT BASED ON SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 90 KT FROM ALL THREE AGENCIES...THE VERY COLD
TOPS OF -80 TO -82C THAT HAVE DEVELOPED NEAR THE EYE...PLUS THE
SMALL EYE SEEN IN MICROWAVE IMAGERY.  DUE TO THE SMALL EYE DIAMETER
...JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER WILL OBSCURE THE EYE FEATURE
IN INFRARED IMAGERY AND CAUSE THE INTENSITY ESTIMATES TO BE LOW.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/08.  THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUS TRACK OR INTENSITY FORECASTS. ISAAC HAS MADE
A LARGE WOBBLE TO THE NORTHWEST DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS...BUT A
GENERAL TRACK BACK TOWARD 290 DEGREES IS EXPECTED ONCE THE INNER
CORE CONVECTIVE FLUCTUATIONS SMOOTH OUT.  ALL THE MODELS MAINTAIN
THE STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ISAAC THROUGHOUT THE
PERIOD...WHICH SHOULD KEEP ISAAC ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK. 
THE UKMET MODEL IS THE FASTEST MODEL AND TURNS ISAAC DUE WEST AFTER

HAS A LARGE OUTER CIRCULATION ENVELOPE AND IT MAY BE SOMEWHAT
RESILIENT TO THE SHEAR.   HOWEVER IF THE SYSTEM GETS MORE DISRUPTED-
LOOKING LATER TODAY...THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL NEED TO BE

HURRICANE ISAAC DISCUSSION NUMBER  19
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON SEP 25 2000

...CORRECTED ADVISORY NUMBER TO 19... 

ISAAC HAS BEEN ABLE TO REMAIN NEARLY STEADY IN INTENSITY THE PAST 6
HOURS...DESPITE SOME WEAK WESTERLY SHEAR.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 90 KT BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 90 KT FROM
BOTH TAFB AND KGWC.  ISAAC MAY INTERMITTENTLY BE A LITTLE STRONGER
AS INDICATED BY A SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 102 KT FROM SAB...
BUT THE EYE FEATURE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PERSIST IN INFRARED IMAGERY
AND THE CDO IS ELONGATED MORE EAST-WEST WHICH SUGGESTS SOME
DISRUPTION OF THE INNER CORE CONVECTION AND WIND FIELD.  HOWEVER...
TRMM AND SSMI OVERPASSES DURING THE PAST 4 HOURS STILL INDICATE A
SMALL EYE ON THE ORDER OF 5 TO 10 NM IN DIAMETER.  OUTFLOW REMAINS
IMPRESSIVE...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE.
 
MOTION ESTIMATE CONTINUES TO BE...300/9.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT
CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR REASONING.  ISAAC IS
TRACKING AROUND THE SOUTHWEST PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE
AND...IN TIME...THE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. IS EXPECTED TO
GRADUALLY PUSH OFF THE EAST COAST AND ERODE THE WESTERN PORTION OF
THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW ISAAC TO GRADUALLY TURN
MORE POLEWARD...POSSIBLY BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS IS
IN AGREEMENT WITH ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS
CLOSE TO THE GFDL MODEL.
 
THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST.  THERE WILL
LIKELY BE SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INTENSITY DURING THE NEXT 48
HOURS...BUT LITTLE SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT SHOULD OCCUR FOR THE MOST
PART DUE TO THE WEAK TO MODERATE WESTERLY SHEAR AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM.
 
HOWEVER... AFTER 48 HOURS...ISAAC WILL BE MOVING OVER WARMER WATER
AND THE SHEAR MAY LET UP JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR SOME STRENGTHENING
BEFORE INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR BEGINS TO AFFECT THE CYCLONE
AHEAD OF THE U.S. EAST COAST UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH.
 
THE 34-KT WIND RADII WERE INCREASED SLIGHTLY BASED ON RECENT GALE
WIND RADIUS ANALYSES FROM KGWC.

DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN AT 90 KT...AND I
NOTE IN PASSING THAT THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE FROM SAB WAS ERRONEOUSLY
REPORTED TO BE 102 KT.   THERE IS NO EYE PRESENT.  THE LAST FEW
SATELLITE IMAGES...AS WELL AS A RECENTLY-RECEIVED MICROWAVE
PASS...INDICATE THAT SHEAR IS BEGINNING TO HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON
ISAAC.  IN FACT...VISIBLE IMAGERY IN ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO MAY SHOW
THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS FARTHER SOUTH AND WEST THAN I HAVE WITH
THIS ADVISORY.  IF SO...THE SYSTEM IS NOT AS STRONG AS INDICATED
HERE.

MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO FOLLOWED BY A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST. 
AS THE UPPER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC THE STEERING
GRADIENT SHOULD INCREASE AND RESULT IN A SLIGHTLY FASTER FORWARD
SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.

11 AM EDT TUE SEP 26 2000

AS WAS SUSPECTED EARLIER...SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR IS HAVING A GREATER
IMPACT ON ISAAC THIS MORNING.  THIS IS APPARENTLY DUE TO A LITTLE
STRONGER EAST-SOUTHEASTERLY LOW-LEVEL FLOW RATHER THAN STRONGER
UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 80
KNOTS...AND A LITTLE MORE WEAKENING MAY OCCUR DUE TO THE CURRENT
SHEARING ENVIRONMENT.  THE INTENSITY TRENDS SHOWN BELOW ARE SIMILAR
TO THOSE GIVEN BY THE LATEST SHIPS GUIDANCE.  LATER IN THE
PERIOD...AS ISAAC TURNS MORE TO THE RIGHT AND SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES BECOME A LITTLE WARMER...RESTRENGTHENING MAY OCCUR.

AS A RESULT OF THE SHEAR...THE CENTER IS LOCATED A LITTLE TO THE
SOUTHWEST OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.  INITIAL MOTION IS ADJUSTED
SLIGHTLY MORE TO THE WEST...290/10.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS ALSO
SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORIES FOR THE
FIRST HALF OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...BUT IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
THEREAFTER.  ISAAC SHOULD GRADUALLY TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND
INCREASE ITS FORWARD SPEED IN RESPONSE TO AN INCREASED STEERING FLOW
BETWEEN THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH AND A BROAD TROUGH OVER THE EXTREME
WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK IS ROUGHLY A CONSENSUS OF ALL OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE TRACKS...
WHICH REMAIN IN FAIRLY CLOSE AGREEMENT ON HEADING BUT WITH SOME
VARIANCE OF FORWARD SPEEDS.

RECENT IMAGES SHOW BURSTS OF DEEP CONVECTION COVERING THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER...BUT THE CONVECTION IS NOT VERY SYMMETRIC AND THE MID-LEVEL
CENTER MAY STILL NOT BE VERTICALLY ALIGNED WITH THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER.  DVORAK CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE NEAR 80 KNOTS SO THE
INITIAL WIND SPEED ESTIMATE IS FIXED AT 80 KNOTS.  OUTFLOW CONTINUES
TO BE POOR TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE SYSTEM BUT MAY BE EXPANDING EVER
SO SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE INCREASE IN CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER MAY BE A SIGN OF STRENGTHENING BUT UNTIL THE ORGANIZATION IS
CLEARLY IMPROVED...I WILL NOT FORECAST INTENSIFICATION IN THE SHORT
TERM.  LATER ON...WARMER WATERS AND PERHAPS REDUCED SHEAR MAY ALLOW
SOME STRENGTHENING.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/11.  ISAAC HAS NOT YET REACHED THE
WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE BUT IT SHOULD DO SO
WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS...AND TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.  THIS IS
SUPPORTED BY ALL OF THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS ROUGHLY OF A CONSENSUS OF THE DYNAMICAL MODELS...AND A BIT FASTER
THAN THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

OUTER WIND RADII HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY REDUCED BASED ON A QUIKSCAT PASS
OVER ISAAC FROM EARLIER TODAY.

ISAAC HAS REDEVELOPED DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER AND
A WEAK EYE FEATURE CAN BE SEEN IN INFRARED IMAGERY.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS MAINTAINED AT 80 KT BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF 80 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.  THE INITIAL POSITION WAS
LOCATED JUST A LITTLE TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE SATELLITE FIX
POSITIONS DUE TO SOME SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR DISPLACING THE MID- AND
UPPER-LEVEL CIRCULATIONS TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER.
 
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/11.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR REASONING.  ISAAC MADE A LARGE
WOBBLE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...OR 320 DEGREES...DURING THE PAST 6
HOURS AS THE CONVECTION REDEVELOPED AROUND THE CENTER.  HOWEVER...A
GENERAL TRACK TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST SHOULD RESUME NOW THAT ISAAC
IS BEING STEERED BY THE DEEP LAYER FLOW AGAIN.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK
IS JUST EAST OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST THROUGH 36 HOURS DUE TO THE
RECENT RIGHTWARD SHIFT IN THE POSITION...BUT AFTERWARDS THE OFFICIAL
TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH
ALL OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE...WHICH IS TIGHTLY PACKED AROUND THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK.

THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST OR REASONING. 
HOWEVER...THE 12 FT SEAS RADII WERE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BASED ON
RECENT SHIP REPORTS WELL TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTHEAST OF ISAAC.

A TRMM OVERPASS AT 0259Z FROM THE NRL WEB PAGE SHOWED THAT ISAAC HAS
DEVELOPED A NEW EYEWALL...AT 45 NM IN DIAMETER CONSIDERABLY LARGER
THAN THE ONE IT HAD A COUPLE DAYS AGO.  SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE STILL 80 KT...AND THE UW OBJECTIVE
DVORAK ESTIMATE IS 90 KT.  WITH THE FORMATION OF A NEW EYEWALL THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY SPLITS THE DIFFERENCE AND BUMPS THE INTENSITY UP
TO 85 KT.  THE OVERALL OUTFLOW PATTERN...ALTHOUGH NOT GREAT...IS
IMPROVING AND ISAAC WILL BE MOVING OVER SLIGHTLY WARMER WATERS.  ALL
OF THE ABOVE SUGGESTS THAT THERE WILL BE SOME INTENSIFICATION OVER
THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS AND ISAAC IS EXPECTED TO BECOME A MAJOR
HURRICANE AGAIN.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 305/12.  ISAAC IS MOVING AROUND THE
WESTERN PERIMETER OF A MID-LEVEL RIDGE.  WITH A SIGNIFICANT TROUGH
MOVING INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...ISAAC IS EXPECTED TO TURN MORE TO
THE RIGHT BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN
EXCELLENT AGREEMENT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST ADJUSTS THE PREVIOUS 72
HOUR FORECAST POINT TO THE RIGHT AND IS VERY CLOSE TO THE UKMET AND
GFDL.

ON THIS TRACK ISAAC WOULD PASS WELL TO THE EAST OF BERMUDA.

SURROUNDED BY RINGS OF DEEP CONVECTION AND THE OUTFLOW IS EXCELLENT.
RAW OBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS HAVE REACHED 6.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE BUT THE

FORECAST PERIOD...MOST OF THE PARAMETERS ARE FAVORABLE FOR
STRENGTHENING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS ISAAC TO 105 KNOTS AS
SUGGESTED BY SHIPS BUT COULD STRENGTHEN FURTHER.
 
THE FORECAST IS EASIER TODAY. MODEL FORECAST TRACKS ARE TIGHTLY

SOME OBJECTIVE INTENSITY ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN IN THE 110-115 KT

THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 305/14.  THE HURRICANE IS CURRENTLY ON
THE SOUTHWESTERN SIDE OF A DEEP LAYER RIDGE...WITH A BROAD DEEP
LAYER TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND EASTERN UNITED STATES.
THIS COMBINATION SHOULD GRADUALLY RECURVE ISAAC TO THE NORTHEAST

THIS SCENARIO...WITH THE ONLY DIFFERENCES BEING ON HOW FAST IT WILL
MOVE AFTER RECURVATURE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE FOR 48 HR...AND LITTLE TO THE EAST AND FASTER THAN
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AT 72 HR.

ISAAC HAS GOOD TO EXCELLENT OUTFLOW OVER THE NORTH SEMICIRCLE AND
FAIR TO POOR OUTFLOW ELSEWHERE.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW FURTHER
STRENGTHENING WHILE IT REMAINS OVER WARM WATER.  THE CURRENT
FORECAST TRACK MOVES ISAAC INTO GRADUALLY COOLER WATER AFTER 36

HURRICANE ISAAC DISCUSSION NUMBER  30
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT THU SEP 28 2000

IT WAS NOTED EARLIER THAT THE ENVIRONMENT APPEARED FAVORABLE...AND 
SATELLITE IMAGES THIS AFTERNOON INDICATE THAT INDEED THERE HAS BEEN
FURTHER STRENGTHENING.  ENHANCED IR DATA SHOWS THAT COLDER CLOUD
TOPS HAVE WRAPPED AROUND THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE CDO.  THREE- AND
SIX-HOURLY AVERAGED OBJECTIVE T NUMBERS ARE ABOUT 6.2...WHICH
EQUATES TO A 120-KNOT...CAT. 4...CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE.  IT IS
PRESUMED THAT THE SYSTEM IS NEAR MAXIMUM STRENGTH...BUT WE WOULD NOT
BE TOO SURPRISED IF A LITTLE MORE INTENSIFICATION TOOK PLACE.  IT IS
QUITE RARE TO SEE SUCH AN INTENSE HURRICANE APPROACHING 30N
LATITUDE.  BY 48 HOURS THE HURRICANE SHOULD BE MOVING OVER SUB-26
DEG C WATERS...SO SIGNIFICANT WEAKENING IS EXPECTED LATE IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD. 

FORWARD SPEED HAS INCREASED TO 17 KNOTS OR MORE.  ISAAC CONTINUES TO
MOVE AROUND THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A DEEP-LAYER ANTICYCLONE. 
NUMERICAL GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON A GRADUAL TURN TO THE
NORTH AND NORTHEAST DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  NOT TOO MUCH
ACCELERATION IS SHOWN NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD SINCE THE GLOBAL
MODEL SHOWS THAT THE 500 MB SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING OFF THE
NORTHEAST U.S. COAST TOMORROW WILL BYPASS ISAAC.  HOWEVER IT IS
STILL BELIEVED THAT THE CYCLONE WILL BE MOVED ALONG BY THE MID-
LATITUDE WESTERLIES IN ABOUT 72 HOURS...AND SHOULD BE LOSING
TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS SOON THEREAFTER.

HURRICANE ISAAC DISCUSSION NUMBER  31
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT THU SEP 28 2000
 
HURRICANE ISAAC HAS WEAKENED SLIGHTLY BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF 115 KT FROM ALL THREE SATELLITE AGENCIES AND A 28/2132Z
SSMI OVERPASS INDICATING CONCENTRIC EYEWALLS.  TOPS HAVE ALSO WARMED
DURING THE PAST 3 HOURS...SO ISAAC PROBABLY PEAKED AT 18Z AND 00Z. 
OUTFLOW REMAINS EXCELLENT AND THE OVERALL CONVECTIVE PATTERN HAS THE
CLASSIC CIRCULAR APPEARANCE.

INITIAL MOTION IS 345/15.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR REASONING.  ISAAC APPEARS TO HAVE SLOWED
IN FORWARD SPEED...WHICH IS TYPICAL OF A TROPICAL CYCLONE AS IT
APPROACHES THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AXIS AND POINT OF RECURVATURE.
ISAAC MAY SLOW EVEN A LITTLE MORE BEFORE REACHING THE RIDGE AXIS
THAT LIES ALONG 32N-33N LATITUDE...AFTER WHICH GRADUAL ACCELERATION
IS FORECAST.  ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS AGREE ON ISAAC RECURVING TO
THE NORTHEAST IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.  THE ONLY OUTLIER IS THE UKMET
WHICH SLOWS THE FORWARD SPEED OF ISAAC BY DIGGING THE SYSTEM INTO
THE MEAN RIDGE AXIS RATHER THAN RIDING IT UP AND OVER THE RIDGE. THE
MAJORITY OF THE NHC MODEL GUIDANCE RECURVES ISAAC TO THE NORTHEAST
AND THAT SCENARIO SEEMS THE MOST REASONABLE GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF
THE APPROACHING EASTERN U.S. TROUGH.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS CLOSE TO
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST THROUGH 48 HOURS AND THEN SLIGHTLY TO THE
RIGHT BY 72 HOURS...WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE GFDL AND BAMD MODELS.
 
NOW THAT ISAAC HAS LIKELY PEAKED AND IS UNDERGOING AN EYEWALL
REPLACEMENT CYCLE...SOME WEAKENING SHOULD OCCUR.  WEAKENING IS ALSO
LIKELY SINCE ISAAC IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE MOVING OVER COOLER SSTS. 
HOWEVER...GIVEN THE IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW PATTERN...ONLY GRADUAL SLOW
WEAKENING IS FORECAST THROUGH 36 HOURS...AFTER WHICH MORE RAPID
WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS ISAAC TRACKS OVER 24C TO 22C WATER.

ISAAC CONTINUES TO SHOW SIGNS OF WEAKENING NOW THAT THE CYCLONE IS
UNDERGOING AN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLE AS SEEN IN INFRARED IMAGERY
AND IN A 29/0207Z TRMM OVERPASS.  HOWEVER...THE OVERALL CONVECTIVE
ORGANIZATION AND OUTFLOW REMAIN GOOD.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 350/17.  THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE APPEARS TO BE FLATTENING OUT IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY AND ISAAC SHOULD BEGIN TO TURN MORE TOWARD THE NORTH WITHIN
THE NEXT 12 HOURS.  RECURVATURE SHOULD OCCUR IN ABOUT 24 HOURS WITH
A GRADUAL ACCELERATION TO THE NORTHEAST AFTERWARDS.  THE LATEST
MODEL GUIDANCE IS NOW TIGHTLY CLUSTERED ALONG THE PREVIOUS TWO
FORECAST TRACKS...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS JUST AN EXTENSION OF
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL SOLUTION.  THE UKMET
MODEL IS NOW IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE AND MUCH FASTER
THAN THE PREVIOUS 2 MODEL RUNS.

GRADUAL WEAKENING IS EXPECTED NOW THAT ISAAC IS UNDERGOING AN
EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLE AND MOVING OVER COOLER WATER.  HOWEVER...
AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...ONLY GRADUAL SLOW WEAKENING
IS FORECAST THROUGH 36 HOURS DUE TO THE IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW PATTERN.
AFTERWARDS...MORE RAPID WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS ISAAC TRACKS OVER
24C TO 22C WATER.

THE 12 FT SEAS RADII WERE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BASED ON 06Z

11 AM EDT FRI SEP 29 2000

THE EYE HAS BECOME CLOUD-FILLED...AND GRADUAL WEAKENING CONTINUES. 
HOWEVER ISAAC IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A POWERFUL HURRICANE FOR ANOTHER
DAY OR SO.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST BRINGS THE SYSTEM BELOW HURRICANE
STRENGTH BY THE END OF THE PERIOD...BY WHICH TIME ISAAC IS LIKELY TO
HAVE BECOME EXTRATROPICAL.

MOTION IS NORTHWARD...IMPLYING THAT ISAAC IS CROSSING THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AXIS.  THERE ARE FEW CHANGES TO THE TRACK
FORECAST.  A GRADUAL INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED SHOULD OCCUR IN A DAY
OR SO AS THE HURRICANE STARTS BECOMING INFLUENCED BY THE MID-
LATITUDE STEERING FLOW.  THE CURRENT OFFICAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT SOMEWHAT FASTER NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD. 
THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE MODEL CONSENSUS.

WIND AND SEAS RADII FOR THIS LARGE HURRICANE HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED ON
THE BASIS OF 12Z SHIP OBSERVATIONS AND A RECENT QUIKSCAT PASS.

ISAAC IS ABOUT TO CROSS THE 27 DEG C SST ISOTHERM AND WILL BE MOVING
OVER PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATERS.  THE EYE IS BECOMING INDISTINCT

ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS...OR SOONER.

THE HEADING HAS CONTINUED TO BEND GRADUALLY TO THE RIGHT AND INITIAL
MOTION IS 010/16.  ISAAC IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY TURN TO THE

THE TROPICAL WAVE CENTERED ABOUT 800 MILES SOUTHEAST OF ISAAC HAS
CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE DAY.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 30 KT...SO ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON
TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOURTEEN.  TOPS IN THE CONVECTIVE BANDS ARE
WARMING AS THE DIURNAL MINIMUM APPROACHES...WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR
A SYSTEM AT THIS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.  STRONGER CONVECTION SHOULD
RE-DEVELOP LATER TONIGHT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/13.  ASIDE FROM ISAAC TO THE NORTHWEST...
THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT STEERING FEATURE IS A STRONG RIDGE NORTH OF
THE CYCLONE.  LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE FORECASTS THIS RIDGE TO BUILD
WESTWARD IN THE WAKE OF ISAAC.  THIS WOULD...IF THERE IS NO
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE DEPRESSION AND ISAAC...MOVE THE DEPRESSION
IN A GENERALLY WESTWARD DIRECTION.  ALL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THERE WILL
BE LITTLE OR NO INTERACTION WITH ISAAC...AND THE CURRENT TRENDS IN
MOTION OF BOTH SYSTEMS SUPPORT THIS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL GO
WITH THIS SCENARIO...CALLING FOR A GENERALLY WESTWARD MOTION OVER
THE NEXT 72 HR.  
 
THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY UNDER A RIDGE ALOFT...WITH FAIR TO GOOD
OUTFLOW IN ALL DIRECTIONS.  LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS SOME KIND
OF UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OR ANTICYCLONE WILL PERSIST OVER THE SYSTEM...
WHICH WOULD BE FAVORABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT IF THE FORECASTS VERIFY. 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL GO WITH DEVELOPMENT...TAKING THE SYSTEM
TO JUST BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 72 HR.  THERE IS A CHANCE THAT
THE SYSTEM COULD INTENSIFY MORE RAPIDLY THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST...

TROPICAL STORM JOYCE DISCUSSION NUMBER   2
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 PM EST MON SEP 25 2000
 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOURTEEN HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER
ORGANIZED AND IS NOW TROPICAL STORM JOYCE.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF
35 IS BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 35 KT FROM TAFB AND
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 10 NM DIAMETER EYE-LIKE FEATURE IN THE CENTER
OF CLOUD SYSTEM.  ALTHOUGH THE CONVECTIVE CLOUD TOPS ARE NOT
PARTICULARLY COLD...NEW CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED AROUND THE CLOUD
HOLE/EYE-LIKE FEATURE DURING THE PAST 2 HOURS.  BANDING FEATURES
HAVE ALSO IMPROVED...AND NIGHTTIME VISIBLE IMAGERY YIELDS A CLOUD
PATTERN INTENSITY CLOSE TO 45 KT.  OUTFLOW IS CONFINED MAINLY TO THE
EAST AND SOUTH OF THE CENTER.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS ABOUT 280/13. THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR REASONING...AND THE OFFICAL TRACK IS JUST
AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  SATELLITE FIXES HAVE BEEN
FALLING ON THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK AND THE LATEST MODEL GUIDANCE
CONTINUES TO INDICATE A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
THE ONLY MODELS THAT DIFFER FROM THIS SCENARIO ARE THE
AVN...GFDL...AND VBAR MODELS...WHICH TRACK JOYCE TO THE WEST-
SOUTHWEST AFTER 24 HOURS.  IT IS RARE FOR TROPICAL CYCLONES TO MOVE
SOUTH OF WEST THIS FAR EAST...AND THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF JOYCE
WILL LIKELY SHIFT SLOWLY NORTHWARD AS ISAAC MOVES MORE TOWARD THE
NORTHWEST WITH TIME.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW JOYCE TO TRACK AT LEAST A
LITTLE NORTH OF DUE WEST THROUGH THE PERIOD.

THE MAIN QUESTION IS WHAT EFEFCT WILL ANY OUTFLOW FROM ISAAC HAVE 
ON JOYCE.  THERE MAY BE SOME WEAK SUBSIDENCE ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDE
OF ISAAC THAT IS CURRENTLY INHIBITING THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLD-
TOPPED DEEP CONVECTION THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE OCCURING BY THIS TIME. 
HOWEVER...AS ISAAC PULLS FARTHER TO THE NORTH AND THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN THE TWO CYCLONES INCREASES...STRONGER CONVECTION SHOULD
DEVELOP UNLESS THE OUTFLOW FROM ISAAC INCREASES THE SHEAR ON JOYCE. 
DUE TO THIS UNCERTAINTY...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST ONLY TAKES JOYCE TO
MINIMAL CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE INTENSITY IN 72 HOURS...WHICH IS 10 KT
BELOW THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL FORECAST.

JOYCE GIVES THE APPEARANCE OF...AT BEST...A MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM. 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 30 KT FROM SAB AND KGWC...AND 35
KT FROM TAFB.  CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER IS LIMITED...NOT WELL
ORGANIZED...AND NOT VERY COLD.  MICROWAVE IMAGERY AT 0416Z FROM THE
NRL TROPICAL CYCLONE WEB PAGE INDICATES THAT THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION IS NOT ALL THAT WELL DEFINED EITHER.  THIS WOULD SUGGEST
THAT THE SYSTEM WILL INTENSIFY ONLY SLOWLY IN THE SHORT TERM. 
LONGER-TERM INTENSIFICATION WILL REQUIRE ISAAC GETTING OUT OF THE
WAY.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS LESS AGGRESSIVE THAN THE SHIPS
GUIDANCE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/12.  MOST OF THE FORECAST GUIDANCE HAS A
SOUTHWARD COMPONENT AT VARYING PARTS OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...
PERHAPS AS A RESULT OF RIDGING AS ISAAC PULLS AWAY.  GIVEN THE LACK
OF CONSISTENCY AMONG THE MODELS AS TO THE TIMING OF THE SOUTHWARD
COMPONENT...I AM GOING WITH A RELATIVELY STRAIGHT WESTWARD TRACK. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
BUT STILL ON THE SPEEDY EDGE OF THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE.

11 AM EDT TUE SEP 26 2000

VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT JOYCE IS BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED...WITH
CURVED BANDING FEATURES BECOMING QUITE PROMINENT.  DEEP CONVECTION
IS STILL NOT THAT ABUNDANT...BUT IT IS PRESENTLY ON THE INCREASE. 
CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 35 KNOTS ON THE BASIS OF A T2.5 ON THE
DVORAK SCALE FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.  GIVEN THE CURRENT ORGANIZING
TREND...A FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT...AND SUFFICIENTLY WARM
OCEAN WATERS...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  JOYCE IS EXPECTED TO
BECOME A HURRICANE LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...IF NOT SOONER.  A
SIMILAR INTENSITY PREDICTION IS SHOWN BY THE LATEST SHIPS MODEL RUN.

THE STORM CONTINUES TO MOVE AT ABOUT 275/12.  APPARENTLY A MID-
LEVEL RIDGE HAS BUILT IN BETWEEN JOYCE AND ISAAC AND IS INDUCING THE
WESTWARD MOTION.  OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE INDICATES A CONTINUED GENERALLY
WESTWARD TRACK...WITH SOME MODELS SUCH AS THE GFDL SHOWING EVEN
A LITTLE SOUTH OF WEST MOTION.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE DEEP LAYER STEERING...THE U.K. MET OFFICE...AND THE EXPERIMENTAL
FSU SUPERENSEMBLE MODEL.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL IS SOMEWHAT FASTER
TO THE WEST.

DEEP CONVECTION IS STILL LIMITED...BUT THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN
ASSOCIATED WITH JOYCE IS GRADUALLY IMPROVING.  THERE ARE PLENTY OF
CURVED BANDS...TYPICAL OF A DEVELOPING TROPICAL STORM...AND THE
OUTFLOW IS GOOD.  T-NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED TO 3.0 FROM BOTH TAFB AND
SAB.  CONSEQUENTLY...INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 45
KNOTS.  DESPITE THE CURRENT UPWARD INTENSITY TREND AND THE APPARENT
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT OF WARM OCEAN AND LOW SHEAR AHEAD...AT LEAST
THROUGH 72 HOURS...SHIPS AND GFDL INTENSITY FORECASTS ARE ABOUT 77
AND 70 KNOTS ONLY.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO SHIPS AND
MAKES JOYCE A HURRICANE IN A DAY OR TWO.

A STRONG MID-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING TO THE NORTH OF
JOYCE IS FORCING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ON A WESTWARD TRACK ABOUT 12
KNOTS. THE RIDGE IS FORECAST TO BE SO STRONG THAT SOME OF THE MODELS
HAVE A TRACK SOUTH OF DUE WEST DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS. THE
FARTHER SOUTH OF DUE WEST THE TROPICAL CYCLONE MOVES...THE MORE
DANGEROUS IT COULD BECOME FOR THE LESSER ANTILLES.  HOWEVER...MOST
GLOBAL MODELS AS WELL AS THE GFDL FORECASTS AT LONGER RANGE...OR
BEYOND 72 HOURS...INDICATE A TURN TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND
NORTHWEST BEFORE REACHING THE LESSER ANTILLES.  THE ONLY LONG RANGE
MODEL WHICH SUGGESTS A TRACK ENTERING THE CARIBBEAN IS THE UK MODEL
BUT ONLY AS A TROUGH.  WE MUST EMPHASIZE THAT FORECASTS BEYOND 72
HOURS ARE SUBJECT TO LARGE ERRORS.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS FINALLY DEVELOPED AND PERSISTED NEAR THE SYSTEM
CENTER AND A SMALL CDO HAS DEVELOPED DURING THE PAST 4 HOURS. 
ALSO...A 26/2012Z SSMI OVERPASS INDICATED A 15 NM DIAMETER BANDED
EYE FEATURE THAT WAS ABOUT 75 PERCENT CLOSED.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY
IS INCREASED TO 55 KT BASED ON THE BANDING EYE FEATURE AND A
SATELLITE CLASSIFICATION OF T3.5...OR 55 KT...FROM BOTH TAFB AND
SAB.  OUTFLOW IS GOOD TO THE WEST AND FAIR ELSEWHERE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 275/10.  THE RIDGE BETWEEN JOYCE AND
ISAAC TO THE NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP
JOYCE ON A GENERAL WESTERLY TRACK THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MAJORITY OF OUR MODEL GUIDANCE...EXCEPT FOR
THE AVN AND GFDL MODELS WHICH TAKE JOYCE WEST-SOUTHWEST FROM THE
CURRENT POSITION AND EVEN TRACK THE SYSTEM SOUTH OF 10N LATITUDE. 
THIS SEEMS EXCESSIVE AT THIS TIME AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS A LITTLE
NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND VERY CLOSE TO THE UKMET
MODEL...WHICH KEEPS JOYCE MOVING A LITTLE NORTH OF DUE WEST.
 
JOYCE MAY UNDERGO A SHORT PERIOD OF RAPID INTENSIFICATION DURING 
THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS IF THE EYE FEATURE SEEN IN THE SSMI DATA
PERSISTS THROUGH THE NIGHT.  HOWEVER...UNLIKE HURRICANE ISAAC TO 
THE NORTH...JOYCE HAS A LESS IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW PATTERN WHICH MAY
INHIBIT ANY SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT UNTIL THE CYCLONE MOVES AWAY
FROM ANY EFFECTS OF ISAAC.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS CLOSE
TO THE SHIPS MODEL WHICH BRINGS JOYCE TO 83 KT IN 72 HOURS.

JOYCE IS NEARING HURRICANE STRENGTH...WITH RECENT SATELLITE IMAGERY
SHOWING A DEVELOPING EYE SIGNATURE.  SATELLITE ESTIMATES FROM TAFB
AND SAB ARE 55 AND 65 KT...RESPECTIVELY.  THE VERY LATEST UW
OBJECTIVE ESTIMATE IS ALSO 65 KT.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS
INCREASED TO 60 KT AND JOYCE COULD BE A HURRICANE ALREADY BUT THERE
IS TIME ENOUGH TO WAIT FOR A CONSENSUS OF THE SATELLITE ESTIMATES. 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS
CLOSE TO SHIPS GUIDANCE.  NOT MUCH INTENSIFICATION IS EXPECTED GIVEN
THE CURRENT LIMITED OUTFLOW BUT JOYCE COULD SURPRISE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AS 280/12...BUT MIGHT BE EVEN
FASTER.  THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
THINKING OR TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE

MOTION IS WEST AT A SLIGHTLY FASTER FORWARD SPEED...13 KNOTS.  THE

MOTION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...BUT THERE HAS NOT
MUCH INDICATION OF A SOUTHWARD COMPONENT TO THE OBSERVED MOTION THUS

INTENSIFICATION IS CONTINUING...AND BASED ON THE LATEST DVORAK
ANALYSES FROM TAFB MIAMI AND SAB WASHINGTON THE WIND SPEED IS
ESTIMATED TO BE 75 KNOTS.  JOYCE HAS A SMALL INNER CORE AND SUCH
TROPICAL CYCLONES CAN SPIN UP RATHER FAST OR...ALTERNATIVELY...
WEAKEN FAST.  THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS STILL UNIMPRESSIVE...BUT
VERTICAL SHEAR APPEARS TO BE FAIRLY WEAK OVER THE SYSTEM AND THE
WATERS ARE WARMER THAN 28 DEGREES C.  ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST.

JOYCE CONTINUES TOWARD THE WEST.  AS NOTED EARLIER...SEVERAL OF THE
GUIDANCE MODELS HAVE BEEN INDICATING A WEST-SOUTHWEST TRACK FOR THE
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS BUT SO FAR THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE INDICATION OF
THIS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS THE WESTWARD MOTION FOR THE
NEXT FEW DAYS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GLOBAL MODEL DEPICTIONS

JOYCE CONTINUES TO INTENSIFY..WITH COLD CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER
AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 90 KT AND 77 KT FROM TAFB AND
SAB.  A TRMM PASS AT 1742Z SHOWED A PINHOLE EYE UNDER THE OVERCAST. 
A LATER SSM/I PASS DID NOT SHOW THE EYE...BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN TO
SMALL TO BE RESOLVED IN THE COARSER SSM/I DATA.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS SET TO 80 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/11.  A RIDGE IS BUILDING BETWEEN JOYCE AND
ISAAC AS THEY SEPARATE...AND THIS SHOULD CONTINUE JOYCE GENERALLY
WESTWARD FOR THE NEXT 48 HR OR SO.  AFTER THAT...THE HURRICANE MAY
TURN MORE WEST-NORTHWEST IN RESPONSE TO A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE
NORTH OF THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE ACTUALLY WANTS
TO MOVE THE CYCLONE WEST-SOUTHWEST FOR THE FIRST 24-36 HR BEFORE
TURNING WEST-NORTHWEST.  SINCE THERE IS NO SIGN OF SUCH A TURN
YET...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE
WITH A WESTWARD MOTION FOLLOWED BY A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION AT THE
END OF THE PERIOD.

JOYCE REMAINS A SMALL SYSTEM...AND AS SUCH IT COULD CHANGE STRENGTH
RATHER RAPIDLY DEPENDING ON SMALL CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT.  WIND
SHEAR ANALYSES FROM THE CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN
INDICATE LIGHT NORTHWESTERLY SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM AT THIS TIME. 
LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THAT A LARGE UPPER LEVEL LOW FORMING
OVER THE EASTERN TROPICAL ATLANTIC SHOULD MOVE WEST AND TRY TO CATCH
UP WITH JOYCE.  SHOULD IT GET CLOSE ENOUGH...THE CURRENT GENERALLY
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT COULD BECOME HOSTILE.  IT IS NOTABLE THAT NO
INTENSITY FORECAST GUIDANCE TAKES JOYCE TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS
DURING THE PERIOD.  BASED ON ALL THIS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL
TAKE JOYCE TO 95 KT IN 36 HR AND HOLD IT THERE.

THE SMALL EYE NOTED IN AN EARLIER TRMM MICROWAVE PASS IS NO LONGER
VISIBLE...AND THE IMAGERY SUGGESTS SOME WESTERLY SHEAR.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 90 KT FROM TAFB AND 77 KT FROM SAB.  GIVEN
THE DETERIORATING MICROWAVE PRESENTATION THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 80 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  

THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE 72 HOUR FORECAST FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  JOYCE SHOULD TRACK BASICALLY WESTWARD OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS.  LONGER TERM...THE FATE OF JOYCE IS EXPECTED TO TURN ON HOW
CLOSE AN APPROACH IS MADE BY THE LARGE UPPER LOW TO THE NORTHEAST OF
THE HURRICANE.  THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AVN AND
THE UKMET THIS MORNING.  THE UKMET SOLUTION IS MORE OMINOUS...IN
THAT IT BOTH KEEPS THE UPPER LOW WITH ITS ATTENDANT SHEAR FARTHER
AWAY FROM JOYCE...AND ULTIMATELY TRACKS THE CYCLONE WELL INTO THE
CARIBBEAN.  THE AVN/MRF SOLUTION BRINGS THE UPPER LOW CLOSE ENOUGH
TO JOYCE TO HINDER STRENGTHENING...AND ALSO SHOWS MORE OF A
NORTHWARD TURN SO THAT THE HURRICANE SKIRTS THE LESSER ANTILLES.  IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW AT THIS POINT WHICH SCENARIO...IF EITHER...
WILL VERIFY.  ANOTHER POSSIBILITY WOULD BE FOR THE UPPER LOW TO
PRODUCE ENOUGH SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM THAT A GREATLY WEAKENED SYSTEM
TRACKS INTO THE CARIBBEAN.

A TENTATIVE TASKING HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE NOAA GULFSTREAM JET TO FLY
SYNOPTIC SURVEILLANCE MISSIONS AHEAD OF JOYCE OVER THE WEEKEND TO

ALTHOUGH STRONG SHEAR WAS NOT ANTICIPATED...EARLY VISIBLE SATELLITE
IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE CENTER HAS BECOME PARTIALLY EXPOSED AND
IT WAS LOCATED JUST TO THE SOUTHWEST OF VERY DEEP CONVECTION.  THIS
IMPLIES SHEAR.  THE ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO BE NONDESCRIPT
BUT THE HIGH CLOUDS ARE EMANATING RADIALLY OUTWARD.  ON THE OTHER
HAND...THE AREA OF CLOUD COVERAGE IS A LITTLE LARGER THAN 24 HOURS
AGO WITH BANDING FEATURES.  T-NUMBERS HAVE DECREASED SOME... SO THE
INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 75 KNOTS. SOME FLUCTUATIONS
IN INTENSITY ARE EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS. 
THEREAFTER...JOYCE IS FORECAST TO BE UNDER UPPER-LEVEL EASTERLIES OR
LIGHT SHEAR AND STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED.  SHIPS AND GDFL ALSO
CALL FOR INTENSIFICATION.

AS SEVERAL MODELS INDICATED...MAINLY THE NCEP AVN AND THE
GFDL...JOYCE HAS BEEN MOVING WEST-SOUTHWEST AT ABOUT 12 KNOTS.  BOTH
A STRONG WESTWARD MOVING UPPER-TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN ATLANTIC AND
A RIDGE NORTH OF JOYCE ARE FORECAST TO MOVE IN TANDEM TO THE WEST. 
THIS PATTERN WOULD PROVIDE A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH 72
HOURS.  LONGER RANGE FORECASTS SUGGEST THAT THE MID TO UPPER-LEVEL
RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF JOYCE SHOULD PERSIST BUT SOMEWHAT WEAKER
...ALLOWING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO MOVE ON A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK.  
 
A NOAA GULFSTREAM JET IS SCHEDULE TO FLY SYNOPTIC SURVEILLANCE

THE CENTER IS BACK UNDER THE CONVECTION AND SOME CURVED BANDS TO THE
SOUTH HAVE DEVELOPED.  HOWEVER...THERE ARE ARC CLOUDS MOVING AWAY
FROM THE SYSTEM WHILE THE OVERALL PATTERN REMAINS NONDESCRIPT.  THIS
IN GENERAL MEANS THAT THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS NOT EXPECTED TO
STRENGTHEN THROUGH THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS.  JOYCE IS OVER WARM WATER
AND THE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS OVER THE HURRICANE ARE EXPECTED BECOME
MORE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING LATER ON. SHIPS BRINGS JOYCE TO 97
KNOTS AND THE GFDL LOWERS THE PRESSURE TO NEAR 963 MB BY DAY THREE.

JOYCE IS MOVING 255/12 WHILE IS TRAPPED BETWEEN A TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN ATLANTIC AND A RIDGE TO THE NORTH.  BECAUSE THE PATTERN IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AND MODELS HAVE NOT CHANGED...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS BASICALLY AN EXTRAPOLATION OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.

A NOAA GULFSTREAM JET IS SCHEDULE TO FLY SYNOPTIC SURVEILLANCE
MISSIONS AHEAD OF JOYCE OVER THE WEEKEND TO HELP TO DETERMINE THE
FORECAST TRACK OF THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HURRICANE. A
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE WILL NOT BE IN THE AREA OF JOYCE UNTIL SUNDAY.

HURRICANE JOYCE DISCUSSION NUMBER  14
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM AST THU SEP 28 2000
 
JOYCE WENT THROUGH A VERY STRONG CONVECTIVE BURST EARLIER THIS
EVENING...WITH A LARGE AREA OF CLOUD TOPS COLDER THAN -80C.  THE
TOPS ARE CURRENTLY WARMING.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB
AND SAB REMAIN 77 KT...SO THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY REMAINS 75 KT.

THE BURST MADE THE CENTER DIFFICULT TO LOCATE...AND THE BEST
ESTIMATE OF THE MOTION IS 260/12.  INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY
INDICATES A LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF JOYCE...WHILE WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL COLD LOW DEVELOPING WELL
TO THE NORTHEAST.  LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE RIDGE TO
THE NORTH WILL PERSIST TO SOME EXTENT FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS WHILE
THE COLD LOW MOVES WESTWARD.  FORECAST TRACK GUIDANCE RESPONDS TO
THESE FEATURES BY TAKING JOYCE WEST-SOUTHWEST FOR 12-24 HR...THEN
TURNING IT TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST OR NORTHWEST.  SINCE A NORTHWEST
MOTION TAKES JOYCE TOWARD A STRONG MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE FORECAST TO
FORM NORTH OF PUERTO RICO...IT IS UNCERTAIN WHY THE MODELS TAKE THE
STORM SO FAR NORTH.  PERHAPS SUBSIDENCE ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE OF THE
COLD LOW WILL INCREASE LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGING EAST OF JOYCE AND THUS
TURN IT NORTHWARD...BUT THE COLD LOW CIRCULATION DOES NOT YET EXTEND
FAR ENOUGH SOUTH TO DO THIS.  GIVEN THE UNCERTAINLY...THE FORECAST
TRACK WILL BE AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE IN BEST AGREEMENT
WITH THE UKMET.  IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE GFDL...GFDN...NOGAPS...
AVN...LBAR...AND VICBAR ARE ALL TO THE RIGHT OF THE CURRENT
FORECAST.  THE NHC98...NHC98UK...BAMM...AND BAMD ARE TO THE RIGHT OF
THE FORECAST.

JOYCE SHOWS GOOD RADIAL OUTFLOW IN ALL DIRECTIONS...WITH SOME
EVIDENCE OF AN OUTFLOW JET TO THE EAST.  DESPITE THIS...THE CYCLONE
IS STILL SOMEWHAT DISORGANIZED FOR ITS CURRENT INTENSITY.  LARGE
SCALE MODELS HAVE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS NEAR
JOYCE...WITH THE NOGAPS AND UKMET LOOKING GENERALLY FAVORABLE AND
THE AVN SOMEWHAT LESS SO.  THE PERSISTENT COLD TOPS CERTAINLY SHOW
THE POTENTIAL FOR STRENGTHENING...SO THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL BE
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE
STRONGER SHIPS AND THE WEAKER GFDL.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT JOYCE COULD
STRENGTHEN FASTER THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST IF IT EVER DEVELOPS A
WELL-DEFINED EYE.
 
THE NOAA GULFSTREAM JET IS SCHEDULE TO FLY SYNOPTIC SURVEILLANCE
MISSIONS AHEAD OF JOYCE OVER THE WEEKEND TO HELP TO DETERMINE THE
FORECAST TRACK OF THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HURRICANE.  A

ALTHOUGH INFRARED IMAGERY DOES NOT SHOW A WELL DEFINED CENTER...A
RECENT SSMI PASS SHOWS A SMALL EYE TYPE FEATURE.  BASED ON
THIS...THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 250/10 COMPARED TO 260/10 SIX
HOURS AGO.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS TURN THE HURRICANE TO THE
WEST-NORTHWEST OR NORTHWEST IN 72 HOURS.  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY THIS
IS SO EXCEPT THAT THE 00Z AVIATION RUN SHOWS A VERY WEAK LITTLE
TROUGH AT 500 MB NOT TOO FAR NORTH OF JOYCE IN 72 HOURS.  IN ANY
CASE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED ON THE INITIAL MOTION UNTIL 72 HOURS WHEN
THE FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE 72
HOUR FORECAST POSITION SLIGHTLY FAVORS THE UKMET WHICH HAS THE
CENTER JUST WEST OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS IN 72 HOURS.  THE GFDL AND
THE FSU EXPERIMENTAL SUGGEST THAT THE TRACK COULD COMPLETELY MISS
THE ISLANDS.  IN ANY CASE IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL ABOUT THIS.

THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS LOOKED PRETTY CRUMMY
OVERNIGHT...BUT THE LAST COUPLE OF IMAGES SHOW A SMALL CDO POSSIBLY
REDEVELOPING NEAR THE CENTER.  OTHERWISE I MIGHT HAVE DECREASED THE
CURRENT 75 KNOT WIND SPEED A LITTLE.  THE SHIPS GUIDANCE INDICATES A
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT AND BRINGS THE WINDS TO 98 KNOTS IN 72 HOURS. 
SO THE WIND SPEED FORECAST IS IDENTICAL TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

HERE WE HAVE YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF OUR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF
TROPICAL CYCLONE INTENSITY CHANGE.  MORNING VISUAL IMAGES REVEAL AN
EXPOSED LOW-LEVEL CENTER TO THE WEST OF A SMALL AND RAGGED-LOOKING
AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION...SO THE CIRCULATION HAS BECOME DECOUPLED IN
THE VERTICAL.  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY SUCH A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT
EXISTS SINCE WATER VAPOR ANIMATION DOES NOT SHOW STRONG UPPER-LEVEL
WINDS ACROSS THE CENTER OF JOYCE.  SINCE THE SYSTEM HAS BECOME SO
DISORGANIZED IT IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM.  THE
QUESTION THEN IS...WILL JOYCE RE-STRENGTHEN?  OUR BEST OBJECTIVE
INTENSITY FORECAST GUIDANCE...THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL MODEL
SHIPS...SAYS YES.  BECAUSE OF THE GUIDANCE...AND THE FACT THAT THE
ENVIRONMENT AHEAD OF THE STORM STILL APPEARS TO BE FAVORABLE...THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR AN EVENTUAL RE-INTENSIFICATION OF JOYCE
BUT NOT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE SHIPS MODEL CALLS FOR.
 
THE SOUTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION APPEARS TO BE GONE....INITIAL
HEADING IS NOW 270/12.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS ADJUSTED ONLY SLIGHTLY
NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.  OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTIONS ARE SPREAD
BETWEEN THE MORE NORTHWEST AND SLOWER MOTION SHOWN BY THE
GFDL...KEEPING JOYCE EAST OF THE LESSER ANTILLES AT 72 HOURS...TO
THE U.K. MET OFFICE MODEL WHICH MOVES THE SYSTEM INTO THE EXTREME
EASTERN CARIBBEAN.  SINCE THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A MID-LEVEL RIDGE
TO THE NORTH OF JOYCE THROUGH THE PERIOD...AND BECAUSE OF THE U.K.
MET SOLUTION...THE OFFICIAL TRACK FAVORS THE MORE WESTWARD OPTION.

THE SYSTEM REMAINS DISORGANIZED...WITH THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER
DISPLACED TO THE WEST OF THE MAIN CONVECTIVE OVERCAST.  ONE POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION FOR THE DETERIORATION OF JOYCE COULD BE STRONG LOW- TO
MID-TROPOSPHERIC EASTERLIES WHICH IS DECOUPLING THE LOW LEVEL
CENTER.  THIS IS SUGGESTED BY HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE CLOUD MOTION
VECTORS OVER THE AREA.  AS NOTED EARLIER...JOYCE IS MOVING INTO AN
ENVIRONMENT THAT APPEARS TO BE FAVORABLE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF
UPPER-LEVEL WINDS INFERRED FROM WATER VAPOR ANIMATION.  ANALYSES
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS ALSO SHOW WEAK VERTICAL SHEAR
IN THE VICINITY OF THE LESSER ANTILLES.  HOWEVER...SO FAR JOYCE IS
NOT RECOVERING FROM ITS EARLIER DISORGANIZATION.  IN VIEW OF THE
LATTER...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST DOES NOT SHOW MUCH
STRENGTHENING FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  LATER ON...JOYCE IS FORECAST
TO REGAIN HURRICANE STATUS.  HOWEVER THAT PREDICTION SHOULD BE
VIEWED AS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.

INITIAL MOTION IS A LITTLE FASTER...270/14.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE.  GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A DEEP LAYER MEAN
RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF JOYCE WHICH SHOULD MAINTAIN A WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWEST MOTION.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE LATEST
AVN MODEL RUN.  IN A LIMITED SAMPLE...THAT MODEL HAS BEEN AN
OUTSTANDING PERFORMER FOR JOYCE THUS FAR.

A TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE WATCH WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED FOR
BARBADOS SOON.

TROPICAL STORM JOYCE HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN SLIGHTLY AND THE
INITIAL INTENSITY OF 45 KT IS BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF 45 TO 50 KT FROM ALL THREE SATELLITE AGENCIES.  THE
OUTFLOW IS FAIR TO GOOD TO THE NORTH AND POOR ELSEWHERE.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/13.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FORWARD SPEED AND DIRECTION THE PAST 12 HOURS...
BUT THE GENERAL TREND HAS BEEN WESTWARD.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND
30/00Z UPPER-AIR OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THE NORTH AND NORTHEASTERLY
MID-LEVEL SHEAR THAT HAS CAUSED JOYCE TO WEAKEN AND TRACK 
WEST-SOUTHWEST THE PAST 2 DAYS MAY BE LETTING UP.  THERE REMAINS
CONSIDERABLE DIVERGENCE AMONG THE MODEL FORECASTS WITH NOGPAPS BEING
THE FARTHEST NORTH NEAR ANTIGUA AND CLIPER BEING THE FARTHEST WEST
AND SOUTH NEAR COLOMBIA.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE
GFDL...AVN...AND GUNS MODELS...AND FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO BUT SLOWER THAN THE UKMET MODEL WHICH
TAKES JOYCE FASTER AND INTO THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN IN 72 HOURS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS LESS STRAIGHTFORWARD.  AS LONG AS JOYCE
REMAINS IN A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT...LITTLE IF ANY INTENSIFICATION
SHOULD OCCUR.  HOWEVER...BY 24 HOURS...ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS
AGREE ON THE AFOREMENTIONED MID-LEVEL SHEAR DECREASING SIGNIFICANTLY
AS THE DEEP MID-OCEANIC TROUGH TO THE NORTHEAST OF JOYCE WEAKENS AND
PULLS AWAY TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST.  JOYCE HAS A VERY DEEP AND
WELL-ORGANIZED VERTICAL CIRCULATION...GIVEN THAT JOYCE HAS SURVIVED
SOME VERY HOSTILE SHEAR CONDITIONS THE PAST 2 DAYS.  AS A
RESULT...RE-INTENSIFICATION TO HURRICANE INTENSITY COULD OCCUR
QUICKLY ONCE THE SHEAR LETS UP ON THE CYCLONE.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL...WHICH BRINGS
JOYCE TO 82 KT IN 72 HOURS.
 
SINCE JOYCE IS FORECAST TO BE A STRONG TROPICAL STORM JUST SOUTHEAST
OF BARBADOS IN 36 HOURS...A TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE
ISSUED FOR BARBADOS BY SATURDAY MORNING.

THIS MORNINGS VISIBLE PICTURES SHOW THAT JOYCE HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN
ORGANIZATION FROM 24 HOURS AGO.  THE STORM REMAINS QUITE
DISORGANIZED WITH THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER TO THE WEST OF THE MAIN AREA
OF DEEP CONVECTION.  THE SHEARING...WHICH IS APPARENTLY BEING

WESTERLIES...HAS NOT ABATED SO FAR.   CURRENT INTENSITY IS ADJUSTED

RE-INTENSIFICATION AT THIS TIME...LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS
FORECAST FOR THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  LATER ON...SOME INTENSIFICATION
MAY OCCUR...BUT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NOT AS AGRESSIVE AS THE
SHIPS MODEL.  THAT MODEL HAS BEEN INSISTENT ON THE STRENGTHENING OF
JOYCE...BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS NOT VERIFIED SO FAR.

MOTION IS FASTER TOWARD THE WEST...275/16.  BASED ON THIS...THE

A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION HAS OCCURRED NEAR THE CENTER...BUT THERE
IS LITTLE OR NO EVIDENCE OF BANDING FEATURES.  OVERALL THE SYSTEM
REMAINS VERY DISORGANIZED AND THE MAXIMUM WIND ESTIMATE IS KEPT AT
MARGINAL STORM STRENGTH.  HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WE HAVE
SEEN A NUMBER OF CASES OF RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT-LOOKING SYSTEMS
IN WHICH RATHER STRONG WINDS WERE FOUND.  AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE
HUNTER PLANE WILL INVESTIGATE JOYCE LATE TONIGHT TO GIVE A MORE
PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF INTENSITY.  BOTH THE SHIPS MODEL AND ANALYSES
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS SHOW WEAK SHEAR IN THE
VICINITY OF JOYCE.  HOWEVER AS BEFORE...BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE OF
THE SYSTEM IS NOT VERY HEALTHY...NOT MUCH INCREASE IN STRENGTH IS
PREDICTED UNTIL LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

AS NEW CONVECTION DEVELOPS NEAR THE CENTER...THERE IS MORE COUPLING
WITH THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVELS AND THIS MAY CAUSE SOME SLOWING OF THE
EFFECTIVE STEERING FLOW.  SHORT-TERM MOTION HAS SLOWED FROM 16-18
KNOTS EARLIER TODAY TO ABOUT 14 KNOTS.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS ABOUT
THE SAME AS BEFORE BUT SLIGHTLY DELAYS THE TIMING OF JOYCES PASSAGE
OVER THE WINDWARDS.  GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE
REMAINING NORTH OF JOYCE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THEREFORE A WEST-
TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE...TAKING JOYCE INTO THE
CENTRAL CARIBBEAN AROUND THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

THIS OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST NCEP

A FEW BURSTS OF DEEP CONVECTION DEVELOPED NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE
SYSTEM EARLIER...BUT HAVE SINCE WEAKENED.  SOME NEW BANDING FEATURES
MAY BE TRYING TO DEVELOP EAST AND WEST OF THE CIRCULATION CENTER AND 
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 40 KT BASED ON A SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 45 KT FROM ALL THREE SATELLITE AGENCIES. 
HOWEVER...THE INTENSITY WAS HELD DOWN SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE OVERALL
CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION LOOKING SOMEWHAT RAGGED.  A RECON AIRCRAFT
WILL BE OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE SYSTEM AROUND 06Z.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/12.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICNAT
CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR REASONING.  THE NEW MODEL
GUIDANCE IS TIGHTLY CLUSTERED AROUND THE PREVIOUS TRACK...SO THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS JUST AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST. THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH IS EXPECTED TO
STRENGTHEN THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...WHICH SHOULD KEEP JOYCE ON
A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK.

ALL OF THE INTENSITY MODELS AGREE ON JOYCE STRENGTHENING IN ABOUT 
18 TO 24 HOURS.  THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THE NORTHERLY MID-LEVEL SHEAR
THAT STILL HAS NOT LET UP.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THE MID-
LEVEL NORTH AND NORTHEASTERLY FLOW IS UNDERCUTTING THE CIRRUS
OUTFLOW LAYER.  HOWEVER...THE LATEST 01/00Z UPPER-AIR OBSERVATIONS
FROM THE LESSER ANTILLES INDICATE THE MID-LEVEL FLOW IS MORE
EASTERLY... WHICH SHOULD HELP TO LESSEN THE SHEAR ONCE JOYCE REACHES
THE WINDWARD ISLANDS BY LATE SUNDAY.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL
TAKES JOYCE UP TO 83 KT IN 72 HOURS...BUT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
LOWER DUE TO THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN THE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS FROM THE
EAST AT 30 KT BY 48 HOURS ACROSS THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN SEA.

TROPICAL STORM JOYCE DISCUSSION NUMBER  23
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SUN OCT 01 2000
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT SOME DEEP CONVECTION HAS
REDEVELOPED NEAR THE SYSTEM CENTER WITH SOME BANDS TO THE EAST. AIR
FORCE RECON AIRCRAFT HAD A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING THE BROAD
CIRCULATION CENTER...BUT THEY MADE A SECOND PASS THROUGH THE EAST
SIDE AND FOUND AT LEAST 34 KT AT 1500 FT.  BASED ON THE RECON WIND
REPORT AND INCREASE IN CONVECTION...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS KEPT AT
MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH...MAINLY IN SQUALLS TO THE EAST.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/15.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT
CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR REASONING.  THE NEW MODEL
GUIDANCE REMAINS TIGHTLY CLUSTERED AROUND THE PREVIOUS TWO FORECAST
TRACKS...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS JUST AN EXTENSION OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST.  THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH IS EXPECTED
TO GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...WHICH SHOULD
KEEP JOYCE ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK.  AFTER 48 HOURS...SOME
OF THE MODELS INDICATE A MORE WESTWARD TRACK AND THIS SEEMS
REASONABLE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF NORTHERLY OUTFLOW ACROSS THE CENTRAL
CARIBBEAN SEA FROM HURRICANE KEITH.
 
THE INTENSITY MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW SOME STRENGTHENING IN ABOUT
24 HOURS.  THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO BE THE NORTHERLY MID-LEVEL SHEAR
AS INDICATED IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.  HOWEVER...THERE IS AN UPPER-
LEVEL LOW TO THE WEST OF JOYCE THAT HAS BEEN AIDING THE OUTFLOW TO
THE NORTH.  THIS LOW IS FORECAST TO MOVE WITH JOYCE...WHICH MAY
ALLOW THE CYCLONE TO INTENSIFY ONCE JOYCE GETS INTO THE EASTERN
CARIBBEAN.  THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF THE NORTHERLY OUTFLOW
FROM KEITH WILL AFFECT JOYCE.  MOST OF THE MODELS GRADUALLY TURN THE
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW FROM NORTHERLY TO NORTHEASTERLY AFTER 36 HOURS...
WHICH MAY HELP TO KEEP THE STRONG SHEAR OFF OF JOYCE.

SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
JOYCE HAS IMPROVED SINCE YESTERDAY.  THERE ARE BANDING FEATURES...
DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND THE OUTFLOW HAS BECOME A LITTLE
BETTER ORGANIZED.  SURFACE DATA FROM THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN ISLANDS
INDICATE THAT THE CIRCULATION AND THE AREA OF MINIMUM PRESSURE MOVED
VERY NEAR OR TO THE NORTH OF TOBAGO.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS KEPT AT
35 KNOTS AND NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS ANTICIPATED TODAY. IF JOYCE
SURVIVES...A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST PRIMARILY BY THE END
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD WHEN JOYCE REACHES THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN.

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14. A WELL ESTABLISHED MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE
IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC TO THE NORTH OF
JOYCE. THIS PATTERN SHOULD FAVOR A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK
THROUGH 72 HOURS.  IN FACT...TRACK MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT. 
IF JOYCE SURVIVES ITS PATH THROUGH THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN...ANOTHER
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TROPICAL CYCLONE COULD BE IN THE WESTERN
CARIBBEAN IN A FEW DAYS.

AN AIR FORCE PLANE WILL INVESTIGATE JOYCE LATER TODAY.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION JOYCE DISCUSSION NUMBER  25
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SUN OCT 01 2000
 
JOYCE IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME. THE
REASONS ARE THAT THE SATELLITE PRESENTATION IS NOT GOOD AS THIS
MORNING AND CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER HAS DECREASED...ALTHOUGH SOME
BANDING FEATURES ARE REFORMING.  THE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE FOUND A
WELL DEFINED AND LARGE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION...IN FACT... BETTER 
ESTABLISHED THAN IN THE PREVIOUS FLIGHT.  HOWEVER...THE MINIMUM
PRESSURE IS ABOUT 1008 MB ONLY AND THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF TROPICAL
STORM FORCE WINDS NEAR THE CENTER.  THE FEW REPORTS FROM THE PLANE
OF 40 KNOT WINDS ARE WELL TO THE EAST IN RAINBANDS AND ARE IN
AGREEMENT WITH REPORTS FROM BARBADOS OF TROPICAL STORM WIND GUSTS
FOR SEVERAL HOURS.
 
THE OUTFLOW HAS IMPROVED AND I WOULD DARE TO SAY THAT IT IS
FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING.  HOWEVER...TROPICAL DEPRESSION JOYCE IS
ABOUT TO MOVE INTO THE AREA WHICH THE OLD TIMERS CALL THE HURRICANE
GRAVEYARD.  HISTORICALLY...WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS... TROPICAL
CYCLONES DO NOT DEVELOP IN THIS AREA OF THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN.  
THEREFORE...JOYCE IS KEPT AT 30 KNOTS THROUGH 48 HOURS. 
THEREAFTER...SOME STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED WHEN THE DEPRESSION
REACHES THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN...IF IT SURVIVES.  MOST OF THE
INTENSITY GUIDANCE IMMEDIATELY RESTRENGTHEN JOYCE BUT THAT IT IS NOT
LIKELY AT THIS TIME.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14.  A WELL ESTABLISHED MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE
IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC TO THE NORTH OF
JOYCE.  THIS PATTERN SHOULD FAVOR A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS.

LATEST QUICKSCAT WINDS SHOW ONLY 20 TO 25 KNOTS WINDS AND SUGGEST
THAT THE SYSTEM MAY NOW BE A TROPICAL WAVE. TAFB AND AIR FORCE
GLOBAL ARE STILL CLASSIFYING JOYCE AS A 45 KNOT SYSTEM AND SAB AS A
30 KNOT SYSTEM.  SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE ISLANDS ARE IN THE 15
TO 20 KNOT RANGE.  FOR THIS PACKAGE I AM KEEPING JOYCE AT 30 KNOTS. 

DURING THE PAST SIX HOURS DEEP CONVECTION HAS INCREASED EAST OF THE
BROAD LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER.  THE OUTFLOW HAS NOT CHANGED IN
THE PAST SIX HOURS AND APPEARS TO REMAIN FAVORABLE FOR
STRENGTHENING.  HOWEVER...AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS
DISCUSSION...TROPICAL DEPRESSION JOYCE IS NOW MOVING INTO THE AREA
OF THE CARIBBEAN WHERE TROPICAL CYCLONES... HISTORICALLY DO NOT
DEVELOP. THEREFORE...JOYCE IS KEPT AT 30 KNOTS THROUGH 48 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...SOME STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED WHEN THE DEPRESSION
REACHES THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN.
  
A WELL ESTABLISHED MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE
OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC TO THE NORTH OF JOYCE.  INITIAL MOTION IS
285/13.  ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS TAKE THE SYSTEM TOWARD THE
WESTNORTHWEST THROUGH 72 HOURS... EXCEPT FOR THE AVIATION
MODEL...WHICH MOVES THE SYSTEM ON A MORE NORTHWEST TRACK THAT BRINGS
THE SYSTEM SOUTH OF CENTRAL CUBA IN 72 HOURS.  HPC FEELS THAT THIS
MAY BE DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF HURRICANE KEITH IN THE MODEL.  AT
THIS TIME WE WILL IGNORE THIS PARTICULAR TRACK SOLUTION. THE
OFFICIAL TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

AN ECLIPSE PERIOD FOR GOES-8 SATELLITE FROM 0300 TO 0630 UTC HAS
MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE A CENTER FOR JOYCE. 
ALSO...SURFACE OBS ARE SPARSE AND THERE IS NO RECENT QUICKSCAT PASS.

BASED UPON THE 0645 UTC PICTURE...WITH AIR FORCE GLOBAL IN BETWEEN. 
ALL POSITIONS ARE BELOW 12 DEGREES NORTH.  THEREFORE...I AM LEANING
HEAVILY ON PERSISTENCE FOR THE INITIAL POSITION.  
 
IT APPEARS THAT THE DEEP CONVECTION IS NOW ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE

APPEARS FAVORABLE FOR SOME DEVELOPMENT.  HOWEVER...AS MENTIONED IN

SATELLITE IMAGES DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS INDICATE THAT THE AREA OF
DISTURBED WEATHER IN THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN HAS GRADUALLY BECOME
BETTER ORGANIZED.  AN AIR FORCE PLANE INVESTIGATED THE SYSTEM AND
CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF A CIRCULATION WITH 32-KNOT WINDS WITH A
MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 1004 MB.  BASED ON THIS INFORMATION...THE SYSTEM
HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION FIFTEEN AT THIS TIME.

THE DEPRESSION HAS AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND SOME CURVED BANDS BUT
CONVECTION IS NOT VERY WELL ORGANIZED YET.  A SLOW STRENGTHENING IS
INDICATED AND THE DEPRESSION WILL LIKELY BECOME A TROPICAL STORM IN
THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO. THIS
FORECAST IS HEAVILY BASED ON SHIPS MODEL.

THE DEPRESSION HAS BEEN MOVING LITTLE AND NO SIGNIFICANT MOTION IS
INDICATED DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.  A SLOW NORTHWEST DRIFT IS
EXPECTED THEREAFTER.  LATEST AVN AND UK MODEL RUNS BASICALLY KEEP
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE OVER THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN THROUGH 72
HOURS.
 
ALTHOUGH NO WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE ISSUED AT THIS TIME...ALL
INTEREST IN THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS
OF THIS SYSTEM.  TORRENTIAL RAINS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR OVER PORTIONS
OF CENTRAL AMERICA...PRIMARILY OVER NORTHEASTERN HONDURAS.

AS OFTEN OCCURS WITH A TROPICAL CYCLONE AT THIS STAGE OF
DEVELOPMENT... CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH TROPICAL DEPRESSION
FIFTEEN HAS DECREASED DURING THE EVENING.  GIVEN THIS AND SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 30 KT AND 25 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB...THE
MAXIMUM WINDS WILL REMAIN 25 KT.  IT IS LIKELY THAT CONVECTION WILL
INCREASE AFTER 06Z AS THE CYCLONE STARTS INTO THE NEXT DIURNAL
MAXIMUM.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL POSITION IS A LITTLE WEST OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE SATELLITE FIXES IS LARGER THAN ANY
LIKELY MOTION OF THE CYCLONE...SO THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL
MOTION IS STATIONARY.  THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY ISOLATED FROM ANY
MAJOR STEERING INFLUENCES...AND LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT
WILL NOT CHANGE IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.  AFTER 36 HR OR SO...A
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL START FORMING OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN
U.S....AND THIS MAY CHANGE THE STEERING FLOW ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME
NORTHWARD OR NORTH-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION.  ALL GUIDANCE...EXCEPT THE
GFDL WHICH LOOPS THE CYCLONE INTO HONDURAS...CALLS FOR A SLOW NORTH
TO NORTH-NORTHWEST DRIFT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS
THIS...BEING A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND A LITTLE
SLOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF THE GUIDANCE.

CIRRUS CLOUD MOTIONS SUGGESTS AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS OVER THE
DEPRESSION...AND LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THIS SHOULD PERSIST
OVER THE SYSTEM THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THUS GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS IDENTICAL TO
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE WITH A SLIGHTLY SLOWER RATE OF STRENGTHENING
THAN THE SHIPS MODEL.
 
ALTHOUGH NO WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE ISSUED AT THIS TIME...ALL
INTEREST IN THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS
OF THIS SYSTEM.  TORRENTIAL RAINS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR OVER PORTIONS

SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOW THE DEPRESSION
CONSISTS OF A LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION WITH SOME BANDING FEATURES
BUT LACKS AN INNER CORE AT THIS TIME.  ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES
CONTINUE TO FALL OVER THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN AND UPPER-LEVEL
WINDS ARE ON THE FAVORABLE SIDE FOR STRENGTHENING.  IN FACT...SHIPS
AND GFDL MODELS INTENSIFY THE DEPRESSION TO HURRICANE STATUS. 
FURTHERMORE...GFDL LONG RANGE RUNS MAKE THE DEPRESSION A POWERFUL
HURRICANE IN THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN AS IT CROSSES WESTERN CUBA.
HOWEVER...ALL INTENSITY FORECASTS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN EVEN FOR 12
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING
ONLY.  A HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE WILL BE IN THE AREA TO DETERMINE THE
INTENSITY LATER TODAY.

THE DEPRESSION IS DRIFTING TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHWEST AND A SLOW
TRACK TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST AND NORTH IS EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT
72 HOURS.  GUIDANCE SHOWS TRACKS IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THEY VARY ALL
THE WAY FROM YUCATAN TO WESTERN CUBA BUT IN SUMMARY...IT PROBABLY
MEANS THAT THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL REMAIN OVER THE NORTHWESTERN
CARIBBEAN THROUGH 72 HOURS.

THIS LARGE SYSTEM IS BRINGING MOIST LOW-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW
FROM THE EASTERN PACIFIC TO CENTRAL AMERICA.  NORMALLY...THIS
PATTERN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TORRENTIAL RAINS OVER CENTRAL AMERICA AND
PREVENTIVE ACTIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN.

DUE TO THE SLOW MOTION OF THE DEPRESSION AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE

DATA FROM AN AIR FORCE PLANE INDICATE THAT TROPICAL DEPRESSION
FIFTEEN REACHED TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  THIS IS BASED ON REPORTS
OF 53-KNOT WINDS AT FLIGHT LEVEL AND A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 995 MB.
SATELLITE IMAGERY ALSO SHOWS THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS GRADUALLY

KEITH CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED...WITH A STRONG
CONVECTIVE BAND WRAPPING ROUGHLY THREE-FOURTHS OF THE WAY AROUND THE
CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 45 KT...45 KT...AND 35 KT
FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA.  THE MAXIMUM WINDS WILL REMAIN 45 KT FOR
THIS ADVISORY.  THE NEXT AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT
WILL ARRIVE AT KEITH BETWEEN 05Z-06Z.

THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 320/4.  KEITH REMAINS CUT
OFF FROM STRONG STEERING INFLUENCES AT THE MOMENT.  A SURFACE RIDGE
IS OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO...WHILE PRESSURES ARE LOWER OVER THE
CENTRAL CARIBBEAN AND THE BAHAMAS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES AN
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DIGGING INTO THE NORTHEASTERN AND CENTRAL GULF OF
MEXICO...WITH AN ASSOCIATED NON-TROPICAL SURFACE LOW FORMING JUST
SOUTHEAST OF MIAMI.  MOST NHC TRACK GUIDANCE...INCLUDING THE
UKMET...RESPONDS TO THIS PATTERN BY CLUSTERING BY CONTINUING THE
CURRENT MOTION.  HOWEVER...THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OUTLIERS.  THE
NOGAPS TAKES KEITH WESTWARD INTO THE BAY OF CAMPECHE...WHICH IS
POSSIBLE IF THE TROUGH TO THE NORTH BY-PASSES THE STORM.  THE GFDN
MEANDERS IT WESTWARD TOWARD BELIZE.  THE LBAR AND VICBAR TAKE KEITH
MORE QUICKLY TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST...WITH VICBAR SHOWING
LANDFALL NEAR TAMPA IN 72 HR.  THESE POSITIONS WOULD LIKELY BE WEST
OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH...WHICH CASTS DOUBT ON IF THEY WOULD
VERIFY AND HOW MUCH OF KEITH WOULD REMAIN IF THEY DID.  THE GFDL IS
AN EXTREME OUTLIER...FORECASTING A LOOP AND THEN MOVING KEITH
NORTHWARD TOWARD SOUTH FLORIDA.  WHILE THIS COULD HAPPEN IF KEITH
AND THE TROUGH TO THE NORTH INTERACT...THE GFDL HAS LACKED
RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY.  SINCE THERE ARE NO CURRENT SIGNS THAT THE
OUTLIERS ARE COMING TRUE...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE OF THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE...DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAIN GUIDANCE CLUSTER AND
A LITTLE SLOWER.

KEITH SHOWS GOOD OUTFLOW...AND A SMALL UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BETWEEN IT
AND YUCATAN HAS PROBABLY HELPED IT MORE THAN HURT IT.  LARGE-SCALE
GUIDANCE SUGGESTS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OR ANTICYCLONE WILL REMAIN
OVER THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN THROUGH 72 HR...AND KEITH SHOULD
STRENGTHEN AS LONG AS IT REMAINS UNDER THAT FEATURE.  THE GFDU
BRINGS KEITH TO OVER 100 KT BY 72 HR AND SHIPS BRINGS IT TO 89 KT. 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL BE SOMEWHAT MORE CONSERVATIVE IN CASE
KEITH MOVES OVER YUCATAN...OR MORE QUICKLY INTO A LESS FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO.
 
THIS LARGE SYSTEM IS BRINGING MOIST LOW-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW
FROM THE EASTERN PACIFIC TO CENTRAL AMERICA.  NORMALLY...THIS
PATTERN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TORRENTIAL RAINS OVER CENTRAL AMERICA AND
PREVENTIVE ACTIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN.
 
DUE TO THE SLOW MOTION AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FORECAST...ALL
INTERESTS IN THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN SHOULD MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF KEITH.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SAT SEP 30 2000
 
TROPICAL STORM KEITH HAS BECOME MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED AND A RECENT
RECON FLIGHT FOUND 850 MB WINDS OF 67 KT IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT
AND A PRESSURE OF 985 MB.  BASED ON THIS DATA...THE INTENSITY HAS
BEEN INCREASED TO 60 KT...JUST BELOW MINIMAL HURRICANE STRENGTH.
OUTFLOW IS EXCELLENT IN THE EAST SEMICIRCLE AND FAIR ELSEWHERE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/6 BASED ON RECENT RECON FIXES. 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY AT THIS POINT IN TIME IF THIS IS A TRUE
MOTION VECTOR OR MAINLY DUE TO RE-DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM CENTER. 
MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE TAKES KEITH NORTHWEST OR NORTHWARD IN
ABOUT 6 TO 12 HOURS...EXCEPT FOR NOGAPS WHICH TAKES KEITH WEST AND
SOUTHWEST.  THE STEERING CURRENTS APPEAR TO BE WEAK BASED ON 30/00Z
UPPER-AIR DATA.  HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A SMALL
UPPER-LEVEL LOW HAS PINCHED OFF TO THE WEST AND DROPPED SOUTH TO
BELIZE OVERNIGHT. THIS SMALL LOW MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WESTWARD
JOG THAT KEITH HAS MADE. THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW LONG WILL THIS
MOTION LAST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS
TRACK AND TAKES KEITH NORTHWEST AND THEN NORTH ACROSS THE NORTHEAST
PORTION OF THE YUCATAN AND INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. THIS
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GFDL...AVN...AND UKMET MODELS.
 
BASED ON THE EXPECTED SLOW MOTION AND IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW PATTERN...
A CLIMATOLOGICAL AVERAGE INTENSIFICATION RATE OF ONE DVORAK T-
NUMBER PER DAY UNTIL EXPECTED LANDFALL OCCURS...WHICH IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL.
 
THIS LARGE SYSTEM IS BRINGING MOIST LOW-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW
FROM THE EASTERN PACIFIC TO CENTRAL AMERICA...WHICH MAY CAUSE
TORRENTIAL RAINS OVER CENTRAL AMERICA AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS SHOULD
BE TAKEN.
 
DUE TO THE SLOW MOTION AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FORECAST...ALL

SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATE THAT KEITH IS MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED WITH
AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND BANDING FEATURES.  IT APPEARS TO BE
DEVELOPING AN EYE WHILE T-NUMBERS SUPPORT HURRICANE STATUS AT THIS
TIME. A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE WILL MEASURE THE INTENSITY OF KEITH IN

DERIVED GFDL WHICH TAKES KEITH WESTWARD...SUGGEST THAT KEITH SHOULD
BEGIN TO MOVE SLOWLY TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH. ON THIS
TRACK...KEITH SHOULD CROSS THE EASTERN YUCATAN PENINSULA AND EMERGE
OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO BY 72 HOURS.

HOWEVER...THE MEMORY OF HURRICANE MITCH IS STILL VIVID WHEN ALL

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SAT SEP 30 2000
 
KEITH IS BECOMING A LARGE AND DANGEROUS HURRICANE.  DATA FROM A
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT KEITH IS STRENGTHENING. THE
MINIMUM PRESSURE DROPPED TO 970 MB...FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS AT 850 MB
REACHED 98 KNOTS FROM THE NORTHWEST AND DVORAK T-NUMBERS...
OBJECTIVES AND SUBJECTIVE ARE INCREASING.  ALTHOUGH 98 KNOTS AT
FLIGHT LEVEL CORRESPOND TO 80 KNOTS AT THE SURFACE....THE INITIAL
INTENSITY HAS BEEN SET AT 85 KNOTS ASSUMING THAT SOME STRENGTHENING
HAS OCCURRED SINCE THE PLANE SAMPLED THE AREA OF MAXIMUM WINDS AND
AS SUGGESTED BY OBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS.
 
THE HURRICANE IS OVER A TREMENDOUS RESERVOIR OF WARM WATER OR LARGE
HEAT CONTENT AND THE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS SEEM IDEAL FOR STRENGTHENING
AT THIS TIME.  THE EFFECT OF LAND IS THE ONLY APPARENT INHIBITOR
FACTOR. IN ADDITION...EVERY AVAILABLE INTENSITY GUIDANCE INTENSIFIES
KEITH. THEREFORE...FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST ALTHOUGH MANY
TIMES...INTENSITY FORECAST TURN OUT TO BE WRONG ONE WAY OR THE
OTHER.
 
KEITH HAS BEEN MOVING VERY LITTLE... AND SO FAR...THIS HAS BEEN AN
OUTSTANDING JOB DONE BY THE GFDL AND THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL. IN
FACT...THE GFDL SUGGESTED A SMALL LOOP AND THE HURRICANE APPEARS TO
BE DOING SO AT THIS TIME.  TRACK GUIDANCE INCLUDING GLOBAL MODELS...
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NOGAPS AND ITS DERIVED GFDL WHICH TAKES KEITH
WESTWARD...SUGGEST THAT THE HURRICANE SHOULD BEGIN TO MOVE SLOWLY
TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHWEST OVER THE EASTERN PORTION OF YUCATAN OR
THE YUCATAN CHANNEL AND THEN INTO THE SOUTHERN GULF OF MEXICO.
LATEST LONG RANGE GFDL MODEL RUN MAKES KEITH AN EVEN STRONGER
HURRICANE IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

THE CENTER HAS BEEN DRIFTING WESTWARD AND THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 270/02.  THE GUIDANCE IS CHANGED LITTLE FROM SIX HOURS
AGO WITH THE AVIATION MODEL SHOWING KEITH IN A COL REGION BETWEEN
ANTICYLONES TO THE WEST AND EAST AND A WEAK TROUGH JUST NORTH AT 500
MB.  THE GFDL AND AVIATION MODEL MOVE KEITH MOSTLY NORTHWARD
THROUGH THE YUCATAN CHANNEL...THE UKMET IS A LITTLE FURTHER WEST
OVER THE EASTERN YUCATAN PENINSULA...AND THE NOGAPS CONTINUES TO
MOVE
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS BELIZE AND INTO THE BAY OF CAMPECHE IN 72
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY MOVING KEITH ACROSS THE EASTERN YUCATAN...EXCEPT THAT THE
HEADING IS A LITTLE MORE NORTHWARD.  REGARDLESS OF THE EXACT HEADING
THAT KEITH TAKES...HURRICANE WINDS AND STORM SURGE SHOULD SHORTLY
AFFECT MUCH OF THE EASTERN YUCATAN PENINSULA.  AND IF THE WESTWARD
DRIFT CONTINUES FOR MUCH LONGER...NORTHERN BELIZE COULD ALSO
EXPERIENCE HURRICANE WINDS.
 
THE LAST RECON FIX AT 21Z GAVE 966 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE AND THE MAX
FLIGHT LEVEL WIND AT 850 MB WAS 101 KNOTS.  THIS IS A DROP OF 11 MB
IN 3 HOURS.  A DROPSONDE SHOWED WINDS TO 120 KNOTS NEAR 900 MB
DECREASING TO 87 KNOTS JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE.  SINCE THEN SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES HAVE INCREASED TO THE 100 TO 115 KNOT RANGE.
BASED ON THE ABOVE...THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 100 KNOTS FOR
THE 03Z ADVISORY AND FORECAST TO 110 KNOTS IN 12 HOURS.  THE
STRENGHTENING IS MOST IMPRESSIVE CONSIDERING THAT SOME 25 PERCENT OF
THE CIRCULATION IS ALREADY OVER LAND.  SINCE THE FORECAST TRACK HAS
THE CENTER NEAR OR OVER THE EASTERN YUCATAN PENINSULA AT 24 TO 48
HOURS...SOME WEAKENING IS FORECAST AFTER 12 HOURS FOLLOWED BY
STRENGTHENING AGAIN AT 72 HOURS WHEN THE CENTER IS FORECAST TO BE
WELL AWAY FROM LAND IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SUN OCT 01 2000

KEITH HAS A SPECTACULAR APPEARANCE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...WITH A
WELL-DEFINED 15-20 N MI DIAMETER EYE.  AIR FORCE RECON FOUND A
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 942 MB AND...FROM A GPS DROPWINDSONDE...
A MEAN WIND OF 140 KNOTS OVER THE LOWEST 150 METERS IN THE SOUTHERN
PORTION OF THE EYEWALL.  THIS REDUCES TO A SURFACE WIND SPEED NEAR
115 KNOTS.  KEITH IS NOW A CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE AND A LITTLE MORE
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR TODAY IF THE INNER CORE REMAINS OVER
WATER.  HOWEVER SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY CAN BE EXPECTED...DUE
TO EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES WHICH ARE COMMON IN INTENSE
HURRICANES.  WEAKENING WILL OCCUR WHEN THE CENTER MOVES OVER
YUCATAN.  ASSUMING THE CENTER REACHES THE GULF OF MEXICO...
RESTRENGTHENING MAY BE LIMITED BY INCREASED SHEAR AND/OR DRIER AIR.

RECON FIXES SHOW A SLOW ERRATIC MOTION...SO KEITH REMAINS IN A WEAK
STEERING CURRENT AT THIS TIME.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS THE
SYSTEM IN A MID-TROPOSPHERIC COL BETWEEN A WEAK RIDGE OVER THE
NORTHWEST GULF REGION AND A RIDGE TO THE EAST-NORTHEAST.  THE GLOBAL
MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE EASTERN RIDGE WILL BE THE SLIGHTLY MORE
DOMINANT ONE IN A FEW DAYS TIME...AND PRODUCE A NORTH-NORTHWEST
MOTION WHICH WOULD MOVE KEITH OVER EASTERN YUCATAN AND EVENTUALLY
INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE MOSTLY
SPREAD FROM A NORTHWARD TO A NORTHWESTWARD MOTION DURING THE PERIOD.
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...SHOWING
A SLOW NORTHWARD MOTION BEGINNING IN ABOUT 24 HOURS AND BRINGING
KEITH INTO THE SOUTH-CENTRAL GULF BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THIS IS
ALSO SIMILAR TO THE TRACK SHOWN BY THE EXPERIMENTAL FLORIDA STATE
UNIVERSITY SUPERENSEMBLE MODEL.

ALTHOUGH SATELLITE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE A CONSENSUS 127

TOPS HAVE ERODED AND THE ADVISORY INTENSITY REMAINS 115 KT.  ANOTHER

SMOOTHING OUT THE WOBBLES IN THE TRACK GIVES 275/2 FOR AN INITIAL
MOTION.  KEITH REMAINS IN A WEAK STEERING CURRENT...IN A
MID-TROPOSPHERIC COL BETWEEN A WEAK RIDGE OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF
AND A RIDGE IN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  THE GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT
THE EASTERN RIDGE WILL BUILD WESTWARD AS THE LOW OFFSHORE THE U.S.
SOUTHEAST COAST MOVES OUT.  THIS IS FORECAST TO INCREASE THE
SOUTHERLY FLOW AROUND KEITH AND PRODUCE A NORTH-NORTHWEST
MOTION THAT WOULD MOVE KEITH OVER THE YUCATAN AND EVENTUALLY

LITTLE TO THE WEST OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS NOT IN
GOOD AGREEMENT AND CONFIDENCE IN THE TRACK FORECAST IS NOT HIGH.  OF
CONCERN ARE THE GFDL AND EXPERIMENTAL FSU SUPERENSEMBLE...WHICH
BRING KEITH VERY CLOSE TO THE LOUISIANA COAST IN 72 HOURS. 
HOWEVER...THE SHORT-TERM FORECASTS FROM RECENT GFDL RUNS SUGGEST
THAT THIS MODEL DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE STORM. 
THE AVN...ON WHICH THE GFDL IS BASED HAS THE CENTER OF KEITH
AVOIDING THE YUCATAN ENTIRELY...BUT TIME IS RUNNING OUT ON THIS

KEITH IS WEAKENING DUE TO A COMBINATION OF EFFECTS.  RECON REPORTS
THAT THE PRESSURE HAS RISEN TO 950 MB...AND THE PEAK FLIGHT-LEVEL
WINDS WERE 109 KT.  WITH A PORTION OF THE EYEWALL OVER LAND
TODAY...THE EYE HAS BECOME LESS WELL DEFINED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY
AND THE CONVECTION HAS BECOME ASYMMETRIC.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
SUGGESTS THAT KEITH IS EXPERIENCING SOME UPPER-LEVEL SHEAR FROM THE
DISTURBED WEATHER TO ITS EAST...AND THE OUTFLOW TO THE NORTHWEST IS
BEING RESTRICTED AS WELL.  A RECENT DROPSONDE REPORTED A LOW-LEVEL
LAYER-MEAN WIND OF 119 KT...WHICH SUPPORTS A SURFACE WIND OF ABOUT
100 KT.  WITH A RECENT REPORT FROM AMBERGRIS CAY OF 120 MPH...THE
ADVISORY INTENSITY IS LOWERED ONLY TO 110 KT AT THIS TIME.  KEITH
SHOULD CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AS MORE OF ITS CIRCULATION EDGES ONSHORE. 
GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE CURRENTLY UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT IN
THE GULF COULD CHANGE OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS...AND SOME
REINTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
AFTER A BRIEF WOBBLE TO THE SOUTHWEST EARLIER TODAY...KEITH HAS
RETURNED TO A GENERAL MOTION OF 270/2.  LITTLE MOTION IS EXPECTED
OVER THE NEXT 12 HOURS...BUT THE UKMET AND AVN SUGGEST THAT A MID-
LEVEL RIDGE IN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL BUILD WESTWARD AND INCREASE
THE STEERING FLOW SURROUNDING THE HURRICANE.  THE UKMET BUILDS THIS
RIDGE A LITTLE NORTH OF THE AVN AND AS A RESULT ITS TRACK IS FARTHER
TO THE WEST THAN THE AVN.  THE NEW GFDL IS NOT AS FAST AS ITS
PREDECESSOR AND IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

WITH THE SLOW FORWARD MOTION...DEVASTATING AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL MAY

THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE MOTION DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THE
LATEST TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH FROM SIX HOURS

THE ATLANTIC AS SHOWN IN THE 18Z AVIATION 500 MB FIELDS.  THE GFDL
AND AVIATION MODELS TAKE THE HURRICANE A LITTLE EASTWARD BEFORE
TURNING TOWARD THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST AND THE AVIATION MODEL KEEPS

OTHER MODELS MOVE THE CENTER ACROSS THE YUCATAN PENINSULA AND
INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS QUITE
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...MOVING THE CENTER SLOWLY ACROSS

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT MON OCT 02 2000
 
HURRICANE KEITH HAS DRIFTED SLOWLY SOUTHWARD THE PAST 6 HOURS...BUT
LATEST RECON FIXES INDICATE THAT KEITH MAY HAVE BECOME STATIONARY...
AGAIN.  RECON FOUND FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 85 KT AND A MINIMUM
PRESSURE OF 975 MB...SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS DECREASED TO 85 KT.

INITIAL MOTION IS STATIONARY OR A SLOW DRIFT TO THE NORTH.  THERE IS
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR REASONING. 
THE MODELS HAVE CHANGED LITTLE IN TAKING KEITH SLOWLY NORTH OR
NORTH-NORTHWEST DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  OF COURSE...THE
MODELS HAVE BEEN FORECASTING THAT TREND FOR THE PAST 2 DAYS AND IT
STILL HAS NOT OCCURRED.  THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH REMAINS INTACT AND
THE MID-UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE GULF COAST AND FLORIDA IS
BEGINNING TO WEAKEN AND SHEAR OUT AS SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. 
THAT MEANS THAT KEITH COULD EASILY REMAIN STATIONARY FOR ANOTHER 12
TO 24 HOURS BEFORE MOVING NORTHWARD.

THERE IS NO CHANGE TO PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST.  OBVIOUSLY...THE
INTENSITY FORECAST IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE EXACT TRACK OF
KEITH...IF AND WHEN THE SYSTEM CENTER FINALLY MOVES INLAND OVER THE
YUCATAN PENINSULA.

HURRICANE KEITH DISCUSSION NUMBER  16
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON OCT 02 2000
 
KEITH CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SPIN DOWN.  LAST RECON REPORTED THE
CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS UP TO 979 MB AND THE STRONGEST FLIGHT-LEVEL
WIND WAS 68 KT.  THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT HAM RADIO REPORTS OF 80 MPH
SO THE WINDS WILL BE HELD A LITTLE ABOVE WHAT IS SUGGESTED BY THE
AIRCRAFT.  KEITH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO WEAKEN SLOWLY AS IT
REMAINS PARTIALLY OVER WATER.  OBVIOUSLY THE DECAY WILL BE MUCH
FASTER SHOULD KEITH MOVE INLAND.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS STILL STATIONARY.  THE ANTICIPATED NORTHWARD
DRIFT HAS NOT DEVELOPED YET...AS THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE IN THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC HAS NOT BUILT WEST AS FAR AS ANTICIPATED.  THERE IS AN AREA
OF DISTURBED WEATHER ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW-LEVEL TROUGH IN THE
NORTHERN CARIBBEAN THAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE MINIMAL STEERING
AROUND THE HURRICANE.  THE MORNING INITIALIZATION OF THE AVN PLACES
KEITH ROUGHLY MIDWAY BETWEEN THE ACTUAL POSITION OF THE HURRICANE
AND THE DISTURBED WEATHER TO ITS NORTHEAST.  THE ETA INITIALIZES
BOTH SYSTEMS AND ROTATES THE TWO AROUND EACH OTHER.  THE UKMET...ON
THE OTHER HAND...DOES NOT SHOW THE SECOND SYSTEM AND TAKES KEITH TO
THE NORTHWEST.  GIVEN THIS SPREAD...IT IS HARD TO HAVE MUCH
CONFIDENCE IN THE DETAILS OF THE EVOLUTION OF THESE TWO SYSTEMS...
AND HISTORY SUGGESTS THAT A SLOW MOTION FORECAST IS THE BEST BET. 
ACCORDINGLY...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND MAY WELL NOT BE SLOW ENOUGH.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT MON OCT 02 2000
 
RECON FOUND 76 KT AT 850 MB...WHICH GIVES 60-65 KT AT THE SURFACE
USING STANDARD REDUCTIONS...SO WE WILL KEEP KEITH A HURRICANE FOR AT
LEAST A FEW MORE HOURS.  RECON AND SURFACE REPORTS INDICATE THAT
KEITH IS CREEPING TO THE WEST...BUT IS STILL OVER WATER.  A GRADUAL
WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS MORE OF THE CIRCULATION MOVES OVER LAND.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE TO THE TRACK FORECAST PHILOSOPHY. 
GLOBAL MODELS BUILD A MID-LEVEL RIDGE WESTWARD FROM THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC.  HOWEVER...THIS IS NOT HAPPENING AS FAST AS FORECAST...AND
THE DISTURBANCE OVER WESTERN CUBA...WHICH IS NOT WELL INITIALIZED IN
EITHER THE AVN OR UKMET...IS PROBABLY INTERFERING WITH THE RIDGING
PROCESS.  THE AVN ALSO HAS BEEN INITIALIZING KEITH IN THE WRONG
PLACE FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS OR SO.  THEREFORE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS NOT AS FAST TO THE NORTHWEST AS MUCH OF THE GUIDANCE...INCLUDING
THE UKMET WHICH TAKES KEITH TO THE TEXAS COAST IN 72 HOURS.

ASSUMING KEITH EVER MOVES INLAND...IT WILL LIKELY SPEND AT LEAST 24
HOURS OVER LAND.  GIVE THE SMALL WIND ENVELOPE...IT IS NOT CLEAR
THAT MUCH WILL SURVIVE THE TRIP.  HOWEVER...THE GLOBAL MODELS
FORECAST A VERY FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT IN THE GULF IN 48-
72 HOURS...AND SO WE LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF A SUBSTANTIAL
RECOVERY LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON OCT 02 2000
 
THE LAST RECON FLIGHT FOUND 75 KT WINDS AT 850 MB AT 2036Z...AND
DECREASING WINDS THEREAFTER.  THE LAST REPORTED PRESSURE WAS 988 MB. 
DEEP CONVECTION IS NOW LIMITED TO THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  KEITH IS
DOWNGRADED TO A 60 KT TROPICAL STORM...AND THIS MAY BE A LITTLE
GENEROUS.

THE RECON FIXES INDICATED THAT KEITH WAS DRIFTING AT 330/2.  IT IS
UNCERTAIN WHETHER THIS IS ANOTHER OF THE CYCLONE'S MEANDERS...OR IF
IT IS THE START OF THE LONG-AWAITED NORTHWEST TURN.  IF IT IS THE
LATTER...IT LOOKS RATHER STRANGE GIVEN THAT WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES A RIDGE OVER THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND THAT A
TROPICAL DISTURBANCE IS TRYING TO DEVELOP JUST NORTH OF WESTERN
CUBA.  IN THEORY...THIS COMBINATION SHOULD KEEP KEITH ON A MORE
WESTWARD TRACK.  DESPITE THE THEORY...ALL MODEL GUIDANCE AGREES WITH
A GRADUAL ACCELERATION TO THE NORTHWEST AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS EAST
OF THE STORM.  SEVERAL OF THE MODELS EVEN CALL FOR LANDFALL ON THE
NORTHWESTERN GULF COAST BEFORE 72 HR.  GIVEN KEITH'S RELUCTANCE TO
MOVE NORTH...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL NOT GO AS FAST AS THE
GUIDANCE AND WILL BE AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  IT WOULD
NOT BE THE LEAST SURPRISING IF KEITH DID NOT TURN NORTHWARD AT
ALL...A TRACK FAVORED BY THE HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL PREDICTION CENTER.
 
WHILE KEITH IS SUFFERING FROM A COMBINATION OF EASTERLY SHEAR AND
LAND INTERACTION...IT SHOWS A GOOD CYCLONIC ENVELOPE AND BANDED
CONVECTION HAS BEEN OCCURRING AWAY FROM THE CENTER OVER THE NORTHERN
AND WESTERN YUCATAN PENINSULA.  ASSUMING IT FOLLOWS THE FORECAST
TRACK...THE STORM SHOULD WEAKEN WHILE OVER LAND.  THE CURRENT
STRUCTURE AND PREDICTED FAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL WINDS OVER THE GULF OF
MEXICO SHOULD ALLOW FOR RE-INTENSIFICATION...IF THE CENTER GETS
THERE.

THE CENTER OF KEITH HAS FINALLY MOVED INLAND.  THE LAST RECON REPORT
HAD THE CENTER SOUTHWEST OF CHETUMAL MEXICO ON RADAR AND A MINIMUM
PRESSURE OF 990 MB.  TERRAIN HAZARDS KEPT THE CREW FROM LOCATING THE
STRONGEST WINDS...BUT SATELLITE IMAGERY AND THE RECON WIND DATA
SUGGEST THE MAXIMUM WINDS HAVE DECREASED CONSIDERABLY.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/05.  NOW THAT KEITH IS INLAND...
RAPID WEAKENING SHOULD OCCUR.  THIS MAY PLAY A ROLE IN THE FUTURE
TRACK OF KEITH.  I HAVE FOLLOWED THE MEDIUM BAM AND GFDL MODELS
THROUGH 36 HOURS...AND THEN TAKE KEITH MORE NORTHWARD AFTERWARDS
SIMILAR TO THE UKMET MODEL.  THE UKMET SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE FAST
WITH THE FORWARD MOTION...WHILE THE AVN MODEL LOSES KEITH AFTER
ABOUT 24 HOURS.  ONCE KEITH EMERGES OVER THE SOUTHERN GULF OF
MEXICO...RE-INTENSIFICATION AND A DEEPER CIRCULATION SHOULD DEVELOP. 
THE DEEP LAYER FLOW AFTER 48 HOURS FAVORS A MORE NORTHWARD THAN
WESTWARD MOTION...AND THAT TREND WAS FOLLOWED AS PER THE NOGAPS AND
UKMET MODELS.
 
KEITH HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING NORTHEAST TO EASTERLY SHEAR THE PAST 36
HOURS.  THAT SHEAR PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE UNTIL KEITH
EMERGES OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO.  AT THAT TIME...ALL THE GLOBAL
AGREE THAT THE CENTER OF KEITH SHOULD BE UNDER THE MEAN 200 MB RIDGE
AXIS AND IN A LOW OR NO SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  WITH BOTH A POLEWARD AND
EQUATORWARD OUTFLOW PATTERN PRESENT...RE-INTENSIFICATION IS
EXPECTED.  HOWEVER...SUCH A PATTERN OFTENTIMES RESULTS IN RAPID
INTENSIFICATION...BUT THE INTENSIFICATION RATE WAS HELD DOWN DUE THE
POSSIBILITY OF THE DRY MID-LEVEL AIR CURRENTLY OVER THE CENTRAL
WESTERN GULF NOT MOVING OUT IN TIME.

TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS AND KEITH IS DOWNGRADED TO A DEPRESSION. 
THE MID-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS MOVING SMARTLY TO THE WEST OVER

DATA FROM THE GULFSTREAM JET MISSION IN THE GULF LAST NIGHT SHOWED A
MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO.  THESE
DATA WERE WELL-ANALYZED BY THE AVN BUT SEEMINGLY NOT SO BY THE

KEITH IS CONTINUING ITS TREK ACROSS THE YUCATAN THIS AFTERNOON.  THE
MID-LEVEL CIRCULATION HAS BEEN SHEARED OFF TO THE WEST OF THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER...REVEALING A WELL-ORGANIZED LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  THE
EXPOSED CENTER ALLOWS US TO BE MORE CONFIDENT WITH THE CURRENT
MOTION ESTIMATE...WHICH IS 290/6.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS NOW COMING
INTO BETTER AGREEMENT IN REJECTING A NORTHWARD TURN TOWARD EASTERN
TEXAS OR LOUISIANA.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO REMAIN IN THE
NORTHERN GULF AND KEEP KEITH ON A WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK FOR THE
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  AFTER THAT A SLIGHT TURN TO THE NORTHWEST IS
POSSIBLE WITH THE APPROACH OF THE NEXT MAJOR MID-LATITUDE TROUGH. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AGAIN SHIFTED WELL TO THE LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY...BUT UNLIKE EARLIER...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
NOW IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE GUIDANCE.

KEITH WILL BE EMERGING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO IN ANOTHER 12 TO 18
HOURS OR SO WITH ITS LOW-LEVEL STRUCTURE RELATIVELY INTACT.  ARGUING
AGAINST SIGNIFICANT RESTRENGTHENING IS THE EASTERLY SHEAR CURRENTLY
OVER THE CYCLONE.  THIS SHOULD BE SLOWLY DIMINISHING BUT PERHAPS NOT
FAST ENOUGH TO ALLOW KEITH TO EXPLOSIVELY DEEPEN IN THE SOUTHERN

AN IMPRESSIVE CONVECTIVE BURST HAS OCCURRED OVER THE BAY OF CAMPECHE
AND THE ADJACENT COAST THIS EVENING WELL WEST AND SOUTHWEST OF THE
CENTER OF KEITH.  WHILE SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM CARMEN AND
CAMPECHE DO NOT YET INDICATE KEITH IS STRENGTHENING... THIS MAY BE A
HARBINGER OF THINGS TO COME ONCE THE CENTER REACHES THE GULF OF
MEXICO.  THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY REMAINS AT 25 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.

LAST-LIGHT VISIBLE IMAGERY SUGGESTED THE CENTER WAS MOVING SLIGHTLY
TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW
295/7.  THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO EITHER THE SYNOPTIC REASONING OR
FORECAST TRACK FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGES.  A BUILDING DEEP LAYER
RIDGE TO THE EAST OF THE CYCLONE SHOULD PUSH IT ON A GENERALLY WEST-
NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST TRACK.  THE ONE TRICKY PART OF THE FORECAST
IS IF SOME KIND OF NORTHWARD TURN MIGHT OCCUR BEFORE THE CENTER
REACHES THE NORTHEAST COAST OF MEXICO IN 48-72 HR IN RESPONSE TO AN
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT OVER THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS.  WHILE SOME TRACK GUIDANCE DOES INDICATE THIS...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST WILL WAIT TO INDICATE SUCH A TURN IN CASE KEITH SHOULD PULL
SOME TRACK-ALTERING TRICKS AS IT MOVES OFF THE COAST.

ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL SOME EASTERLY SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE...
CONDITIONS GENERALLY APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR RE-INTENSIFICATION ONCE
THE CENTER MOVES OVER THE WATER.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR
STEADY STRENGTHENING UNTIL THE CYCLONE MAKES LANDFALL IN 72 HR.  IT
IS POSSIBLE THAT KEITH WILL STRENGTHEN FASTER THAN CURRENTLY

WITH A FEW IR IMAGES ONLY AND NO RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT...THE
CURRENT ANALYSIS AND FORECAST MAY BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BUT INDEED...
KEITH LOOKS LIKE A STRONG TROPICAL STORM ON IR IMAGES OR READY TO BE
ONE.  IN FACT...LATEST DVORAK T-NUMBER FROM TAFB SUGGEST WINDS UP TO
55 KNOTS.  I AM REALLY TEMPTED TO BRING KEITH BACK TO TROPICAL STORM
STATUS AT THIS TIME BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GROUND OBSERVATIONS
NEAR THE POSSIBLE CENTER TO SUPPORT TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH...AND
BECAUSE THE CENTER MAY BE ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF THE CONVECTION AS
SUGGESTED BY CONTINUITY...KEITH IS KEPT AS A 30-KNOT DEPRESSION AT
THIS TIME.  EARLIER OBSERVATIONS FROM OIL PLATFORMS FROM PEMEX
REPORTED WINDS FROM THE NORTHWEST OF 34 KNOTS AND 1001 MB PRESSURE
JUST TO THE WEST OF KEITH.  HOWEVER...I DO NOT KNOW HOW HIGH THESE
PLATFORMS ARE.   IF THE PRESENT TREND CONTINUES...KEITH COULD BECOME
A HURRICANE BEFORE LANDFALL BETWEEN 48 AND 72 HOURS. 

IT APPEARS THAT THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS MOVING TOWARD THE WEST-
NORTHWEST A LITTLE BIT FASTER...ABOUT 9 KNOTS.  THERE IS A RIDGE OF
HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF KEITH AND MOST OF THE GLOBAL
MODELS ERODE THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE RIDGE IN TIME.  THIS WOULD
ALLOW KEITH TO MOVE ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH
72 HOURS.  THE NORTHERNMOST TRACK...TOWARD SOUTHERN TEXAS IS
PROVIDED BY NOGAPS...WHICH WAS THE ONLY MODEL NEVER TO MOVE KEITH
NORTHWARD.  WATCHES OR WARNING FOR A PORTION OF THE COAST OF MEXICO
MAY BE REQUIRED TODAY.

VISIBLE IMAGES AND A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE WILL HELP TO DETERMINE

EARLY MORNING VISIBLE IMAGES HAVE NOT ENTIRELY CLARIFIED THE

LOW CLOUDS SUGGEST THAT THE SURFACE CIRCULATION IS ELONGATED TO THE

TO A TROPICAL STORM UNTIL RECON GETS OUT THERE AROUND 18Z.
REGARDLESS...THE SYSTEM IS CLEARLY IMPROVING IN ORGANIZATION AND
SHOULD REGAIN THAT STATUS SOON.  I AM CLOSE TO THE SHIPS INTENSITY

DATA FROM THE GULFSTREAM JET LAST NIGHT OVER THE GULF SHOW ENOUGH OF
A RIDGE IN THE WESTERN GULF TO KEEP KEITH ON A WEST TO WEST-

THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY OR
TRACK.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE SHOULD KEEP KEITH ON A GENERALLY WEST-
NORTHWESTERLY TRACK FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  AFTER THAT A GRADUAL
TURN TO THE NORTHWEST COULD OCCUR WITH THE APPROACH OF THE NEXT MID-
LATITUDE TROUGH.

KEITH HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE EVENING...WITH
PERSISTENT CONVECTION WITH TOPS OF -80C OR COLDER NEAR THE CENTER. 
THE LAST RECON FLIGHT FOUND THE PRESSURE HAD DROPPED TO 988 MB. 
THERE WAS A FLIGHT LEVEL WIND TO 80 KT...BUT THIS LOOKED LIKE SOME
SORT OF TRANSIENT FEATURE.  THERE WAS ALSO NO INDICATION AT THAT
TIME OF AN EYE OR EYEWALL FORMING.  THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE SET TO 60
KT...AND THERE IS EVERY EXPECTATION THAT KEITH WILL BE A HURRICANE
BY THE TIME THE NEXT AIRCRAFT ARRIVES AT 06Z.

KEITH IS MOVING 290/11 ON THE WEST SIDE OF A DEEP LAYER RIDGE OVER
THE GULF OF MEXICO.  THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL
LANDFALL ON THE MEXICAN COAST IN 12-24 HR.  A GRADUAL TURN TO THE
NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST IS POSSIBLE AFTER LANDFALL DUE TO A
DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE UNITED STATES.

KEITH IS IN A LIGHT SHEAR ENVIRONMENT WITH GOOD OUTFLOW OVER THE
SOUTH SEMICIRCLE AND FAIR TO POOR ELSEWHERE.  THIS...COMBINED WITH
THE COLD CLOUD TOPS AND WARM WATER...INDICATES THAT STRENGTHENING IS
LIKELY UP TO LANDFALL.  MAXIMUM WINDS COULD REACH 75-80 KT BEFORE
LANDFALL.  WEAKENING WILL OCCUR AFTER LANDFALL...AND KEITH SHOULD
DISSIPATE OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF NORTHEASTERN MEXICO BY 72 HR.
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS HAVE BEEN CHANGED AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE
MEXICAN WEATHER SERVICE AND THE BROWNSVILLE TEXAS WFO.

DATA FROM AN AIR FORCE PLANE INDICATE THAT KEITH HAS REACHED
HURRICANE STRENGTH.  THIS IS BASED ON FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 77 KNOTS
AT 700 MB...A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 987 MB AND A CIRCULAR EYE OF 20
NAUTICAL MILES IN DIAMETER.  IN ADDITION...BOTH TAFB AND AIR FORCE
GLOBAL DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS SUPPORT HURRICANE STRENGTH.  KEITH HAS
AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW...WITH A DISTINCT OUTFLOW JET TO THE SOUTHWEST.
LAND IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE FACTOR FOR FURTHER STRENGTHENING AND KEITH
COULD BE A LITTLE STRONGER BEFORE LANDFALL IN ABOUT 12 HOURS.

KEITH IS NOW MOVING 295/12.  UPPER-AIR DATA FROM MEXICO AND THE
UNITED STATES SHOW A STRONG MID-LEVEL RIDGE ANCHORED TO THE NORTH OF
KEITH.  THIS TYPE OF WARM HIGH IS IN GENERAL VERY PERSISTENT AND
SHOULD KEEP THE HURRICANE ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK UNTIL
LANDFALL ALONG THE MEXICAN COAST WITHIN THE WARNING AREA LATER TODAY

RECON SEVERAL HOURS AGO FOUND 700 MB WINDS OF 85 KT...WHICH SUPPORTS
A 75 KT SURFACE WIND ESTIMATE.  I HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE DEEPENING
WAS NOT QUITE FINISHED IN GOING WITH 80 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY. 
LITTLE ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY AS THE CENTER IS ONLY A
FEW HOURS FROM THE COAST.

THE CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 315/10...A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT AND
SLOWER THAN EARLIER.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF

RADAR DATA FROM TAMPICO AND BROWNSVILLE SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER OF
KEITH TURNED SOMEWHAT TO THE LEFT AFTER LANDFALL.  THIS DOES NOT
AGREE WELL WITH THE SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM CIUDAD VICTORIA....
WHICH HAS REPORTED PERSISTENT NORTHERLY WINDS.  HOWEVER...
SIMULTANEOUS WITH THOSE WINDS WAS A REPORT OF THUNDERSTORMS MOVING
NORTHWEST.  THIS SUGGESTS THE WIND DIRECTION MAY BE AFFECTED BY
TERRAIN.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS SET TO 300/11 BASED ON THE RADAR.

THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE TO SAY.  KEITH IS MOVING INTO THE MOUNTAINS OF
NORTHEASTERN MEXICO AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO WEAKEN.  IT WILL LIKELY

THE DISTURBANCE THAT MOVED ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA OVER THE
PAST 24 HOURS HAS GRADUALLY BEEN DEVELOPING A CIRCULATION...WHEREAS
EARLIER THE SYSTEM HAD MULTIPLE SMALL TRANSIENT SWIRLS ALONG A
FRONTAL ZONE.  WITH CONVECTION AND STRONG WINDS WELL TO THE EAST OF
THE CENTER...THIS SYSTEM NOW HAS THE STRUCTURE OF A SUBTROPICAL
CYCLONE.  WE RECEIVED A SATELLITE CLASSIFICATION OF SUBTROPICAL T1.5
FROM TAFB.  UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT FOR THIS SYSTEM IS BEING PROVIDED BY
A TROUGH...RATHER THAN AN ANTICYCLONE TYPICALLY FOUND ABOVE TROPICAL
SYSTEMS.  AMONG OTHER THINGS...SUBTROPICAL CYCLONES DIFFER FROM
TROPICAL CYCLONES IN THAT THE FORMER ARE LESS SYMMETRICAL AND HAVE
THEIR STRONGEST WINDS AND PRESSURE GRADIENT WELL REMOVED FROM THE
CIRCULATION CENTER.

THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET TO 30 KT BASED ON THE SATELLITE
CLASSIFICATION AND SHIP REPORTS.  THE CYCLONE WILL BE MOVING OVER
WARM WATER AND THESE SYSTEMS OCCASIONALLY TRANSFORM INTO TROPICAL
CYCLONES.  REGARDLESS OF THE TECHNICAL STATUS OF THE SYSTEM...
INTENSIFICATION IS EXPECTED.
 
THE BAROCLINIC GLOBAL MODELS CAN BE EXPECTED TO HANDLE THIS KIND OF
SYSTEM FAIRLY WELL AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE AVN...BUT
IS A LITTLE FASTER AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE CYCLONE
IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY CURVE AWAY FROM THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST AS
IT BECOMES EMBEDDED IN THE WESTERLIES.

A NOAA HURRICANE HUNTER FOUND A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 1010 MB
AND A LARGE AREA OF 30-35 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OVER THE SOUTHEAST
QUADRANT.  THE LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A STRONG CONVECTIVE
FLARE-UP EAST OF THE CENTER...BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE PROPAGATING AWAY
FROM THE CENTER INTO THE STRONGER LOW-LEVEL SOUTHWEST FLOW. 
THEREFORE IT MAY NOT BE HELPING THE SYSTEM STRENGTHEN.  THE MAXIMUM
WINDS REMAIN 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE NEXT AIRCRAFT IS
SCHEDULED TO BE IN THE SYSTEM ABOUT 06Z.

THE DEPRESSION HAS TURNED MORE EASTWARD DURING THE EVENING.  THE
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MOTION IS 060/8...AND THIS MAY BE A BIT
GENEROUS WITH THE NORTHWARD COMPONENT.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES THE CYCLONE IS IN A LARGE AREA OF GENERAL WESTERLY TO
WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW...WITH SHOULD CONTINUE A GENERAL EAST TO
EAST-NORTHEAST MOTION.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS AND NHC TRACK GUIDANCE
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS THIS...AND IS SHIFTED CONSIDERABLY TO THE SOUTH BASED ON THE
CURRENT POSITION AND MOTION.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A MID/UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH
OVER OR JUST NORTHWEST OF THE CYCLONE...WHICH MAY BE PROVIDING UPPER
LEVEL DIFFLUENCE AND PARTLY SHELTERING THE SYSTEM FROM WESTERLY
SHEAR.  BETWEEN THIS AND THE CURRENT STRONG CONVECTION THERE IS THE
POSSIBILITY OF SOME STRENGTHENING.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THAT
THE SHEAR COULD DECREASE OVER THE NEXT 36 HOURS...ESPECIALLY IF THE
CYCLONE TAKES A MORE EASTERLY TRACK.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL
CONTINUE TO CALL FOR SOME STRENGTHENING...WITH A LEVELING OFF OF THE
INTENSITY AFTER 36 HR WHEN THE CYCLONE MOVES INTO STRONGER UPPER
LEVEL WINDS.

DATA FROM AN AIR FORCE PLANE INDICATE THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE PRESSURE OR WIND FIELDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE SUBTROPICAL DEPRESSION.  HOWEVER...SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE
THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER MAY BE CLOSER TO THE CONVECTION. THIS

INTENSITY CHANGE IN PURE TROPICAL SYSTEMS...WELL...IT IS EVEN MORE
DIFFICULT TO DO SO FOR A SUBTROPICAL SYSTEM.  ALL THAT CAN BE SAID
AT THIS TIME IS THAT IF THE CONVECTION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEAR THE
CENTER...AND THE WIND FIELD BECOMES MORE SYMMETRIC...THE SYSTEM
WOULD BECOME A TROPICAL STORM.   

THE SUBTROPICAL DEPRESSION IS MOVING TOWARD THE EAST OR 080 DEGREES
AT 8 KNOTS AND IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE EASTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF A SHORT
WAVE TROUGH.  THEREFORE...THIS MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE TODAY WITH A
GRADUAL TURN TO THE EAST-NORTHEAST AS IT APPROACHES THE PERIPHERY OF

RECONNAISSANCE OBSERVATIONS THIS MORNING SHOW THAT THE WIND FIELD OF
THE SUBTROPICAL DEPRESSION HAS BEEN CONTRACTING...WITH PEAK FLIGHT-
LEVEL WINDS OF 44 KT REPORTED WITHIN 75 NM OF THE CENTER...WHEREAS
YESTERDAY THEY WERE ABOUT TWICE AS FAR OUT...AND THERE HAS ALSO BEEN
MORE CONSISTENT CONVECTION IN THE VICINITY OF THE CIRCULATION. 
WHILE THIS IS BY NO MEANS A CLASSIC TROPICAL CYCLONE...IT HAS ENOUGH
TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS...AND WIND...TO BE CONSIDERED A TROPICAL
STORM.  IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING THAT NATURE PRODUCES A WHOLE
SPECTRUM OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CYCLONES...AND THAT THEY DO NOT
ALWAYS NEATLY FIT INTO THE SMALL NUMBER OF CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WE
HAVE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN OUR ADVISORIES.

THE CENTER IS STILL NOT TIGHT...BUT THE INITIAL MOTION IS BEST
ESTIMATED AS 080/13...FASTER THAN BEFORE.  LESLIE IS EMBEDDED WITHIN
THE EASTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF A SHORT WAVE TROUGH.  THEREFORE...THIS
MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE TODAY WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS MODELLED AFTER THE GLOBAL MODELS BUT IS
FASTER THAN THE AVN WHICH DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON

LESLIE HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN STRUCTURE OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...
WITH A MOSTLY EXPOSED LOW-LEVEL CENTER AND DISORGANIZED CONVECTION
OVER THE EAST QUADRANT.  THE NOAA HURRICANE HUNTER FOUND A CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 1009-1010 MB AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 37 KT...
WHICH WOULD NOT REALLY SUPPORT KEEPING LESLIE A STORM.  HOWEVER...
SHIP 8PNK REPORTED 36 KT WINDS IN ONE OF THE CONVECTIVE CLUSTERS AT
00Z.  THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE THUS KEPT AT 35 KT.  AN AIR FORCE
RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER WILL INVESTIGATE THE STORM AROUND 06Z.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 085/11.  LESLIE IS EMBEDDED IN A GENERAL WEST
TO WEST-SOUTHWEST MID/UPPER LEVEL FLOW...WHICH IS PUSHING THE STORM
INTO THE BERMUDA-AZORES HIGH AT LOW LEVELS.  THE OVERALL STEERING
FLOW SHOULD INCREASE AND BECOME SOUTHWESTERLY AS A LARGE DEEP-LAYER
TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.  THIS SHOULD
ACCELERATE LESLIE TO THE NORTHEAST.  ALL TRACK GUIDANCE AGREES ON
THIS...WITH THE ONLY DIFFERENCES BEING IN HOW FAST LESLIE WILL MOVE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL LEAN TOWARD THE FASTER GFDL...GFDN...
AVN...AND UKMET...ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THOSE
MODELS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT TRICKY.  WESTERLY SHEAR APPEARS
TO BE INCREASING...AND UPPER LEVEL WINDS FORECAST BY THE LARGE SCALE
MODELS DO NOT APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING. INDEED...MOST
INTENSITY GUIDANCE FORECAST EITHER WEAKENING OR NO CHANGE IN
STRENGTH.  ON THE OTHER HAND...LESLIE HAS A LARGE ENVELOPE...AND
ACCELERATION WOULD INCREASE THE WINDS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE
CIRCULATION.  THERE COULD ALSO BE A DECREASE IN STORM-RELATIVE
SHEAR...WHICH COULD LEAD TO SOME STRENGTHENING SIMILAR TO THAT OF
FLORENCE A FEW WEEKS AGO.  BAROCLINICALLY-INDUCED STRENGTHENING IS
ALSO POSSIBLE BEFORE EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION. THE INTENSITY
FORECAST WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR SOME GRADUAL STRENGTHENING...BUT
NOT TO THE LEVEL OF THE GFDN WHICH HAS LESLIE AT 70 KT IN 36 HR. 
HOWEVER...IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT LESLIE COULD WEAKEN TO A
DEPRESSION BEFORE PASSING BERMUDA.

5 AM EDT FRI OCT 06 2000
 
LESLIE HAS A LARGE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION WITH MOST OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE WELL EXPOSED CENTER.  MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED BY AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE IS
DOWN TO 1006 MB BUT THE WINDS REMAIN ABOUT 35 KNOTS.  LESLIE COULD
STRENGTHEN SOME BEFORE BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL IN ABOUT 48 HOURS.

LESLIE IS CURRENTLY MOVING TOWARD THE EAST OR 080 DEGREES AT 13
KNOTS.   HOWEVER...IT IS FORECAST TO TURN MORE TO THE NORTHEAST
AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND AHEAD OF A TROUGH
WITH AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF
THE GUIDANCE.

WITH THE CLOSEST APPROACH TO BERMUDA IN ABOUT 24 HOURS AND BECAUSE
MOST OF THE WEATHER IS LOCATED TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER...A
TROPICAL STORM WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THE ISLAND.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 075/09.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE
ACCELERATES THE SYSTEM NORTHEASTWARD...ACROSS OR NEAR NEWFOUNDLAND
AFTER 48 HOURS AS AN AMPLIFYING TROUGH MOVES ACROSS EASTERN NORTH
AMERICA.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED TO THE LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
A RECON PLANE RECENTLY FOUND 45 KNOT WINDS ABOUT 90 NMI EAST-
SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER AT 850 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGEERY SHOWS THE LOW
LEVEL CENTER COMPLETELY EXPOSED WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION WELL
SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  THE INTENSITY IS HELD AT 35 KNOTS ALTHOUGH
99 PERCENT OF THE SURFACE WINDS ARE LIKELY BELOW THAT VALUE.  THIS
STORM IS FORECAST TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL AS IT IS SWEPT ALONG BY
THE AMPLIFYING TROUGH AND COULD STRENGTHEN A LITTLE AS THIS OCCURS.
 
A TROPICAL STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR BERMUDA.  THIS IS
PRIMARILY FOR MARINE INTERESTS.

THE LOW LEVEL CENTER REMAINS TOTALLY EXPOSED WITH THE DEEP
CONVECTIVE TOPS GRADUALLY WARMING WELL TO THE SOUTHEAST.  A RECENT
RECON AIRCRAFT FOUND 1007 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE AND A MAXIMUM WIND OF
41 KNOTS AT 1500 FT LOCATED 80 NMI SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  LESLIE
IS DOWNGRADED TO A 30 KNOT DEPRESSION.  SINCE THERE IS SO LITTLE
CONVECTION...ANY STRENGTHENING SHOULD BE FROM BAROCLINIC SOURCES AND
THE FORECAST ALLOWS FOR THIS BY INCREASING THE WINDS TO 45 KNOTS AT
36 HOURS.  EVEN THIS MAY BE UNLIKEY AS THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL DOES
NOT SHOW ANY SUCH STRENGTHENING.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 060/09.  THE GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO
ACCELERATE THE SYSTEM NORTHEASTWARD...TO NEAR NEWFOUNDLAND IN ABOUT
48 HOURS...IMPLYING A FORWARD MOTION INCREASING TO 40 KNOTS OR MORE.
THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL IN A DAY OR SO AND TO

THE CENTER OF LESLIE REMAINS FULLY EXPOSED...ALTHOUGH A FEW SMALL
CONVECTIVE CELLS HAVE DEVELOPED WELL EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE
CENTER IN THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS.  THE LAST RECON FLIGHT AT
06/2303Z REPORTED A PRESSURE DROP TO 1006 MB AND 1500 FT. WINDS OF
46 KT...AWAY FROM ANY CONVECTION.  THOSE VALUES INDICATE THAT LESLIE
IS JUST BELOW TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH...SO 30 KT IS MAINTAINED AS
THE INITIAL INTENSITY DUE TO THE LACK OF ANY DEEP CONVECTION AROUND
OR NEAR THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER...BUT THE GUST FACTOR WAS INCREASED IN
THE FORECAST/MARINE ADVISORY.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 050/14.  LESLIE HAS SHIFTED TO THE
LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...SIMILAR TO THE 18Z GFDL MODEL RUN.
LESLIE SHOULD CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE TO THE NORTHEAST AHEAD OF AN
APPROACHING STRONG COLD FRONT AND UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEFORE BEING
ABSORBED BY THE FRONT IN 24 TO 36 HOURS...AFTER WHICH THE SYSTEM
SHOULD BECOME AN EXTRATROPICAL LOW.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS TO THE
LEFT OF AND FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND CLOSE TO THE GFDL
MODEL.  THIS SCENARIO IS BETWEEN THE 12Z UKMET AND THE 00Z SHALLOW
BAM MODEL RUNS.
 
BASED ON THE LAST RECON REPORT...IT WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH CONVECTION
TO DEVELOP NEAR THE SYSTEM CENTER TO BRING THE STRONGER WINDS DOWN
TO THE SURFACE AND MAKE LESLIE A TROPICAL STORM AGAIN.  THAT
POSSIBILITY EXISTS TONIGHT DURING THE DIURNAL CONVECTIVE MAXIMUM
PERIOD.  HOWEVER...BY 24 TO 36 HOURS...LESLIE IS EXPECTED TO MERGE
WITH THE COLD FRONT AND STRENGTHEN INTO A STRONG MID-LATITUDE
EXTRATROPICAL SYSTEM.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 18Z AVN AND 12Z
UKMET MODEL RUNS WHICH SHOW STEADY DEEPENING AFTER 36 HOURS

11 PM EDT MON OCT 16 2000
 
THE LOW PRESSURE CENTER BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS HAS
GRADUALLY BEEN ACQUIRING TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS OVER THE PAST 24
HOURS.  AN AMSU PASS THIS MORNING...COURTESY OF THE UW/CIMSS WEB
PAGE...SHOWED THE BEGINNINGS OF A WARM CORE ALOFT.  RECENT INFRARED
IMAGERY SHOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW TO THE WEST
AND NORTH OF THE CENTER...AND THE CIRCULATION APPEARS TO HAVE
CONTRACTED AS WELL.  WHILE THE CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER IS NOT
DEEP...IT IS WELL ORGANIZED...AND THE LOW CLEARLY NOW MEETS THE
CRITERIA FOR A TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THE SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATE
FROM TAFB USING THE TROPICAL CLASSIFICATION IS 30 KT...AND IS THE
BASIS FOR THE ADVISORY INTENSITY VALUE.  A QUIKSCAT PASS NEAR 23Z
HAD ONE RAIN-FREE VECTOR OF 35 KT...SO THE DEPRESSION IS PROBABLY
VERY CLOSE TO TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN THE DEPRESSION TOMORROW AFTERNOON TO PROVIDE
SOME DIRECT INTENSITY DATA.
 
THERE HAS BEEN A SLOW EAST OR NORTHEASTWARD DRIFT DURING THE DAY
TODAY.  THE DEPRESSION IS IN A WEAK STEERING FLOW...CURRENTLY CUTOFF
FROM THE WESTERLIES TO THE NORTH...AND IN BETWEEN TWO MID-LEVEL
RIDGES TO THE EAST AND WEST OF THE CYCLONE.  GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE
THAT THE RIDGE TO THE WEST WILL GRADUALLY ERODE OVER THE NEXT DAY OR
TWO AS A SHORT-WAVE TROUGH AMPLIFIES AND MOVES OFF THE NORTHEAST
U.S. COAST IN ABOUT 48 HOURS.  THIS SCENARIO CALLS FOR LITTLE MOTION
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO FOLLOWED BY AN ACCELERATION TO THE NORTH
THEN NORTHEAST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BETWEEN THE GFDL AND THE
MEDIUM LAYER BAM.
 
ALTHOUGH OUTFLOW HAS BEEN IMPROVING...THE DEPRESSION IS EMBEDDED
WITHIN AN UPPER LEVEL LOW THAT DOES NOT SEEM CONDUCIVE TO RAPID
STRENGTHENING.  WITHIN 36 TO 48 HOURS THE SHEAR AHEAD OF THE
APPROACHING TROUGH WOULD ALSO NOT BE EXPECTED TO BE FAVORABLE.  ONLY
MODEST STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED BY THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH IS
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION THIRTEEN HAS STRENGTHENED INTO TROPICAL STORM
MICHAEL BASED ON A CONSENSUS SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 35 KT
...DVORAK T2.5...FROM ALL THREE SATELLITE CLASSIFICATION AGENCIES.
MODERATE CONVECTION...CLOUD TOPS OF -50C TO -60C...HAVE NOW
COMPLETELY ENCIRCLED THE NEARLY CLOUD-FREE CENTRAL CORE. OUTFLOW IS
GOOD IN ALL QUADRANTS...EXCEPT RESTRICTED TO THE SOUTHWEST.
 
MICHAEL HAS REMAINED NEARLY STATIONARY DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS...
WHILE MAKING A TIGHT CYCLONIC LOOP DUE TO THE CONVECTION ROTATING
AROUND THE CENTER.  MICHAEL IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN EMBEDDED IN A WEAK
STEERING FLOW REGIME IN THE NECK OF A CUTOFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW. THERE
MAY BE A SLIGHT DRIFT TO THE EAST OR NORTHEAST AS THE LONGWAVE
TROUGH-RIDGE PATTERN SHIFTS SLOWLY EASTWARD AS THE NORTHERN U.S.
TROUGH MOVES TOWARD THE U.S. EAST COAST.  HOWEVER...THE OVERALL
TREND SHOULD BE FOR VERY LITTLE MOTION DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36
HOURS...WITH GRADUAL ACCELERATION TO THE NORTHEAST AFTERWARDS AS
MICHAEL GETS PICKED UP BY THE NORTHERN U.S. SHORTWAVE TROUGH.  THIS
SCENARIO IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS...AND IS CLOSE
TO THE GFDL AND MEDIUM BAM MODELS...AND THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK.

THE OUTFLOW PATTERN REMAINS QUITE IMPRESSIVE TO THE NORTH FOR A
PREVIOUSLY COLD-CORE SYSTEM.  ALTHOUGH NOT AN EYE FEATURE...THE
NEARLY CLOUD-FREE INNER CORE HAS DEVELOPED MODERATE CONVECTION ALL
THE WAY AROUND.  IF THIS SYSTEM WAS IN THE DEEP TROPICS...SUCH A
PATTERN WOULD BE INDICATIVE OF A HURRICANE.  HOWEVER...ONLY SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED DUE TO THE RATHER SHALLOW NATURE OF THE
SURROUNDING CONVECTION AND INCREASING WESTERLY SHEAR AS THE U.S.
SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SHIPS
INTENSITY MODEL AND THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. AN AIR FORCE RESERVE
HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT WILL INVESTIGATE MICHAEL LATER TODAY WHICH
SHOULD PROVE TO BE QUITE INTERESTING.

DEVELOPING OVER THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES...WITH RIDGING EAST
OF MICHAEL.  INFRARED IMAGERY AND SURFACE ANALYSES INDICATE A STRONG
LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE NORTH AND EAST OF THE HURRICANE.  THE TROUGH AND
THE ASSOCIATED SOUTHWESTERLIES SHOULD MOVE MICHAEL NORTHEASTWARD...
HOWEVER THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE IS CURRENTLY PREVENTING SIGNIFICANT
EASTWARD MOTION.  THE RIDGE WILL WEAKEN AS A SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS
NEAR NEW ENGLAND OR THE CANADIAN MARITIMES...AND MICHAEL SHOULD TURN
NORTHEASTWARD AND ACCELERATE AS THAT HAPPENS.  ALL MODEL GUIDANCE
AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO...WITH THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BEING IN HOW
FAST MICHAEL WILL MOVE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS TO THE LEFT AND
SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...ACCELERATING MICHAEL TO
MORE THAN 30 KT BY 48 HR.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS WESTERLIES ENCROACHING ON MICHAEL...AND
BOTH SATELLITE AND AIRCRAFT DATA HINT THAT SHEARING IS BEGINNING. 
LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THAT THE SHEAR SHOULD STEADILY INCREASE
AS MICHAEL MOVES NORTHEASTWARD INTO COOLER WATER.  THIS SHOULD CAUSE
THE STORM TO WEAKEN...AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE INTENSITY
FORECAST.  MICHAEL SHOULD LOSE TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS BY 48 HR AND
MERGE WITH THE BAROCLINIC LOW BY 72 HR.  WHILE SOME STORMS THAT
INTERACT WITH THE WESTERLIES STRENGTHEN AS THEY ACCELERATE...THE
GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THESE WESTERLIES SHOULD PRODUCE TOO MUCH SHEAR TO
ALLOW MICHAEL TO DO THAT.

34 KT AND 50 KT WIND RADII HAVE BEEN EXPANDED IN THE EASTERN
SEMICIRCLE BASED ON AIRCRAFT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 60 KT 75 NM EAST
OF THE CENTER.

AN EYE IS NO LONGER APPARENT.  THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
MICHAEL IS BECOMING DISTORTED...AND WESTERLY SHEAR APPEARS TO BE
INCREASING OVER THE SYSTEM.  I AM KEEPING THE CYCLONE AT HURRICANE
STRENGTH PENDING THE 18Z RECON MISSION...WHICH MAY REVEAL THAT
WEAKENING IS UNDERWAY.  MICHAEL IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN MERGING WITH A
POLAR FRONT CYCLONE NEAR THE CANADIAN MARITIMES IN A DAY OR SO.

BECAUSE OF THE SHEAR...CENTER FIXES ARE LESS RELIABLE SINCE THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER IS PROBABLY DISPLACED TO THE WEST OF THE UPPER-LEVEL
ONE.  INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 030/8.  THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS
ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE.  THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH CURRENTLY
OVER THE OHIO VALLEY IS FORECAST TO AMPLIFY OVER THE NORTHEASTERN
U.S. AND THE ASSOCIATED STEERING FLOW ON THE EAST SIDE OF THIS
TROUGH SHOULD WHISK MICHAEL NORTHEASTWARD.   

THE WIND RADII ARE EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY IN THE FORECAST AS THE
SYSTEM TAKES ON EXTRATROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS.

TROUGH MOVING OFF THE UPPER U.S. EAST COAST.  CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES

MEASUREMENTS WITHIN THE PAST 6-8 HOURS.  HOWEVER...AS WATER
TEMPERATURES COOL AND CONVECTION DIMINISHES MICHAEL SHOULD WEAKEN

ASSOCIATED LOW FORMING JUST SOUTH OF WESTERN NOVA SCOTIA.  MICHAEL
SHOULD MERGE WITH THIS LOW...WITH THE MAIN QUESTIONS BEING EXACTLY
WHERE AND WHEN.  LARGE-SCALE MODEL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THE MERGER
COULD OCCUR IN LESS THAN 24 HR.  SINCE MICHAEL IS STRONGER THAN
INDICATED BY THE MODELS...IT MAY KEEP ITS IDENTITY A LITTLE LONGER
OR BECOME THE PREDOMINANT CENTER IN THE MERGER.  THE FORECAST TRACK
ASSUMES THAT MICHAEL WILL KEEP ITS IDENTITY WHILE LOSING TROPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS...TAKING THE CENTER TO NEAR SOUTHEASTERN
NEWFOUNDLAND IN ABOUT 24 HR.  THIS SCENARIO AGREES WITH THAT OF THE
CANADIAN HURRICANE CENTER.  AN ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS THAT IF
MICHAEL AND THE NON-TROPICAL LOW MERGE EARLIER THAN CURRENTLY
FORECAST...THE COMBINED CENTER WILL TRACK TO THE LEFT OF THE CURRENT
FORECAST.

REGARDLESS OF EXACTLY HOW OR WHERE MICHAEL AND THE LOW COME
TOGETHER...THE STRONG DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL

THE CENTER OF THE DEPRESSION IS HARD TO LOCATE...ALTHOUGH AN SSMI
PASS AT 22Z SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT THE INITIAL MOTION...030/11...
IS NOT AS FAST AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 30 KT...AND THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH
RECENT SHIP REPORTS AND A QUIKSCAT PASS.  

THE DEPRESSION IS EMBEDDED IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE
SAME TROUGH THAT JUST ATE MICHAEL.  THE AVN AND UKMET PULL THE
TROUGH OUT AHEAD OF THE DEPRESSION AND ALLOW SOME RIDGING TO THE
EAST OF THE CYCLONE IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT SHORT WAVE FORECAST TO
MOVE OFF THE NORTH AMERICAN COAST IN 42-48 HOURS.  THE GFDL REACTS
TO THIS BY TURNING THE TRACK A LITTLE TO THE LEFT LATE IN THE
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST HINTS AT THIS BUT IS TO THE RIGHT OF
THE GFDL.

AS WE WERE WITH MICHAEL...WE ARE FACED WITH HAVING TO ASSESS HOW THE
SYSTEM WILL RESPOND TO THE SHEAR ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE UPPER
TROUGH.  THIS CYCLONE IS NOT FORECAST TO ACCELERATE AS FAST AS
MICHAEL...SUGGESTING THAT THE SHEAR MIGHT BE A LITTLE HIGHER WITH
THIS SYSTEM.  THIS SYSTEM IS ALSO EXPECTED TO BE FARTHER FROM ANY
MID-LATITUDE BAROCLINIC SOURCES OF ENERGY.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST

TROPICAL DEPRESSION EIGHTEEN IS ALMOST A TROPICAL STORM.  SHIP VRWK5
REPORTED 33 KT ABOUT 105 NM ESE OF THE CENTER AT 06Z...AND SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 35 KT.  ON THE OTHER
HAND...THE CONVECTION IS LOOKING A LITTLE RAGGED OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS...AND IT IS NOT CERTAIN WHERE THE CENTER IS IN RELATION TO THE
CONVECTION.  ALSO...THE INTENSITY ESTIMATE FROM AFWA IS 25 KT.  THE
CYCLONE WILL REMAIN A DEPRESSION FOR NOW.  FIRST-LIGHT VISIBLE
IMAGERY SHOULD RESOLVE THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE CENTER.

THE INITIAL POSITION COMPROMISES BETWEEN MORE NORTHERLY FIXES OF
TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA...AND A MORE SOUTHERLY POSITION FROM A 0119Z
SSM/I OVERPASS.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS 035/11.  SATELLITE IMAGERY
INDICATES THAT A DEEP LAYER TROUGH...INCLUDING THE REMAINS OF
MICHAEL...COVERS THE NORTHWEST ATLANTIC.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS AGREE
THAT THIS TROUGH WILL BY-PASS THE CYCLONE...LEAVING IT TO BE PICKED
UP BY A SECOND TROUGH DEVELOPING IN 36 TO 72 HR.  THIS PATTERN
SHOULD PRODUCE A GENERALLY NORTHEASTWARD TRACK THROUGH 36 TO 48
HR...WITH SOME TURN TO THE LEFT THEREAFTER.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS SHIFTED LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...PARTICULARLY AFTER 48 HR. 
THIS IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE AVN AND UKMET ON THE LEFT...AND THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST AND THE GFDL ON THE RIGHT.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS TRICKY.  THE ENVIRONMENT IS CURRENTLY
FAVORABLE...WITH AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE CYCLONE AND A JET
STREAM TO THE NORTHWEST PROVIDING OUTFLOW.  HOWEVER...LARGE-SCALE
MODELS SUGGEST THAT STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE
SYSTEM IN ABOUT 24 HR.  ADDITIONALLY...SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A
COLD FRONT IS APPROACHING THE CYCLONE.  THIS COMBINATION SHOULD STOP
STRENGTHENING...AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST.  AT
ABOUT 48 HR...THE CYCLONE MAY COME UNDER THE RIGHT REAR QUADRANT OF
A JET STREAM TO THE EAST OF A SHARP...POSSIBLY NEGATIVELY TILTED
UPPER TROUGH.  THIS BRINGS UP THE POSSIBILITY OF BAROCLINICALLY-
INDUCED STRENGTHENING AS HAPPENED WITH MICHAEL.  THE FORECAST WILL
NOT YET REFLECT THIS...AS IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE FORCING FROM THE
TROUGH WILL OVERCOME THE STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR.  IN ANY CASE...THE
CYCLONE SHOULD LOSE TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS BY 72 HR OVER THE COLD
WATERS OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC.

THE FORECAST WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED OVER THE SOUTHEAST
QUADRANT BASED ON THE SHIP REPORT AND THE EXPECTED MOTION.

SUGGESTED BY RECENT QUICKSCAT AND SSMI DATA AS WELL AS VISIBLE
IMAGERY.  PERHAPS THE CENTER HAS TANGLED WITH A COLD FRONT. 
MEANWHILE AN IMPRESSIVE CDO FEATURE HAS DEVELOPED AND THE WINDS ARE
INCREASED TO 40 KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS FOR MODEST
STRENGTHENING TO 50 KNOTS FOLLOWING THE SHIPS MODEL...WHICH
INDICATES STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR AND COLD SSTS AHEAD.  THE GFDL
FORECASTS WINDS TO NEAR 70 KNOTS.  THESE FORECASTS FOR
INTENSIFICATION ARE LIKELY BASED ON BAROCLINIC FORCING RATHER THAN
TROPICAL ENERGY SOURCES SINCE THERE IS STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR AND
COLD SSTS ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK.   EXTRATROPICAL TRANSFORMATION
IS EXPECTED BY 48 HOURS IF NOT SOONER.

TROPICAL STORM NADINE DISCUSSION NUMBER   6
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT FRI OCT 20 2000
 
TROPICAL STORM NADINE HAS INTENSIFIED BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF AT LEAST 45 KT...T3.0...FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB...AND
ALSO AN EYE-LIKE FEATURE NOW APPARENT IN BOTH INFRARED AND SSMI
MICROWAVE DATA.  A NEW BURST OF STRONG CONVECTION HAS ALSO DEVELOPED
IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT OF THE CENTER AND THIS IS THE REASON FOR
INCREASING THE INITIAL INTENSITY TO 50 KT.  OUTFLOW IS IMPRESSIVE
WITH TRANSVERSE CIRRUS BANDING NOTED IN THE NORTHWEST SEMICIRCLE...
ALSO INDICATIVE OF AN INTENSIFYING TROPICAL CYCLONE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 045/16. NADINE MADE AN EAST-NORTHEAST
JOG DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS AS A SHARP MID-LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH
HAS IMPINGED ON THE SYSTEM FROM THE WEST.  HOWEVER...WITH SUCH A
HIGH-AMPLITUDE RIDGE PRESENT TO THE EAST AS SEEN IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY...NADINE SHOULD RESUME A MORE NORTHEASTLY MOTION AND
GRADUALLY INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED THROUGH 36 HOURS...WITH MORE
RAPID ACCELERATION AFTERWARDS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A LITTLE
RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND CLOSE TO THE UKMET AND GFDL MODELS.
 
BASED ON THE APPEARANCE OF A POSSIBLE EYE FEATURE AND THE CURRENT
IMPRESSSIVE OUTFLOW PATTERN...IT IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT
NADINE COULD REACH MINIMAL HURRICANE INTENSITY WITHIN THE NEXT 12 TO
24 HOURS.  HOWEVER...SURFACE ANALYSES AND SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS
FROM TAFB INDICATE THAT A COLD FRONT LIES JUST NORTHWEST OF NADINE. 
MERGER WITH THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY CAUSING EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION
SHOULD BEGIN WITHIN 36 TO 48 HOURS...IF NOT SOONER.  THE INTENSITY
IS ONLY BROUGHT DOWN SLIGHTLY DUE TO STRONG BAROCLINIC EFFECTS...
WHICH COULD EVEN INTENSIFY THE SYSTEM SOME AFTER EXTRATROPICAL
TRANSITION OCCURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 055/17.  THE HEADING HAS TURNED 20
DEGREES TO THE RIGHT IN THE PAST 12 HOURS AND THE FORWARD MOTION HAS
INCREASED.  THIS IS BELIEVED TO BE DUE TO THE LOW TO THE NORTH WHICH
IS FORECAST TO BYPASS THE STORM.  NADINE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE
TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT SHORT WAVE FOR ANY FURTHER INCREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED AND A SLIGHT TURN BACK TO THE LEFT.  THE AVIATION MODEL MOVES
THE NEXT EXTRATROPICAL SYSTEM FROM THE GREAT LAKES REGION TO NEAR
NEWFOUNDLAND IN 48 HOURS.  OTHERWISE THE FORECAST SCENARIO REMAINS
AS BEFORE...ACCELERATING NADINE NORTHEASTWARD FROM 24 TO 72 HOURS.  

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THE SYSTEM LOOKING LIKE A FRONTAL WAVE AND
THE COLD FRONT MAY WELL BE INTERACTING WITH THE LOW LEVEL
CIRCULATION BY NOW.  BUT DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND
SAB ARE 55 AND 45 KNOTS.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST REMAINS ABOUT THE
SAME AS LAST ADVISORY...INCREASING THE WIND FROM 50 TO TO 60 KNOTS
BUT AS AN EXTRATROPICAL SYSTEM IN 24 HOURS.  THE SHIPS MODEL DOES
THE SAME AND THE GFDL MODEL HAS AN EXTRATROPICAL 64 KNOTS IN 48

DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE STORM HAS BECOME RATHER RAGGED-
LOOKING...AND THE CENTER IS NEAR THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE DENSE
OVERCAST.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE UNCHANGED SO THE INITIAL
WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS.  SINCE THE SYSTEM IS NOT VERY WELL-
ORGANIZED LOOKING AT THIS TIME...ONLY SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST AS THE CYCLONE BEGINS THE EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION IN A DAY
OR SO.  WE COULD SEE MORE INTENSIFICATION THAN SHOWN HERE...DUE TO
BAROCLINIC PROCESSES...OR BECAUSE OF A MERGER WITH ANOTHER
EXTRATROPICAL LOW AS WAS THE CASE WITH MICHAEL.  HOWEVER WE HAVE
LITTLE SKILL IN FORECASTING SUCH EVENTS.

INITIAL MOTION IS ABOUT 045/17.   SIGNIFICANT ACCELERATION SHOULD
BEGIN IN A DAY OR SO AS A 500 MB TROUGH...CURRENTLY NEAR THE EASTERN
GREAT LAKES... MOVES INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND CREATES AN
INCREASING NORTHEASTWARD STEERING CURRENT FOR NADINE.  THE OFFICIAL

EARLIER POSITION ESTIMATES WERE APPARENTLY BASED ON A MID-LEVEL
CENTER...WHICH...BECAUSE OF VERTICAL SHEAR...WAS DISPLACED NORTHEAST
OF THE SURFACE CENTER.  AS A RESULT THE EARLIER ESTIMATED FORWARD
MOTION WAS TOO FAST TO THE NORTHEAST.  NADINE IS RELOCATED ON THIS

SLOWER INITIAL MOTION...NUMERICAL GUIDANCE STILL CALLS FOR
CONSIDERABLE ACCELERATION IN A DAY OR SO AS A LARGE MID-LEVEL TROUGH
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE LATEST U.K. MET OFFICE AND GFDL GUIDANCE.

WITH THE SHEARING AND SOME DRY AIR INTRUSION...THE SYSTEM HAS BECOME
LESS ORGANIZED...DEEP CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED...AND CURRENT
INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 45 KNOTS.  ASIDE FROM A POSSIBLE BAROCLINIC-
TYPE INTENSIFICATION...RE-STRENGTHENING SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS TIME.

DATA FROM THE NOAA-15 ADVANCED MICROWAVE SOUNDER UNIT...AMSU...
INDICATE THAT NADINE STILL HAS A WEAK WARM CORE...EVEN THOUGH THE

DUE TO INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR AND DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT... 
THERE IS NO DEEP CONVECTION WITHIN 100 NM OF THE NOW FULLY EXPOSED
LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER.  NADINE IS QUICKLY TRANSITIONING TO AN
EXTRA-TROPICAL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AS IT INTERACTS WITH A NEARBY
COLD FRONT.  IN FACT...THE INFRARED SATELLITE DEPICTION IS
STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO AN OCCLUDED MID-LATITUDE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.
HOWEVER...THE INTENSITY WAS KEPT AT 45 KT BASED ON A 21/2226Z
QUIKSCAT OVERPASS INDICATING 40 TO 45 KT UNCONTAMINATED WINDS AND 50
KT RAIN-CONTAMINATED WINDS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CIRCULATION.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 040/15.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR REASONING.  SATELLITE POSITION
ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN COMING IN ON TOP OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...SO THE
OFFICIAL TRACK IS JUST A BLEND OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND THE
LATEST MARINE PREDICTION CENTER...MPC...FORECAST TRACK.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK IS TO THE LEFT OF AND FASTER THAN THE GFDL AND 
UKMET MODELS...AND CLOSE TO THE AVN MODEL.
 
NADINE IS ENCOUNTERING SIGNIFICANT SHEAR AND DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT ON
THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF A STRONG NEGATIVELY-TILTED DIFFLUENT TROUGH.
DUE TO THE SHEAR...MID-LEVEL DRY AIR AND COOL OCEAN WATER...
REDEVELOPMENT OF ANY SIGNIFICANT DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE SYSTEM
CENTER IS UNLIKELY.  NADINE SHOULD CONTINUE THE RAPID TRANSITION TO
AN EXTRATROPICAL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND... ASIDE FROM A POSSIBLE
BAROCLINIC-TYPE INTENSIFICATION...RE-STRENGTHENING SEEMS UNLIKELY AT

FIRST VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING AND SHIP REPORTS
INDICATE THAT THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SOUTH OF ACAPULCO HAS BECOME
BETTER ORGANIZED AND IS NOW A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...THE FIRST OF THE
2000 EAST PACIFIC SEASON.  

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 295/11...NOT FAR FROM THE
CLIMATOLOGICAL MEAN.  A MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM
IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A GENERALLY WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION OVER
THE NEXT 2-3 DAYS.  THIS SHOULD KEEP THE SYSTEM OFF THE MEXICAN
COAST.  IN THE LONGER RANGE...A MAJOR TROUGH OFF THE BAJA CALIFORNIA
COAST COULD INDUCE A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK IF THE SYSTEM STRENGTHENS
AS FORECAST.  

THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS ESTIMATED TO BE 30 KT.  THE PRESENTATION ON
BOTH IR AND VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY HAS BEEN IMPROVING THROUGHOUT
THE MORNING...WITH BANDING IN THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE.  THE LOW-
LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER IS EMBEDDED IN THE DEEP CONVECTION BUT

THERE HAS BEEN A GRADUAL INCREASE IN ORGANIZATION OF THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE...WITH ENOUGH BANDING FEATURES ON THE SATELLITE IMAGES TO
YIELD A DATA T-NUMBER OF 2.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE.  THIS EQUATES TO
MINIMAL STORM STRENGTH...SO THE SYSTEM IS BEING NAMED.  HIGH CLOUD

NORTH OF THE STORM.  SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND VERTICAL SHEAR
FAVOR SLOW STRENGTHENING FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. LATE IN THE

TEMPERATURES SHOULD COOL SLIGHTLY.

TO THE WEST OF BAJA IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD DURING

AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  T-NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED
TO 3.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...EQUIVALENT TO 45-KNOT WINDS.  ALTHOUGH
THE SHIPS MODEL STRENGTHENS ALETTA TO 75 KNOTS MAINLY DUE TO WARM
WATERS...THE GFDL...UK AND AVN MODELS SUGGEST WEAKENING BY THE END
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD AS THE CIRCULATION BECOMES ABSORBED BY A
TROUGH OR BECOMES ILL DEFINED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONTINUES TO
SHOW A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING BUT NOT AS MUCH AS SHIPS.

GLOBAL MODELS INSIST ON WEAKENING THE STEERING CURRENTS BEYOND 36
HOURS. THIS WOULD RESULT IN LITTLE MOTION OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS ALETTA ON A GENERAL AND SLOW WESTWARD
TRACK BUT WITH A MARKED DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED BY THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT IS HARD TO
IGNORE THE AVN...UK AND GFDL MODELS.

ALETTA IS MOVING SLOWLY WESTWARD.  STEERING CURRENTS ARE FORECAST BY
THE AVIATION MODEL TO REMAIN WEAK WITH A CUTOFF LOW LOCATED WEST OF
BAJA CALIFORNIA MOVING SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
MOVES THE STORM SLOWLY WESTWARD FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.

THERE IS A PERSISTANT CDO FEATURE AND GOOD BANDING WAS EVIDENT ON
THE LAST VISIBLE IMAGERY.  DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
SUGGEST SOME STRENGTHENING AND THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 50

8 AM PDT WED MAY 24 2000
 
ALETTA BECOMES THE FIRST HURRICANE OF THE 2000 EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC
HURRICANE SEASON. 

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND KGWC INDICATE THAT THE
T-NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED TO 4.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...EQUIVALENT TO
65 KNOTS OR HURRICANE INTENSITY.  ALETTA HAS A LARGE AREA OF CENTRAL
DEEP CONVECTION AND A WELL DEFINED CURVED BAND TO THE WEST. THE
OUTFLOW IS FAIR BUT RESTRICTED TO THE NORTHEAST.  SHIPS INTENSITY
FORECAST MODEL...THE BEST PERFORMER SO FAR...BRINGS ALETTA TO 80
KNOTS BY 48 TO 60 HOURS AND THEN INDICATES NO CHANGE. SHIPS
INDICATES THAT THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION TO STRENGTHENING COMES FROM
WARM SST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BASICALLY SHIPS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 270/05. A WARM HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER MEXICO IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST AND THE TROUGH OVER BAJA CALIFORNIA IS
WEAKENING. THIS PATTERN WOULD FORCE ALETTA TO MOVE ON A VERY SLOW
WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS AND THIS IS INDICATED IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.  HOWEVER...TRACK MODELS ARE SUGGESTING ALL
DIRECTIONS AND SPEEDS. GFDL TAKE ALETTA EASTWARD...AVN LOOPS THE
HURRICANE WHILE THE BAM MODELS MOVE THE HURRICANE WEST-SOUTHWEST AT
A FASTER PACE.

HURRICANE ALETTA HAS BECOME A LITTLE BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE
PAST 6 HOURS. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE
DVORAK T4.5 (75 KT) AND T4.0 (65 KT)...RESPECTIVELY. VISIBLE IMAGERY
ALSO INDICATES A CLOUD-FILLED EYE HAS BECOME APPARENT OVER THE PAST
2 HOURS AND THIS IS CONFIRMED BY A 30 NM DIAMETER EYE SHOWN IN A
1609Z TRMM OVERPASS IMAGE. AS A RESULT...WE HAVE INCREASED THE
INTENSITY SLIGHTLY. OUTFLOW IS MAINLY CONFINED TO ONE POLEWARD
CHANNEL...BUT THE SYSTEM HAS BECOME MORE CIRCULAR AND SYMMETRICAL
ALSO SUGGESTING SOME STRENGTHENING HAS OCCURRED. THE SHIPS INTENSITY
MODEL INDICATES SLOW BUT STEADY INTENSIFICATION TO 88 KT THROUGH 48
HOURS AND THEN LEVELS OFF AFTER THAT. WE HAVE FOLLOWED THAT TREND
THROUGH 48 HOURS WITH SLIGHT WEAKENING BY 72 HOURS BASED ON ALETTA
REMAINING OVER WARM SSTS AND IN WEAK VERTICAL SHEAR.

CURRENT MOTION IS 280/05. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DIVERGENCE AMONG THE
MODELS. WE ARE NOT READY TO BUY OFF ON THE UKMET AND GFDL SOLUTIONS
OF SLIGHT RECURVATURE SINCE THE MID-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE NORTHWEST IS
FORECAST TO WEAKEN AND LIFT OUT AFTER 36 HOURS ALLOWING THE MEXICAN
WARM HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO BUILD WESTWARD. AS A RESULT...WE ARE
FORECASTING A SLIGHT POLEWARD BEND IN THE TRACK AND DECREASE IN

HURRICANE ALETTA HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND HAS
RAPIDLY INTENSIFIED DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS. SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE DVORAK T5.0 (90 KT) AND T4.5 (75
KT)...RESPECTIVELY. THE CDO HAS BECOME BETTER DEFINED WHILE TOPS
NEAR THE SYSTEM CENTER HAVE COOLED TO -85 TO -88C. THE EYE IS NO
LONGER APPARENT IN VISIBLE AND IR IMAGERY...BUT A 1649Z SSMI
OVERPASS CLEARLY INDICATED A WELL-DEFINED CLOSED EYEWALL SO WE HAVE
INCREASED THE INITIAL INTENSITY TO 80 KT.  OUTFLOW HAS IMPROVED TO
THE WEST BUT HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY RESTRICTED TO THE EAST DUE TO
INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR. HOWEVER...THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL
CONTINUES STEADY INTENSIFICATION TO 95 KT THROUGH 36 HOURS WITH
GRADUAL AFTERWARDS AS ALETTA APPROACHES COOLER SSTS (26C) BY 72
HOURS. WE HAVE FOLLOWED SHIPS CLOSELY BUT HAVE HELD DOWN THE
INTENSITY SLIGHTLY DUE TO POSSIBLE ENTRAINMENT OF LOW-LEVEL STABLE
CLOUDS TO THE WEST AS INDICATED IN LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY.
 
CURRENT MOTION IS 280/07 AND THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE DIVERGENCE
IN OUR FORECAST MODELS. THE GFDL HAS HAD A PERSISENT SHARP RIGHT OF
TRACK BIAS AND SLIGHT RECURVATURE FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS SO WE HAVE
DISCOUNTED THE LATEST GFDL SOLUTION. THE UKMET AND NOGAPS ARE
SIMILAR TO THE GFDL..ALBEIT TO A LESSER EXTENT...IN ALETTA GAINING
LATITUDE AFTER 12 TO 24 HOURS. THE NUMERICAL MODELS DO NOT APPEAR TO
BE HANDLING WELL THE 700 TO 200 MB HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE INDICATED IN
SYNOPTIC AND SATELLITE DATA CENTERED NEAR MANZANILLO AND EXTENDING
WESTWARD TO AT LEAST SOCORRO ISLAND. WITH SUCH DEEP MID- TO UPPER-

INFRARED IMAGES SHOW A FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL CLOUD PATTERN OF STRONG
CONVECTION AROUND THE ESTIMATED CENTER.  EVEN THOUGH CIRRUS-LEVEL
OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO BE SOMEWHAT INHIBITED TO THE EAST...OVERALL THE
SYSTEM APPEARS WELL-ORGANIZED.  USING THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE WITH THE

KNOTS WHICH WILL BE USED FOR THIS ADVISORY.  IT IS RATHER UNUSUAL TO
HAVE SUCH A STRONG TROPICAL CYCLONE IN THE EAST PACIFIC DURING THE
MONTH OF MAY.  SOME MORE INTENSIFICATION COULD OCCUR TODAY BUT SEA
SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO COOL GRADUALLY...ESPECIALLY IN

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CLEARLY SHOWS A MID-TROPOSPHERIC VORTICITY
MAXIMUM NEAR THE BAJA/U.S. BORDER WITH AN ACCOMPANYING TROUGH
EXTENDED SOUTH-SOUTHWESTWARD FOR A FEW HUNDRED MILES.  THIS FEATURE

WHILE DEVELOPING A NEW TROPICAL CYCLONE VERY CLOSE BY.  THIS COULD
BE THE REPRESENTATION OF ALETTA IN THE MODEL.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
CALLS FOR A GRADUAL WEAKENING...BASED ON PERSISTENCE.   

ALETTA HAS BARELY MOVED SINCE YESTERDAY.  MODELS HAVE NOT CHANGED
FROM PREVIOUS RUNS SO I DO NOT HAVE TO DISCUSS THEM AGAIN. ALETTA IS
FORECAST TO REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.
THEREAFTER...A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION SHOULD BEGIN ONCE A NEW
HIGH DEVELOPS TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE AS INDICATED BY
GLOBAL MODELS.

INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN IS ON A WEAKENING TREND.  BOTH SSMI

ALETTA HAS REMAINED NEARLY STATIONARY DURING THE PAST 12 TO 24 HOURS
AND LITTLE MOTION IS ANTICIPATED.  HOWEVER...WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF
A RIDGE TO THE NORTH IN ABOUT 48 HOURS...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE SHOULD
BEGIN A SLOW WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK.  MODELS ARE NOW IN BETTER

ALTHOUGH SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA
ARE 77 KT...65 KT...AND 55 KT RESPECTIVELY...SATELLITE IMAGERY
INDICATES THE CENTER OF ALETTA HAS BECOME EXPOSED NORTHEAST OF THE
CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON. THUS THE CYCLONE IS DOWNGRADED TO A
60 KT TROPICAL STORM.

THE CENTER IS A LITTLE FURTHER EAST THAN IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS IS MOVEMENT OR A BETTER CENTER POSITION.
THE INITIAL MOTION IS THUS STATIONARY. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES
A MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH HAS FORMED NORTH OF ALETTA...WHICH HAS
COLLAPSED THE STEERING CURRENTS. THE AVN...UKMET...AND NOGAPS MODELS
HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE TROUGH...AND SUGGEST IT SHOULD BE REPLACED
BY A RIDGE IN 36-48 HR. THIS WOULD ALLOW A FASTER MOTION TOWARD THE
WEST OR NORTHWEST. NHC TRACK GUIDANCE REMAINS DIVERGENT...ALTHOUGH
THE UKMET AND NOGAPS GENERALLY AGREE WITH THIS SCENARIO. THE GFDL
TRACKS ALETTA SLOWLY TOWARD THE NORTHEAST...WHICH LOOKS UNLIKELY
GIVEN THE DEVELOPING SYNOPTIC PATTERN. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST DUE TO
CURRENT INITIAL POSITION.

THE SHEARING UPPER LEVEL EASTERLIES ARE NOT WELL HANDLED IN THE
MODELS...WITH THE AVN...NOGAPS...AND UKMET SHOWING LESS FLOW
AFFECTING ALETTA THAN INDICATED BY SATELLITE IMAGERY. THESE MODELS
INDICATE THE SHEAR SHOULD WEAKEN OVER THE NEXT 24-36 HR... WHICH
WOULD ALLOW ALETTA TO MAINTAIN ITSELF OR PERHAPS RE-INTENSIFY.  THE
AVN-BASED SHIPS MODEL FOLLOWS THIS IDEA AND SHOWS LITTLE CHANGE IN
STRENGTH FOR 48 HR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST INDICATES LITTLE CHANGE
THROUGH 24 HR...FOLLOWED BY WEAKENING AS ALETTA MOVES OVER COOLER
WATERS. IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE AVN MERGES ALETTA WITH A NEW CYCLONE
FORMING TO THE EAST. WHILE THIS COULD HAPPEN EVENTUALLY...THE
DISTURBED WEATHER SOUTH OF THE GULF OF TEHUANTEPEC IS STILL POORLY
ORGANIZED.

WERE IT NOT FOR MICROWAVE SSMI IMAGERY THE LOCATION OF ALETTA WOULD
BE A COMPLETE MYSTERY TONIGHT...HOWEVER...THE OVERPASS AT 0349Z
INDICATES THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION HAS BEEN DRIFTING TO THE
NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT AND HAS SEPARATED FROM THE MID-LEVEL CLOUD
PATTERN.  THERE IS NO LONGER ANY CONVECTION NEAR THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER...AND IN FACT...ONLY THE DVORAK CONSTRAINTS ALLOW THE SYSTEM
TO BE CLASSIFIABLE.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 45 KT WITH
THIS ADVISORY.

THE TRACK GUIDANCE COVERS THE ENTIRE COMPASS...WITH THE STATISTICAL
P91E SHOWING A SOUTHEAST TRACK...THE SHALLOW BAM SOUTHWEST...THE
GFDL NORTHEAST...AND THE REMAINING MODELS...INCLUDING THE UKMET AND
NOGAPS...INDICATING A NORTHWEST TRACK.  THE GFDL SEEMS TO HAVE HAD
THE BEST HANDLE ON THIS SYSTEM OVER THE PAST DAY OR TWO...AND THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED TOWARD THE GFDL AND IS TO THE RIGHT OF
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  LATER IN THE PERIOD THE FORECAST TRACK TURNS
BACK TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE FORECAST
STRENGTHENING OF THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE IN THE GLOBAL MODELS.

IN SPITE OF THE RAPID WEAKENING OF ALETTA TODAY...30 KT IN 24
HOURS...THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL SHOWS ONLY MODEST
ADDITIONAL WEAKENING...AND IN FACT INDICATES SOME RESTRENGTHENING
LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  ONCE AGAIN...THE AVN SEEMS TO BE TOO
AGGRESSIVE WITH THE SPIN-UP OF THE SYSTEM BEHIND ALETTA...AND SO THE
DYNAMICAL INPUTS TO SHIPS MAY BE QUESTIONABLE.  THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY FORECAST DOES NOT BUY THE REINTENSIFICATION...AND IF
ALETTA CANNOT REGENERATE ANY CONVECTION IT WILL DISSIPATE SOONER
RATHER THAN LATER.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWO-E HAS BEEN TRACKING AT 290/07 THE PAST 6
HOURS. THE INITIAL POSITION WAS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE EAST BASED
ON EARLIER SSMI AND TRMM IMAGES...AND VISIBLE ANIMATIONS. THESE
IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER IS DISPLACED
NORTHEAST OF THE STRONGEST CONVECTION. INITIAL INTENSITY IS BASED ON
DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 2.0 FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.

THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO MAINTAIN A GENERAL WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK BASED ON THE UW-CIMMS WATER VAPOR WINDS INDICATING A
DEEP LAYER SUBTROPICAL HIGH/RIDGE EXTENDING E-W ALONG 35N LATITUDE.
THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE MAJORITY OF OUR OBJECTIVE FORECAST
GUIDANCE. THE UKMET DRIFTS THE SYSTEM SLOWLY NORTHWARD AFTER 48
HOURS WHEREAS THE GFDL TAKES THE SYSTEM DUE NORTH AFTER 24 HOURS.
WITH SUCH A STRONG RIDGE TO THE NORTH...WE FEEL THAT THE CYCLONE
WILL MOVE MORE TO THE WEST THAN NORTH. SOME DECREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED IS FORECAST LATE IN THE PERIOD DUE TO WEAKENING STEERING
CURRENTS.

POLEWARD OUTFLOW HAS BECOME BETTER ESTABLISHED BASED ON HIGH CLOUD
MOTIONS. HOWEVER...THE LOW-LEVEL AND MID-LEVEL CIRCULATIONS DO NOT
APPEAR TO BE VERTICALLY ALIGNED DUE TO SOME NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR. AS
A RESULT...GRADUAL INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST THROUGH 48
HOURS...AND THEN REMAINING STEADY OR A SLIGHT DECREASE THROUGH 72
HOURS AS THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER COOLER SSTS. THIS IS IN
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL.

DVORAK ESTIMATES OF STORM STRENGTH FROM TAFB AND KGWC...AND SOME
QUICKSCAT WINDS OF 35 KNOTS EARLIER TODAY...ARE THE BASIS FOR

THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH BUD HAS NOT CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THE STRONGEST CONVECTION
IS ASSOCIATED WITH A CURVED BAND TO THE EAST OF THE CENTER AND THE
OUTFLOW IS WELL DEFINED PRIMARILY TO THE WEST.  AN AVERAGE OF THE
TAFB...SAB AND KGWC T-NUMBERS INDICATE THAT WINDS REMAIN AT 40
KNOTS.  THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON I IMAGES BUT
THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION...BASED ON CONTINUITY IS
290/08. HOWEVER...THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THE CENTER IS LOCATED A
LITTLE BIT TO THE NORTHEAST WITHIN THE CONVECTION.    

THERE IS DILEMMA. RELIABLE AND HARD TO IGNORE UK...GFDL AND GFDN
MODELS...TURN BUD NORTHWARD AND EVEN NORTH-NORTHEAST AS THE 500 MB
RIDGE TO THE NORTH WEAKENS AND A TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE WESTERN
UNITED STATES.  THIS SCENARIO COULD RESULT IN A POTENTIAL THREAT TO
SOUTHWESTERN MEXICO.  HOWEVER THE BAM AND THE AVN MODELS INDICATE A
CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST TO WEST TRACK...AWAY FROM MEXICO...BASED ON
THE PRESENCE OF A STRONGER AND A MORE PERSISTENT RIDGE FORECAST BY
THE AVN.  THIS CONTINUED WESTWARD TRACK IS ALSO SUGGESTED BY
STATISTICAL MODELS WHICH ARE GOOD PERFORMERS IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC. 
AT THIS TIME...BECAUSE OF THE UK AND GFDL AND GFDN SOLUTION...THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED A LITTLE NORTHWARD FROM THE
PREVIOUS ONE AND SLOWS BUD DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD. 

IF THIS FORECAST TRACK MATERIALIZES...BUD WILL BE MOVING OVER COOLER
WATERS BEYOND 36 HOURS AND WEAKENING COULD BEGIN.   A MORE WESTWARD
TRACK WOULD DELAY ANY WEAKENING. SHIPS MODEL SUGGESTS ONLY A MODEST
STRENGTHENING BUT IT IS BASED ON THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK WHICH
KEPT BUD OVER WARMER WATERS.

SSMI MICROWAVE IMAGERY FROM THE NRL WEB PAGE SEVERAL HOURS AGO
SHOWED THAT THE CENTER OF BUD WAS CONSIDERABLY NORTHEAST OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY POSITION.  THE CENTER IS HARD TO PINPOINT ON IR
IMAGERY...BUT THE FIRST COUPLE OF VISIBLE IMAGES THIS MORNING ALSO
SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER HAS BEEN MOVING ON A MORE NORTHWESTERLY
TRACK OVERNIGHT.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE 300/7...
BUT VISIBLE IMAGERY OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO WILL PROBABLY SHOW
THAT THE TRACK IS EVEN MORE TO THE RIGHT THAN THAT. 

TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS DECIDEDLY AMBIVALENT...WITH THE BAMS AND
STATISTICAL MODELS...WHICH ARE BASED ON THE AVN...SHOWING A TURN
TOWARDS THE WEST.  HOWEVER...THE GFDL RUN OFF THE NOGAPS FIELDS AND
THE UKMET MODEL INDICATE A SLOWING OF THE SYSTEM AND A TURN TO THE

WITH THE CURRENT MOTION.  BOTH THE AVN AND UKMET BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN
THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF BUD THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDING THE WESTWARD
STEERING CURRENT...THE UKMET MORE SO.  HOWEVER...THE MAIN DIFFERENCE
IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY MID-LEVEL FLOW TO THE
SOUTH OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS NOT PRESENT IN THE AVN.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST FAVORS THE GFDL/UKMET SOLUTION AND IS SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT
OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

SATELLITE DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS THIS MORNING FROM TAFB...SAB...AND
AFWA ARE A CONSENSUS 3.0...CORRESPONDING TO 45 KT...AND THE
INTENSITY OF BUD IS INCREASED ON THIS BASIS.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY
MODEL GUIDANCE CALLS FOR SOME STRENGTHENING OVER THE NEXT 36

OVER COOLER WATERS AND SHOULD BEGIN TO DECAY.  EVEN WITH THE

BUD HAS SHOWN LITTLE CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION OVER THE PAST 6 HR...
WITH MOST DEEP CONVECTION NEAR OR JUST SOUTH OF THE LOW LEVEL
CENTER. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE
45 KT...45 KT...AND 35 KT RESPECTIVELY. THUS...THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY
REMAINS 45 KT.

THE CENTER IS STILL A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO TRACK...AND THE BEST
ESTIMATE OF THE MOTION IS 330/7. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A
STRONG MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF BUD...WHILE LARGE-SCALE MODEL
ANALYSES SUGGEST SOME WEAKNESS AT THE LOWER LEVELS. THE MODELS
SUGGEST THE MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE SHOULD WEAKEN OVER THE NEXT 72
HR...WHICH WOULD ALLOW BUD TO SLOW DOWN AND POSSIBLY TURN NORTHWARD.
TRACK FORECAST GUIDANCE IS NOT IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO.
THE AVN-BASED GUIDANCE CALLS FOR A WESTWARD TURN AFTER 24 TO 36 HR.
THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE NOGAPS. THE GFDL CALLS FOR A NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION FOR 24 HR FOLLOWED BY A TURN TO THE EAST. THE UKMET TURNS THE
CYCLONE EASTWARD AFTER 36 HR. THE GFDN FORECAST AGREES BEST WITH THE
SYNOPTIC SITUATION ...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST AGREES BEST WITH IT.
THE CURRENT TRACK FORECAST IS SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

ON THE FORECAST TRACK...BUD SHOULD CROSS THE 26C SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURE ISOTHERM IN ABOUT 12 HR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST ALLOWS
FOR SOME SLIGHT STRENGTHENING BEFORE THIS HAPPENS...FOLLOWED BY A
STEADY WEAKENING. GIVEN THE LARGE SIZE AND GENERALLY FAVORABLE UPPER
LEVEL ENVIRONMENT...BUD IS LIKELY TO HOLD TOGETHER LONGER THAN
NORMAL OVER THE COLDER WATER. HENCE...THIS FORECAST DOES NOT CALL
FOR DISSIPATION.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK TAKES THE TROPICAL STORM VERY CLOSE TO SOCORRO

THE NORTHEAST PACIFIC WEST OF THE TROUGH AND BETWEEN THE TROUGH AND
BUD. LARGE SCALE MODELS AGREE THAT THE TROUGH SHOULD STAY NORTH OF

WHICH WERE LIMITED BY THE DVORAK CONSTRAINTS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 305/10...WHICH IS FASTER THAN
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT CARLOTTA WILL
SOON BE COMING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO
ITS NORTH THAT SHOULD DEFLECT THE TRACK A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.  HOW
SOON THIS OCCURS WILL AFFECT HOW CLOSE THE TROPICAL CYCLONE GETS TO
THE MEXICAN COAST.  THE GUIDANCE IS VERY CONSISTENT ON A TRACK
ROUGHLY PARALLEL TO THE COAST FROM 30 TO 120 MILES OFFSHORE.  THE
GFDL IS THE CLOSEST TO LAND BUT APPEARS TO HAVE DIFFICULTY
MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO...BUT
FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

INTENSITY GUIDANCE IS SPLIT THIS EVENING.  THE SHIPS MODEL BRINGS
CARLOTTA TO 83 KT IN 72 HOURS...HOWEVER...THE GFDL AND UKMET ARE NOT
IMPRESSED.  OUTFLOW APPEARS LIMITED TO THE WESTERN SIDE AT THIS
TIME.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW IN THE GULF OF
MEXICO THAT COULD LIMIT OUTFLOW TO THE NORTH...AND THE INTENSITY
FORECAST IS NOT AS AGRESSIVE AS THE SHIPS GUIDANCE.

CARLOTTA HAS A VERY IMPRESSIVE SATELLITE SIGNATURE THIS MORNING...
WITH STRONG CONVECTION (TOPS TO -88C) THAT HAS PERSISTED THROUGH THE
NORMAL DIURNAL MINIMUM. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 35 KT...
BUT ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED BY CONSTRAINTS. THE CURRENT INTENSITY WILL
BE SET TO 45 KT. IT IS NOTABLE...AND A LITTLE STRANGE...THAT SHIP
KGJD LOCATED ABOUT 80 NM NNW OF THE CENTER REPORTED WEST WINDS 11 KT
AT 06Z.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/11. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A STRONG
MID/UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER MEXICO WHICH IS FORECAST TO PERSIST
BY THE LARGE-SCALE MODELS. THIS WOULD STEER CARLOTTA ON A WEST-
NORTHWEST TO WEST TRACK. NHC TRACK GUIDANCE IS IN UNANIMOUS
AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO...WITH THE ONLY QUESTION BEING HOW
CLOSE TO THE MEXICAN COAST WILL THE STORM COME. THE GFDL FORECASTS A
CLOSE APPROACH TO THE COAST...WHILE THE UKMET STAYS FURTHER
OFFSHORE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO
EXTREMES...TRACKING ABOUT 75 NM FROM THE COAST. IT IS ALSO VERY
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

INTENSITY GUIDANCE IS NOW IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT...WITH ALL
GUIDANCE FORECASTING CARLOTTA TO BE A HURRICANE IN 24 HR OR LESS.
THE SHIPS MODELS FORECASTS A 90 KT SYSTEM BY 72 HR. GIVEN THE
IMPRESSIVE COLD CLOUD TOPS AND THE FAVORABLE EASTERLY UPPER LEVEL
WINDS FORECAST BY THE LARGE SCALE MODELS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST
HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. THERE IS A CHANCE
CARLOTTA COULD STRENGTHEN MORE THAN EVEN SHIPS FORECASTS...IF THE
CYCLONE DOES NOT GET TOO TANGLED UP WITH THE MEXICAN COAST.

THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO HAS EXTENDED THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING
WESTWARD TO ZIHUATANEJO. THEY HAVE ALSO ISSUED A HURRICANE WATCH IN
CASE CARLOTTA COMES CLOSER TO THE COAST THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.

THE INFLUENCE OF A RIDGE OVER NORTHERN MEXICO.  THE 06Z AVIATION

ENOUGH TO THE COAST TO REQUIRE THE HURRICANE WATCH...WHICH COULD BE
CHANGED TO A WARNING IF CARLOTTA CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN.

TAFB AND SAB INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN AT 35 KNOTS DUE TO DVORAK
RESTRAINTS WHILE KGWC GIVES 55 KNOTS.  THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED
TO 50 KNOTS BASED ON THE PERSISTENCE OF AN IMPRESSIVE CDO AND AS A

TROPICAL STORM CARLOTTA HAS STRENGTHENED AND ACCELERATED DURING THE
PAST 6 HOURS. INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14 OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS...BUT
CLOSER TO 16 KT OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS. A RAGGED BANDING EYE FEATURE
HAS APPEARED IN SATELLITE IMAGERY AND THIS IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR
BRINGING THE INTENSITY UP TO JUST BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH.
 
CARLOTTA HAS TURNED MORE WESTWARD THIS AFTERNOON AND NONE OF OUR
GUIDANCE MODELS TAKE THE CYCLONE OVER LAND ANY LONGER. THE GFDL HAS
HAD A RIGHT OF TRACK BIAS...PROBABLY DUE TO A BOGUS LOW THE AVN
MODEL THAT DEVELOPS ABOUT 10 DEGREES SOUTHWEST OF CARLOTTA. NONE OF
THE OTHER MODELS HAVE THIS FEATURE.  THE UKMET HAS ONCE AGAIN BEEN
THE BEST PERFORMING MODEL AND WE HAVE FOLLOWED THAT SCENARIO CLOSELY
GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OVER
MEXICO.
 
TAFB AND KGWC SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 3.5 AND LATEST
INFRARED IMAGES SHOW TWO WELL-DEFINED COLD OVERSHOOTING TOPS ON
EITHER SIDE OF THE EYE FEATURE. THIS PATTERN OFTEN INDICATES THE
ONSET OF RAPID INTENSIFICATION AND WE HAVE TAKEN THE INTENSITY UP TO
90 KT IN 36 HOURS IN LINE WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL.
HOWEVER...100 KT IN 24 HOURS WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING GIVEN THE
IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW IN THE SOUTHERN SEMICIRCLE. AFTER 36 HOURS...ALL
THE GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE INCREASING NORTHEASTERLY 200 MB WINDS
WHICH SHOULD INDUCE SOME SHEAR ON CARLOTTA...AND THIS IS REFLECTED
IN A GENERAL LEVELING OFF OF THE INTENSITY AT 48 HOURS.
 
ALSO...THE 34-KT WIND AND 12 FT SEAS RADII WERE SIGNIFICANTLY
INCREASED BASED ON 18Z OBSERVATIONS FROM SHIPS KAOU AND KGJD...AND A

THE BEGINNINGS OF AN EYE COULD BE SEEN ON THE LAST FEW VISIBLE
SATELLITE IMAGES...AND A WARM SPOT HAS BEEN GENERALLY PRESENT ON IR
IMAGERY SINCE THEN.  DEEP CONVECTION DECREASED MARKEDLY IN AREAL
COVERAGE SINCE THIS AFTERNOON BUT HAS STABILIZED OF LATE.  OUTFLOW
IS EXCELLENT TO THE SOUTH AND WEST BUT LIMITED TO THE NORTH. 
SATELLITE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE A UNANIMOUS 65 KT.

THE FORWARD SPEED FLUCTUATED SOME THIS AFTERNOON...BUT A
REPRESENTATIVE CURRENT MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 280/11.  THIS MORE
WESTWARD TRACK IS LESSENING THE THREAT TO MEXICO...AND RAINFALL
ASSOCIATED WITH CARLOTTA IS MOSTLY OFFSHORE.  THE UKMET GLOBAL MODEL
SHOWS A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE TO THE NORTH OF
THE SYSTEM THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  ALL THE NORMALLY RELIABLE
GUIDANCE...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE GFDL...KEEPS THE HURRICANE
SAFELY OFFSHORE.  THE GFDL INDICATES A TRACK VERY CLOSE TO THE COAST
BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN A GOOD PERFORMER ON THIS STORM SO FAR.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST.

CARLOTTA HAS STRENGTHENED 30 KT IN 24 HOURS...AND THE SHIPS MODEL
GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE HURRICANE WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN AT
NEARLY THIS PACE FOR ANOTHER 24 HOURS.  WITH A CONVECTIVE PATTERN
LESS VIGOROUS THAN 24 HOURS AGO...IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THIS PACE

POORLY-DEFINED EYE. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...
SAB...AND AFWA ARE 77 KT...77 KT...AND 65 KT RESPECTIVELY. THE
MAXIMUM WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 75 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY. IT IS
NOTABLE THAT MOST IMAGES FROM THE MEXICAN RADAR AT ACAPULCO HAVE
SHOWN ONLY 50-60% OF AN EYEWALL AROUND THE EYE DURING THE NIGHT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 275/11. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE
MID/UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE CENTERED NEAR MAZATLAN MEXICO AND A
TROUGH N OF 20N BETWEEN 115W-120W. LARGE SCALE MODELS SUGGEST THESE
FEATURES SHOULD PERSIST TO SOME DEGREE FOR THE NEXT 72 HR. THIS
SHOULD ALLOW CARLOTTA TO MAINTAIN A WESTWARD OR WEST-NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION. DESPITE THE AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN...NHC
TRACK GUIDANCE IS RATHER DIVERGENT. WHILE MUCH OF THE GUIDANCE
AGREES ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION...THE GFDL...
GFDN...AND AVN MOVE THE HURRICANE NORTHWESTWARD. THE GFDL IS THE
EXTREME OUTLIER...MOVING THE SYSTEM NEAR CABO CORRIENTES AND THEN
INTO THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA. GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE TO THE
NORTH AND THE CURRENT TRENDS...THIS APPEARS UNLIKELY. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND IS IN BEST
AGREEMENT WITH THE UKMET AND NHC91.

CARLOTTA SHOWS GOOD OUTFLOW OVER THE SOUTH SEMICIRCLE...AND THAT
COMBINED WITH INCREASED CONVECTION FAVORS ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING.
THE SHIPS MODEL CALLS FOR 100 KT IN 24 HR. WHILE THAT IS POSSIBLE...
THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL BE A MORE CONSERVATIVE 90 KT. BY 36
HR...CARLOTTA WILL BE MOVING INTO COLDER WATER IN THE SAME GENERAL
AREA WHERE ALETTA AND BUD DIED. A STEADY WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN
AROUND THAT TIME.

THE INTENSITY OF CARLOTTA IS A MOVING TARGET THIS EVENING AS THE
HURRICANE HAS BEEN STRENGTHENING AT AN AMAZING RATE.  THE
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT FIRST ENTERED THE HURRICANE AT 19Z...AND
FOUND A 977 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE WITH ABOUT 80 KT OF SURFACE WIND. 
OVER THE NEXT THREE HOURS...THE CENTRAL PRESSURE FELL TO 970 MB AND
THE SURFACE WINDS INCREASED TO AT LEAST 95 KT.  INTERESTINGLY...
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST RECON FIX
WERE ABOUT 20 KT TOO HIGH.  SINCE THAT TIME...THE SATELLITE
ESTIMATES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE.  AT 00Z...THE DVORAK
CLASSIFICATIONS WERE A CONSENSUS 115 KT.  HOWEVER...THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN OBJECTIVE TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN GIVING AN ESTIMATE OF
ABOUT 135 KT FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS.  

THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN SET AT 115 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.
THIS MAKES CARLOTTA A CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR/SIMPSON
SCALE.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL SUGGESTS THAT CARLOTTA
HAS SOME ADDITIONAL DEEPENING TO DO...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS SUIT.  AFTER 24 HOURS...THE CYCLONE WILL ENCOUNTER COOLER
WATERS AND SHOULD WEAKEN RAPIDLY LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

CARLOTTA HAS CONTINUED TO INTENSIFY...WITH A WELL-DEFINED COLD CDO
AROUND A 15-20 NM WIDE EYE. EXACTLY HOW STRONG IT IS REMAINS A
PROBLEM. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES...INCLUDING THE OBJECTIVE
TECHNIQUE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN...ARE ALL NEAR 140 KT.
HOWEVER...THESE ESTIMATES WERE STRONGER THAN WHAT THE HURRICANE
HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATED TUESDAY AFTERNOON. ASSUMING THIS IS STILL
THE CASE...THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 130 KT.

CARLOTTA HAS WOBBLED A LITTLE MORE WESTWARD OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS
AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 275/8. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN
EITHER THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN OR THE FORECAST GUIDANCE OVER THE PAST
24 HR. A STRONG MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER NORTHWEST MEXICO SHOULD
STEER CARLOTTA GENERALLY WEST-NORTHWESTWARD. NHC TRACK GUIDANCE
GENERALLY AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO...ALTHOUGH THE GFDL STILL CALLS
FOR AN UNLIKELY TRACK TOWARD BAJA CALIFORNIA. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE
UKMET...WHICH HAS DONE A GOOD JOB ON CARLOTTA SO FAR.

DURING THE LAST HR OR SO...THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT WARMING OF THE
CLOUD TOPS...COOLING OF THE EYE...AND DECREASE IN THE OBJECTIVE T-
NUMBERS FROM 7.2 TO 6.8. THIS SUGGESTS THAT CARLOTTA MAY BE PEAKING.
U.S. NAVY SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANALYSES INDICATE THE WEST EDGE OF
28C OR WARMER WATER IS NEAR 105W...AND CARLOTTA MAY BE FEELING THE
NEARBY COLDER WATER. THE UPPER LEVEL ENVIRONMENT REMAINS VERY
FAVORABLE. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IN
THE FIRST 12 HR...IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THE WINDS CATCHING UP
WITH THE SATELLITE SIGNATURE. AFTER THAT...PROGRESSIVELY COLDER
WATER SHOULD CAUSE STEADY WEAKENING.

ALTHOUGH THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED A TIGHT WIND FIELD WITH SMALL 34 KT
WIND RADII...TWO SHIPS 250 NM EAST-NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER ARE
REPORTING 30 KT WINDS...AND SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES OUTER BANDS
FORMING IN THE NORTHEAST SEMICIRCLE. THUS THERE IS A CHANCE THE WIND
FIELD IS SPREADING OUT. HOPEFULLY A QUIKSCAT OVERPASS NEAR 13Z WILL

ALTHOUGH OBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN
CONTINUE AROUND 7.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...THE SUBJECTIVE NUMBERS
FROM TAFB...SAB AND GLOBAL ARE BEGINNING TO DECREASE.  THE EYE IS
STILL SHARP ON VISIBLE IMAGES BUT THE SURROUNDING RING OF
CONVECTION...WHITE ON THE BD CURVE...IS GRADUALLY SHRINKING.
CARLOTTA CONTINUES AS A STRONG CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE ON THE
SAFFIR/SIMPSON HURRICANE SCALE WITH MAXIMUM WINDS OF 130 KNOTS BUT
SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS
OR SO.  THEREAFTER...COOLER WATER AHEAD OF THE STORM IS THE ONLY
APPARENT INHIBITING FACTOR...ACCORDING TO THE SHIPS MODEL.  OTHER
FACTORS FOR INTENSITY FLUCTUATIONS SUCH AS INNER CORE STRUCTURE
CHANGES...ARE NOT EASY TO EVALUATE AND MUCH LESS TO FORECAST.
 
THE MOTION HAS BEEN BASICALLY 280/08...LIKE MOST OF THE EASTERN
PACIFIC TROPICAL CYCLONES.  THIS GENERAL TRACK SHOULD CONTINUE
AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A PERSISTENT STRONG WARM HIGH OVER MEXICO.
ONCE AGAIN...THE UK MODEL HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS BASICALLY ON TOP OF IT.  THE GFDL CONTINUES TO BE THE
OUTLIER...TURNING CARLOTTA NORTHWARD TOWARD BAJA CALIFORNIA.
 
BANDS OF HEAVY RAINS FROM THE PERIPHERY OF CARLOTTA AND HIGH WAVES
ARE STILL AFFECTING A LARGE PORTION OF THE SOUTHWEST MEXICAN COAST.
THESE CONDITIONS WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.

SURROUNDING RING OF CONVECTION IS WARMING AND ERODING. CONSEQUENTLY
ALL T-NUMBERS ARE DECREASING AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN
LOWERED TO 125 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  ALTHOUGH SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY ARE LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO...THE OFFICIAL

COOLER WATERS. THIS IS SUGGESTED BY ALL AVAILABLE INTENSITY
GUIDANCE.

CARLOTTA HAS BEEN MOVING BETWEEN WEST AND WEST-NORTHWEST...AROUND
THE PERIPHERY OF A WARM HIGH OVER MEXICO WHICH IS FORECAST TO
PERSIST BY MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS.  THIS GENERAL TRACK IS
INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.   ONCE AGAIN...THE GFDL 
1200Z RUN SHARPLY TURNS CARLOTTA NORTHWARD TOWARD BAJA CALIFORNIA
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THE GFDN...WHICH RUNS OFF THE NOGAPS

THE EYE IS BECOMING A LITTLE HARDER TO FOLLOW...AND THE SYSTEM IS
FIGHTING SOME NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
HAD FALLEN TO 115 KT AT 00Z...AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT
110 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  ALTHOUGH THE SHEAR MAY LESSEN A BIT OVER

THE FORWARD MOTION HAS SLOWED A BIT AND IS NOW 290/7.  THE UKMET
HINTS AT A SLIGHT WEAKENING IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF CARLOTTA...ALTHOUGH THE RIDGE IS FORECAST TO RE-STRENGTHEN

GUIDANCE SHOWS A WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWESTWARD MOTION THROUGH 72
HOURS WITH SOME ACCELERATION OF FORWARD SPEED AROUND THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF A RIDGE OVER MEXICO.  THE GFDN AND UKMET HAVE SHIFTED

DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES WEAKEN THE HURRICANE TO 100 KNOTS BY 06Z
AND THE SHIFOR MODEL DROPS THE WIND SPEED TO 37 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS AS
THE FORECAST TRACK MOVES OVER COLDER WATER.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
BASICALLY FOLLOWS THE SHIFOR MODEL.

CONVECTION. IN FACT...THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN LOOKS BETTER THAN 6
HOURS AGO. BECAUSE THE T-NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THIS

THE HURRICANE IS MOVING TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST ABOUT 7 KNOTS
AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A MID TO UPPER-LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM
OVER MEXICO.  MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS FORECAST THAT THE STRUCTURE

...CARLOTTA SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE SAME TRACK THROUGHOUT THE
FORECAST PERIOD.  ONLY THE GFDL AND THE GFDN SHOW A TRACK MORE TO

GUIDANCE MODELS TO MOVE THE HURRICANE ON A NORTHWEST TO NORTH-
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  THE NOGAPS MODEL IS
THE FARTHEST TO THE RIGHT OF THE MODELS BRINGING THE CENTER ACROSS
CENTRAL BAJA CALIFORNIA AFTER 48 HOURS.  THE UKMET REMAINS WELL
OFFSHORE ON A NORTHWESTWARD TRACK AND DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM AFTER 48
HOURS.  THE GFDL DISSIPATES BY 48 HOURS AND IS BETWEEN THE NOGAPS

SLIGHTLY RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  EVEN THOUGH THE HURRICANE
IS FORECAST TO REMAIN SOME 175 N MI OFFSHORE..THE GOVERNMENT OF
MEXICO HAS DECIDED TO ISSUE A TROPICAL STORM WATCH FOR THE SOUTHERN
PORTION OF BAJA CALIFORNIA.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN INTENSITY SO
FAR...AS THERE IS STILL A SMALL COLD CDO WITH A POSSIBLE HINT OF AN

MID/UPPER LEVEL LOW NEAR OR JUST WEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. LARGE-
SCALE GUIDANCE MODELS FORECAST THIS FEATURE TO PERSIST...AND IF
CARLOTTA WERE OVER WARM WATER IT WOULD LIKELY RECURVE ON THE EAST
SIDE OF THE LOW. SINCE THE WATER TEMPERATURES AHEAD OF THE HURRICANE
ARE LESS THAN 20C...THE RESULT IS LIKELY TO BE DEATH BEFORE
RECURVATURE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A GENERAL NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION UNTIL DISSIPATION.

WHILE THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS REMAIN FAVORABLE...THE COLD WATER ALONG
THE FORECAST TRACK SHOULD CAUSE CARLOTTA TO DISSIPATE. THE INTENSITY

LOCATED BENEATH A SMALL ANTICYCLONE BASED ON WATER VAPOR AND IR
SATELLITE IMAGERY AND OUTFLOW IS GOOD TO THE SOUTH. 0151Z AND 0159Z
MICROWAVE WINDS SUPPORT A 20 TO 25 KT DEPRESSION AND NIGHT TIME
VISIBLE IMAGERY INDICATE A TIGHT LOW-LEVEL SWIRL STILL REMAINS...
ALBEIT VERY SMALL.

INITIAL MOTION IS 275/10. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMPLY AN
UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. TD FOUR-E REMAINS EMBEDDED WITHIN A
DEEP EASTERLY STEERING FLOW ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE LARGE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO NORTH WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE SYSTEM ON A GENERAL
WESTERLY COURSE. THE FORECAST TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE UKMET AND CLIPER
MODEL FORECASTS.

I AM HOLDING ON TO THE SYSTEM MAINLY DUE TO THE CONVECTIVE
FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE PREVIOUS 2 DAYS WITH
INCREASING CONVECTION AT NIGHT AND DECREASING CONVECTION DURING THE
DAY. HOWEVER...UNLESS DEEP CONVECTION RE-DEVELOPS NEAR THE SYSTEM
CENTER WITHIN THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS...TD FOUR-E WILL RAPIDLY WEAKEN

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE 35

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/16. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN EITHER
FORECAST REASONING OR THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE FROM THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE. A BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA WEST OF DANIEL SHOULD GRADUALLY
FILL AND BE REPLACED BY A RIDGE.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW THE STORM TO
FOLLOW A WEST TO JUST NORTH OF WEST MOTION THROUGH THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS A LITTLE TRICKY.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS
FORECAST A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.  THE BIG PROBLEM IS EXACTLY WHERE
THE STORM TRACKS IN RELATION TO COOLER WATER.  A LITTLE MORE
NORTHWARD TRACK...AS SHOWN BY LBAR...WOULD LIMIT INTENSIFICATION
AFTER 48 HR AS SHOWN BY SHIPS.  A MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK...AS SHOWN BY
BAMD AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...WOULD ALLOW MORE TIME OVER WARMER
WATER AND MORE STRENGTHENING.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR
STEADY INTENSIFICATION THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS IS A
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE POSSIBILITIES FROM THE VARIOUS FORECAST
TRACKS.  IT IS NOTABLE THAT DANIEL IS A RELATIVELY SMALL SYSTEM...

1004.8 MB AND 26 KT...SUGGESTING THAT THE CENTRAL PRESSURE COULD BE
BELOW 1000 MB.  THEREFORE THE 03Z WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 50

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT MON JUL 24 2000
 
DANIEL CONTINUES TO BECOME ORGANIZED AND HAS NOW REACHED HURRICANE
INTENSITY BASED ON AN EYE FEATURE IN 0835Z TRMM IMAGERY AND A
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 65 KT FROM SAB. A SMALL CDO APPEARS
TO HAVE DEVELOPED DURING THE PAST 2 HOURS WITH A COLD OVERSHOOTING
TOP OF -80C NEAR THE CENTER. OUTFLOW IS GOOD AND IMPROVING IN ALL
QUADRANTS WHILE THE OVERALL CONVECTIVE PATTERN HAS BECOME MORE
CIRCULAR AND SYMMETRIC. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/15. THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OF THE FORECAST
MODELS IS WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 24 WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO
THE WEST AFTERWARDS. THE UKMET AND GFDL MODELS HAVE BEEN PERFORMING
WELL AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY CLOSE TO THOSE MODELS
AND MORE TO THE RIGHT OF OUR PREVIOUS FORECASTS. THE STRONG
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF DANIEL WILL LIKELY PREVENT ANY
POLEWARD MOTION NORTH OF 15N LATITUDE.
 
DANIEL APPEARS TO RAPIDLY INTENSIFYING AND WE HAVE FOLLOWED THAT
TREND FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS WHICH WOULD BRING THE HURRICANE TO
CATEGORY 3 INTENSITY BY TOMORROW. THE SHIPS MODEL ONLY BRINGS DANIEL
TO 90 KT IN 36 HOURS AND THEN LEVELS IT OFF AT 95 KT AFTERWARDS.
HOWEVER...THE LATEST NAVY OCEANOGRAPHIC CENTER SST ANALYSIS
INDICATES THE 28C ISOTHERM EXTENDS FURTHER WEST...TO 120W...THAN THE
NCEP SST ANALYSIS USED IN THE SHIPS MODELS.

HURRICANE DANIEL DISCUSSION NUMBER   6
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 PM PDT MON JUL 24 2000
 
HURRICANE DANIEL HAS DISPLAYED MINOR FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CONVECTIVE
PATTERN DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS...BUT OVERALL APPEARANCE HAS
CONTINUED TO IMPROVE. AN EYE HAS DEVELOPED IN BOTH VISIBLE AND
INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 70
TO 75 KT FROM TAFB...AFWA AND SAB. OUTFLOW REMAINS GOOD TO EXCELLENT
IN ALL QUADRANTS WHILE BANDING FEATURES HAVE BECOME MORE DISTINCT.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 285/18. SOME ACCELERATION AND A SLIGHT POLEWARD
JOG HAS OCCURRED DUE TO POSSIBLE BINARY INTERACTION WITH A MID-
LEVEL CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH A COLD MCS THAT DEVELOPED JUST
WEST OF DANIEL. HOWEVER...RECENT SATELLITE TRENDS INDICATE THE MCS
IS WEAKENING AND BEGINNING TO SHEAR OUT INTO AN OUTER CONVECTIVE
BAND. AS A RESULT...WE ANTICIPATE A GENERAL RETURN FROM A 295
DEGREES JOG BACK TO A 285 DEGREE MOTION AND A DECREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED. NO CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED MODEL CONSENSUS OF A
GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 36 HOURS AND BECOMING MORE
WESTWARD AFTERWARDS BASED ON THE STRONG RIDGING TO THE NORTH OF
DANIEL.
 
DANIEL CONTINUES ITS RAPID INTENSIFICATION PHASE AND WE EXPECT THAT
TREND TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER 18 TO 24 HOURS...WHICH WOULD BRING THE
HURRICANE TO CATEGORY 3 INTENSITY SOMETIME TOMORROW. THE SHIPS MODEL
ONLY BRINGS DANIEL TO 90 KT IN 24 HOURS AND MAINTAINS THAT INTENSITY
THROUGH THE PERIOD. SHIPS LOWER INTENSITY FORECAST IS MAINLY DUE TO
DANIEL TRACKING OVER MUCH COOLER SSTS...25C TO 26C...AFTER 24 HOURS.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INTENSITY IS MAINTAINED HIGHER THAN THE SHIPS
MODEL BASED ON MUCH WARMER SSTS INDICATED IN YESTERDAYS NAVO SST
ANALYSIS AND ALSO NEARBY SHIP REPORTS...28C TO 28.5C SSTS...JUST
NORTH AND WEST OF HURRICANE DANIEL. AFTER 36 HOURS...A GENERAL SLOW
WEAKENING TREND IS FORECAST BASED ON DANIEL MOVING OVER 26C TO 27C
SSTS WEST OF 122W LONGITUDE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/19 AND THE FORWARD SPEED WAS
ACTUALLY 20 KT FOR THE PAST 6 HOURS.  EXCEPT FOR THE GFDL...ALL OF
THE GUIDANCE SHOW A MOSTLY WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS WITH
SOME DECELERATION.  THE GFDL BECOMES VERY SLOW NORTHWESTWARD AT 72

OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THE CONSENSUS OF THE GUIDANCE AND IS
ALMOST THE SAME TRACK AS THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY EXCEPT JUST A LITTLE
FASTER.

DANIEL CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN WITH A SMALL EYE PRESENT AND BANDING

STRENGTHENING FOR ANOTHER 12 HOURS FOLLOWED BY WEAKENING AFTER 36

HURRICANE DANIEL DISCUSSION NUMBER   8
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT TUE JUL 25 2000

DANIEL IS EXHIBITING A CLASSIC APPEARANCE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...
WITH AN EYE ESTIMATED NEAR 15 N MI IN DIAMETER EMBEDDED IN THE COLD
CLOUD TOPS.  CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE VIA THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE IS
100 KNOTS...BASED ON A CONSENSUS T NUMBER OF 5.5 FROM TAFB AND SAB.
THE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW IS STRONG AND THE ONLY APPARENT
INHIBITING FACTOR FOR STRENGTHENING IS THE SST ALONG THE PROJECTED
TRACK.  THE LATEST SHIPS MODEL RUN SUGGESTS FURTHER INTENSIFICATION
AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INDICATES A LITTLE MORE STRENGTHENING AS
WELL.  HOWEVER...LATER IN THE PERIOD...DANIEL IS LIKELY TO GRADUAL
WEAKEN DUE TO SLIGHTLY COOLER WATER TEMPERATURES.

A STRONG MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE IS
PROVIDING A SWIFT STEERING CURRENT.  INITIAL MOTION IS NEAR
285/18...FASTER THAN THE CLIMATOLOGICAL AVERAGE.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SHOWS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE 15 TO 20 DEGREES TO THE
WEST OF DANIEL.  THIS FEATURE COULD INDUCE A MORE NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION...BUT IT APPEARS TO BE MOVING WESTWARD WITH THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE.  GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS SHOW THE MID/UPPER CYCLONE MOVING
WESTWARD AND WEAKENING.  THEREFORE NO SIGNIFICANT TURN TO THE RIGHT
IS EXPECTED...BUT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DOES SHOW A SLOWING OF THE
FORWARD SPEED DURING THE PERIOD AS THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF DANIEL
IS LIKELY TO WEAKEN WITH TIME.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE TRACK
PRODUCED BY THE U.K. MET. OFFICE MODEL...AND ONLY A SMIDGEON TO THE
NORTH OF THE TRACK FROM THE PREVIOUS NHC ADVISORY.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT TUE JUL 25 2000
 
THE 15 NM WIDE EYE OF DANIEL HAS BECOME BETTER DEFINED OVER THE PAST
FEW HOURS...AND OBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS HAVE BEEN AS HIGH AS T5.9
(ALMOST 115 KT).  SUBJECTIVE SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 115
KT...102 KT...AND 102 KT FROM AFWA...TAFB...AND SAB RESPECTIVELY.
THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE THUS INCREASED TO 105 KT IN THIS ADVISORY.

THE HURRICANE HAS MOVED A LITTLE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...AND
THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 280/17.  THE TRACK FORECAST IS STRAIGHT
FORWARD.  A STRONG DEEP LAYER RIDGE NORTH OF DANIEL SHOULD KEEP THE
HURRICANE ON A WEST TO JUST NORTH OF WEST TRACK THROUGH 72 HR. 
LARGE-SCALE MODELS SUGGEST THE RIDGE MAY WEAKEN A LITTLE NEAR THE
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...ALLOWING SOME DECELERATION AND A LITTLE
MORE NORTHWARD MOTION.  NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST AGREE WITH THIS SCENARIO...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE GFDL
WHICH DRASTICALLY SLOWS THE HURRICANE AND TURNS IT NORTH INTO THE
RIDGE. 

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS MORE COMPLEX.  DANIEL CURRENTLY SHOWS GOOD
OUTFLOW EVERYWHERE EXCEPT EASTWARD.  WHILE AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IS
WEST OF THE HURRICANE...LARGE-SCALE MODELS ARE UNANIMOUS THAT THE
LOW WILL WEAKEN AND BE REPLACED BY AN EAST-WEST RIDGE ALONG 15N. 
THIS WOULD ALLOW DANIEL TO MAINTAIN ITSELF.  THE PROBLEM IS THE SEA
SURFACE TEMPERATURES.  THE SST ANALYSIS FROM THE NAVY INDICATES THE
HURRICANE IS APPROACHING THE END OF THE 28C WATER. ON THE OTHER
HAND...FOR NO OBVIOUS REASON THE SSTS USED IN THE SHIPS MODEL ARE 2C
WARMER THAN THEY WERE YESTERDAY.  THIS ALLOWS THE MODEL TO KEEP THE
WINDS AT 105-115 KT THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE INTENSITY
FORECAST WILL COMPROMISE...CALLING FOR INTENSIFICATION OVER THE NEXT
12 HR FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL WEAKENING AS DANIEL MOVES ALONG THE
SOUTH EDGE OF COOLER WATER.  SHOULD DANIEL TURN MORE NORTHWARD...IT
WOULD WEAKEN FASTER THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.

DANIEL IS MOVING 280/15 AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A WELL ESTABLISHED

SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRENGTH OR IN THE POSITION OF THE

THERE IS NO CHANGE TO EITHER THE REASONING BEHIND THE PREVIOUS
INTENSITY FORECAST OR THE FORECAST ITSELF.  DANIEL CONTINUES MOVING
ALMOST PARALLEL TO THE 26C ISOTHERM IN A LOW SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.
THIS SHOULD ALLOW ONLY A SLOW WEAKENING THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS. DANIEL CONTINUES TO HAVE A
SMALL BUT DISTINCT EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A WELL DEFINED CENTRAL DENSE
OVERCAST.  HOWEVER...THE RING OF CONVECTION SURROUNDING THE EYE IS
WARMER THAN EARLIER TODAY. INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO
100 KNOTS. WHILE THE SHEAR IS LOW...THE OCEAN IS COOLER.  THEREFORE
A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS ANTICIPATED. 

THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE CONTROLLING THE MOTION OF THE HURRICANE IS
FORECAST TO PERSIST AND PERHAPS STRENGTHEN BEYOND 48 HOURS. THIS
PATTERN WILL KEEP DANIEL ON A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK.
THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

LATEST INFRARED IMAGES SHOW THE EYE BECOMING LESS WELL-DEFINED AND
THIS IS CONFIRMED IN A RECENT SSM/I IMAGE.  CENTRAL COLD CONVECTION
IS SLOWLY DIMINISHING...AS ARE DVORAK T-NUMBERS.  CURRENT INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS 95 KNOTS.  UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS ANALYSES
SUGGEST SOME INCREASE IN SHEAR AHEAD OF DANIEL DUE TO A HIGH-LEVEL
TROUGH NEAR 140W...BUT GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS SUGGEST THAT THIS
TROUGH WILL SHIFT WEST AND WEAKEN.  ONLY SLOW WEAKENING OF DANIEL IS
FORECAST...AND THE SYSTEM IS MAINTAINED AS A HURRICANE THROUGH 72
HOURS. 

MOTION CONTINUES STEADILY WESTWARD NEAR 15 KNOTS.  A WELL-
ESTABLISHED MID-LEVEL RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN NORTH OF THE
HURRICANE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THEREFORE A WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK IS FORECAST...AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORIES.

A LARGE EYE HAS BECOME EVIDENT ONCE AGAIN IN INFRARED SATELLITE
IMAGERY. SATELLITE CURRENT T-NUMBERS FROM TAFB...SAB...AND KGWC
RANGE FROM 85 TO 90 KT WHICH SUPPORTS THE OFFICAL INTENSITY OF 
90 KT. AN EXPANDING EYE PATTERN FURTHER SUPPORTS A SLIGHT WEAKENING
TREND. DANIEL REMAINS A COMPACT HURRICANE WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED
UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW.
 
EVEN THOUGH THE PAST 6 HOUR MOTION SUGGESTS A DUE WEST JOG IN THE
TRACK...THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/15 BASED ON THE PAST 12 HOURS
TREND. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS SHOWS A FLAT SHARP
POLEWARD EDGE TO THE OUTFLOW CIRRUS.  THIS SUGGESTS UPPER LEVEL
CONFLUENCE IS OCCURRING ALONG 20N LATITUDE BETWEEN THE POLEWARD
OUTFLOW AND A 200 MB ANTICYCLONE NEAR 24N135W...AS SEEN IN THE
UW-CIMMS WATER VAPOR WIND ANALYSES. THE ASSOCIATED SUBSIDENCE IS
LIKELY KEEPING THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF DANIEL STRONGER THAN THE
UKMET MODEL IS INDICATING. THE PAST 24 HOURS OF UKMET AND GFDN MODEL
RUNS HAVE HAD A CONSISTENT 10 DEGREES RIGHT OF TRACK BIAS...WHEREAS
THE GFDL AND NOGAPS HAVE HAD A BETTER HANDLE ON THE GENERAL
DIRECTION...ALBEIT TOO SLOW.  THE OFFICAL FORECAST UPDATES THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK THROUGH 36 HOURS WITH A LITTLE MORE WESTWARD
MOTION AFTERWARDS...AND THE FASTER SPEED OF THE UKMET MODEL WAS
FOLLOWED.
 
ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CONVECTIVE PATTERN
OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS AS DANIEL TRACKS ALONG THE 25.5C TO 26C SST
ISOTHERM...THE GENERAL TREND SHOULD BE FOR GRADUAL WEAKENING. WE
HAVE FOLLOWED THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL CLOSELY...WHICH TAKES DANIEL
DOWN TO MINIMUM HURRICANE INTENSITY IN 72 HOURS.

THE EYE HAS BECOME MORE DISTINCT AND INNER CORE CONVECTIVE TOPS HAVE
COOLED SUGGESTING THAT DANIEL HAS RE-INTENSIFIED. THE OFFICAL
INTENSITY OF 95 KT IS BASED ON SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF
5.0...90 KT...FROM SAB AND KGWC AND 5.5...100 KT...FROM TAFB. DANIEL
IS NOT BEING TAKEN BACK UP TO CATEGORY THREE INTENSITY
DUE TO THE EYE BEING OVER COOLER THAN NORMAL SSTS FOR A MAJOR
HURRICANE...WHICH SHOULD MAKE THE BOUNDARY LAYER MORE STABLE AND
KEEP THE STRONGEST WINDS FROM REACHING THE SURFACE. THE OUTFLOW
PATTERN REMAINS IMPRESSIVE AND THE OVERALL CONVECTIVE PATTERN IS
SYMMETRICAL. 

THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO OUR PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR
REASONING. INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 275/15 BASED ON THE PAST 12 HOURS
TREND. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW THE FLATTENED POLEWARD
OUTFLOW TO THE NORTH OF DANIEL AND THE SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES HAVE
BEEN SHIFTING WESTWARD IN TANDEM WITH DANIEL. THE GLOBAL MODELS
CONTINUE THAT TREND THROUGH THE PERIOD AND THE LATEST UKMET RUN IS
FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE PREVIOUS RUNS WITH A MORE WESTWARD TRACK
INDICATED AFTER 48 HOURS. THERE IS ALSO MORE CONVERGENCE IN THE
FORECAST MODELS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS FOUR RUNS AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE MODEL SUITE...WHILE
MAINTAINING A STEADY 15 KT SPEED THROUGH THE PERIOD. THIS MEANS THAT
DANIEL COULD POSE A THREAT TO THE BIG ISLAND OF HAWAII SOMETIME ON
MONDAY.

A 1430Z QUIKSCAT OVERPASS INDICATES THAT MOST OF THE INFLOW IS FROM
THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST WITH MOST OF THE COOLER MORE STABLE AIR TO
THE NORTH BEING SHUNTED AROUND THE WEST SIDE OF DANIEL. THIS INFLOW
PATTERN IS FORECAST BY THE GLOBAL MODELS TO PERSIST THROUGH 48 HOURS
AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DECAYS DANIEL MORE SLOWLY THAN THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY...WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE SHIPS MODEL.

DESPITE THE RELATIVE COOLER WATER...ASSUMING A CORRECT SST ANALYSIS
...DANIEL HAS NOT WEAKENED AND CONTINUES TO BE A VERY WELL ORGANIZED
HURRICANE WITH A TYPICAL ROUND CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST AND A DISTINCT
EYE.  IN FACT...IT MAY BE A LITTLE STRONGER AT THIS TIME. SUBJECTIVE
T-NUMBERS ARE 5.5 WHILE OBJECTIVE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN PEAKING AT 6.0
ON THE DVORAK SCALE.  INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE KEPT AT 95 KNOTS BUT
WINDS MAY BE 100 KNOTS.  A GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN DUE TO THE
INFLUENCE OF COOLER WATERS.  HOWEVER...THE SST ARE NOT CHANGING MUCH
AHEAD OF DANIEL...REMAINING ABOUT 25-26 DEGREES.  I WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED IF THE WEAKENING PROCESS IS SLOWER THAN ANTICIPATED.
  
DANIEL IS MOVING WESTWARD ABOUT 15 KNOTS AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE ANCHORED TO THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE.  THIS HIGH
IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE.  THEREFORE...THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE ON THE SAME TRACK AND A WEAKER DANIEL SHOULD BE APPROACHING
THE BIG ISLAND IN ABOUT 72 HOURS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF
THE TRACK MODELS WHICH INDEED ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT.

RESIDENTS IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF

ALTHOUGH OVER ROUGHLY 25C WATER...DANIEL HAS SHOWN AN IMPROVED
SATELLITE SIGNATURE DURING THE NIGHT WITH COLDER CLOUD TOPS IN THE

ARE 115 KT...102 KT...AND 102 KT.  ADDITIONALLY...OBJECTIVE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN AS HIGH AS 115 KT.  THE MAXIMUM WINDS
ARE INCREASED TO 105 KT IN THIS ADVISORY.

THE EYE HAS WOBBLED SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE PAST 6 HR...AND
SMOOTHING OUT THE WOBBLES GIVES AN INITIAL MOTION OF 280/16.  WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A STRONG DEEP LAYER RIDGE NORTH OF THE
HURRICANE...AND THIS SHOULD CONTINUE DANIEL ON A GENERAL WEST TO
WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 48 HR.  AFTER THAT...THE RIDGE SOMEWHAT
WEAKENS AS A STRONG TROUGH NORTH OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS DIGS
SOUTHWARD.  THIS MAY ALLOW A MORE NORTHWARD MOTION.  TRACK FORECAST
GUIDANCE SHOWS A FAIRLY LARGE SPREAD...WITH THE GFDN AND UKMET
TAKING DANIEL WELL NORTHEAST OF HAWAII WHILE NOGAPS AND BAMS TAKE IT
TOWARD THE ISLANDS.  ALL MODELS SUGGEST A SLOWER MOTION AFTER 48 HR. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONTINUES DANIEL ON A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK THROUGH 72 HR WITH A GRADUAL DECELERATION...ALTHOUGH NOT AS
MUCH AS INDICATED BY THE GUIDANCE.  THIS TRACK IS IN BEST AGREEMENT
WITH THE GFDL AND NHC91.

WHILE DANIEL HAS INTENSIFIED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...AN ELONGATION
OF THE CLOUD PATTERN...CIRRUS FROM THE ITCZ MOVING TOWARD THE
STORM...AND A NEARBY LARGE FIELD OF STRATOCUMULUS SUGGESTS THIS
TREND IS TEMPORARY.  A SLOW WEAKENING IS LIKELY OVER THE NEXT 24-48
HR.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS SUGGEST THAT UPPER LEVEL WESTERLIES MAY BE
PRESENT W OF 150W BY 48-72 HR.  SHOULD THIS OCCUR...DANIEL COULD
WEAKEN FASTER DURING THAT TIME THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.
 
RESIDENTS IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF

QUADRANTS AND THE SOUTHERLY SHEAR ON THE SYSTEM APPEARS TO HAVE
RELAXED OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS.

NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK. THE INITIAL

SOME LATITUDE OWING TO SOME WEAK SOUTHERLY SHEAR AND A MID TO UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH PASSING TO THE NORTH WHICH ACTED TO WEAKEN THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THE

SOME DEEP CONVECTION...THUNDERSTORMS...HAVE REDEVELOPED AROUND THE
CIRCULATION CENTER IN THE PAST 6 HOURS. THE LATEST DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE 3.5 AND 4.0 FROM SAB AND HONOLULU AND THEREFORE DANIEL
HAS BEEN KEPT AT 65 KT. THE LATEST SCATTEROMETER DATA DID NOT
CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF A CLOSED CIRCULATION. THE FIRST AIRCRAFT
RECONAISSANCE SCHEDULED FOR 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON WILL PROBABLY
PROVIDE ANSWERS ABOUT BOTH THE CIRCULATION AND ITS STRENGTH. THE 
FORECAST TREND IS FOR CONTINUED WEAKENING IN AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIP
MODEL AS DANIEL MOVES TOWARDS THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. THE TRACK
REMAINS SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WEST ACROSS THE ISLANDS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT
WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE GFDL MODEL.

THE FIRST AIRCRAFT RECON ON DANIEL FOUND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 995
MB AND ESTIMATED MAX SURFACE WINDS AT 55 KT. DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES RANGE FROM 55 TO 65 KT. DANIEL IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO A
TROPICAL STORM ON THE 5 PM ADVISORY. THE DEEP CONVECTION AROUND THE
CENTER CONTINUES TO FLUCTUATE AND IS NOW MOSTLY LIMITED TO THE NORTH
QUADRANT. THE FORECAST IS FOR CONTINUED WEAKENING AS DANIEL MOVES
WEST TOWARDS THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS AND ENCOUNTERS INCREASING UPPER
SHEAR.  

DANIEL HAS TAKEN A MORE WEST NORTHWEST MOTION DURING THE PAST 6
HOURS BUT SHOULD RETURN TO A MORE WEST TRACK AFTER 24 HOURS AS THE
SYSTEM BECOMES MORE SHALLOW AND IS LESS AFFECTED BY UPPER WINDS. THE
TRACK IS INITIALLY BASED ON PERSISTENCE BUT LATER IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN THE GFDL AND BAM SHALLOW.

RESIDENTS IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF DANIEL. DANIEL COULD PRODUCE HEAVY RAINFALL

THE 06Z POSITION AGREES WITH BOTH THE HONOLULU AND SAB SATELLITE
FIXES AND WITH THE LATEST AIRCRAFT RECON FIX. DANIEL HAS BEEN ON A
WEST NORTHWEST TRACK THE LAST 12 HOURS PROBABLY BECAUSE OF A
WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH. DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES RANGED FROM 45 TO 55 KNOTS FROM SAB AND HONOLULU
RESPECTIVELY. A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 997 MB ESTIMATED BY THE RECON
FLIGHT ALSO INDICATES 55 KNOT MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS. DEEP
CONVECTION CONTINUES TO BE LIMITED TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH
QUADRANTS CLOSE TO THE CENTER.

DANIEL IS KEPT ON A WEST NORTHWEST TRACK OVER THE NEXT 12 HOURS WITH
ADDITIONAL WEAKENING EXPECTED. THE FORECAST THEN CALLS FOR DANIEL TO
TURN TO THE WEST AS THE WEAKER SYSTEM IS INCREASINGLY STEERED BY THE
TRADE WINDS. THE FORECAST MOVEMENT FROM 48 HOURS ONWARD SHOWS SOME
ACCELERATION AS DANIEL MOVES SOUTH OF A BUILDING SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.
THE TRACK IS CLOSEST TO THE NWS AND NAVY NOGAP AIDES AND IS SIMILAR
TO THE LAST FORECAST TRACK.

...A TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR KAUAI...
 
SATELLITE FIXES AND RECONNAISSANCE SHOW THAT DANIEL HAS STRENGTHENED
SLIGHTLY THIS AFTERNOON AND TAKEN A JOG TO THE RIGHT. THE MORE
NORTHWESTWARD COURSE IS LIKELY DUE TO THE REDEVELOPMENT OF DEEP
CONVECTION MAINLY TO THE NORTH OF THE CENTER...PULLING THE STORM
NORTHWARD AND ALLOWING A GREATER INFLUENCE FROM UPPER LEVEL WINDS
WITH A SOUTHERLY COMPONENT. RECONNAISSANCE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE
EYE HAD REFORMED AND SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS DEEP CONVECTION NOW
COVERING THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER ONCE AGAIN. 

THIS STRENGTHENING MAY ONLY BE TEMPORARY...BUT THE NORTHWARD JOG OF
THE SYSTEM WILL NOW RESULT IN A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK...TAKING THE
STORM JUST NORTH OF ALL THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. AS SHOULD ALWAYS BE
BORN IN MIND WITH TROPICAL SYSTEMS...FORECAST TRACKS ARE ALWAYS
SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS SUBTLE INFLUENCES CHANGE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE STORM. THUS MAUI...MOLOKAI...LANAI AND OAHU REMAIN UNDER A
TROPICAL STORM WARNING AND KAUAI REMAINS UNDER A TROPICAL STORM
WATCH. THE BIG ISLAND OF HAWAII HAS BEEN CLEARED OF ALL WATCHES AND
WARNINGS AS DANIEL IS NOW ON A TRACK THAT WILL TAKE IT TOO FAR TO
THE NORTH OF THIS ISLAND. THIS MODIFIED TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE
ENSEMBLE FORECAST TRACK OF SEVERAL MODELS AND IS NOW NORTH OF THE
PREVIOUSLY FOLLOWED GFDL-AVIATION MODEL TRACK.

AS PREVIOUSLY FORECAST...DANIEL IS EXPECTED TO LOSE STRENGTH
GRADUALLY PASSING NORTH OF THE ISLANDS. ONCE IT IS WEST OF KAUAI...
DANIEL WILL LIKELY BEGIN TO STRENGTHEN DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE
WARMER SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES IN THAT AREA.

COLLAPSING AND THE POSSIBLE EYE CLOSED UP. TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH
IS MAINTAINED THROUGH EARLY TONIGHT...FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL
WEAKENING OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

THE DEEPER CIRCULATION WILL APPARANTLY TAKE DANIEL ON A MORE
NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...BETWEEN THE BETA ADVECTION MODEL SHALLOW AND

...DANIEL CONTINUING TO WEAKEN NORTHEAST OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS...

THE EXPOSED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER OF DANIEL IS ABOUT 130 SM
NORTHEAST OF HONOLULU. THE NEAREST DEEP CONVECTION IS 100 MILES TO
THE NORTH OF THIS CENTER. THE CURRENT INTENSITY FORECAST IS IN CLOSE
AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS FORECAST IN SLOWLY WEAKENING THE MAX WINDS
FROM THE CURRENT 45 MPH ESTIMATE...BASED ON THE LATEST DVORAK
T2.5/3.0 FROM THE HONOLULU SATELLITE UNIT. THE MODEL TRACKS ARE
FAIRLY TIGHTLY GROUPED TOWARDS THE NORTHWEST WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
THE GFDL AND CLIPPER WHICH PREFER A MORE WEST NORTHWEST DIRECTION.
THE CUURENT FORECAST GRADUALLY CURVES THE TRACK MORE NORTHWEST
CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE BAM SHALLOW AND TAKING DANIEL AROUND THE
SOUTHWEST END OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO ITS NORTH.

TAKING ITS FUTURE PATH INTO COOLER AND LESS FAVORABLE WATERS.
CONVECTION MAY TEMPORARILY REFORM OVER THE CENTER AS IT HAS IN
PREVIOUS DAYS BUT GENERAL WEAKENING STILL THE DOMINANT TREND.
FORECAST PATH MOST FOLLOWS BAM SHALLOW AS FUTURE SHEARING INCREASES

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE CENTERED ABOUT 540 MILES SOUTH OF CABO SAN
LUCAS HAS ORGANIZED INTO TROPICAL DEPRESSION SEVEN-E. ALTHOUGH DEEP
CONVECTION HAS BECOME LESS CENTRALIZED DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS...THE
OVERALL CONVECTIVE PATTERN HAS IMPROVED AND SUPPORTS AT LEAST
TROPICAL DEPRESSION INTENSITY. A 0748Z TRMM OVERPASS INDICATED A
TIGHT MID-LEVEL CIRCULATION IN THE 85H CHANNEL LOCATED ABOUT 60NM
NORTH OF THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER AS SEEN IN THE 37H CHANNEL. SUBJECTIVE
FIXES FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB SUPPORT THE MORE SOUTHERLY POSITION.
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 2.0...30 KT...FROM TAFB AND SAB
SUPPORT STARTING THIS SYSTEM AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.

INITIAL MOTION IS 295/09. TD SEVEN-E IS EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN A
GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 36 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL TURN
MORE TOWARD THE WEST AFTERWARDS. THIS SCENARIO IS CLOSE TO THE
CLIPER AND BAMD MODELS. THE CURRENT SYNOPTIC PATTERN INDICATES A
STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE ALONG 30N LATITUDE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM
WHICH SHOULD ENHANCE THE DEEP EASTERLIES STEERING FLOW.

LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE A LARGE CURVED BAND
FEATURE MAINLY IN THE WEST SEMICIRCLE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT TD SEVEN-E
IS NOT FAR FROM BECOMING A TROPICAL STORM. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TAKES THE INTENSITY UP AT THE RATE OF ONE T-NUMBER PER 24 HOURS
THROUGH 36 HOURS WITH A GENERAL LEVELING OFF IN INTENSITY AFTERWARDS
AS THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER 26C OR COOLER SSTS. THE
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN IS GOOD IN ALL QUADRANTS...EXCEPT
RESTRICTED TO THE NORTHWEST...WHICH SHOULD SUPPORT THE SYSTEM

TROPICAL DEPRESSION SEVEN-E HAS CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY ORGANIZE
DURING THE DAY...AT LEAST IN VISIBLE IMAGERY.  WHILE SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES WERE BELOW TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH AT 18Z...AN
INNER CONVECTIVE REGION HAS SINCE FORMED WITH A RAGGED OUTER BAND
WRAPPED MORE THAN HALF WAY AROUND IT.  ON THIS BASIS...THE
DEPRESSION IS UPGRADED TO 35 KT TROPICAL STORM EMILIA.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 305/7.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A
MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER NEW MEXICO...AND VISIBLE SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOWS LOW LEVEL RIDGING NORTHWEST OF EMILIA.  THIS
COMBINATION SHOULD EVENTUALLY TURN THE STORM WESTWARD.  TRACK
GUIDANCE BASED ON THE AVN MODEL GENERALLY AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO.
HOWEVER...THE UKMET AND NOGAPS INDICATE A SOUTHWESTERLY TURN.  IT IS
UNCLEAR WHAT COULD CAUSE THIS...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE
TRACKS OF THE AVN-BASED MODELS.
 
WHILE EMILIA SHOWS AN EXCELLENT BANDING PATTERN AT THIS TIME...THE
CYCLONE IS LARGE AND INFRARED IMAGERY INDICATES THE CONVECTION IS
NOT VERY CONCENTRATED.  THUS...IT IS NOT LIKELY TO SPIN UP AS
RAPIDLY AS DANIEL DID.  THE SHIPS MODEL TAKES EMILIA TO NEAR MINIMAL
HURRICANE IN ABOUT 48 HR.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST FOLLOWS THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND MAKES EMILIA A HURRICANE IN 36 HR...FOLLOWED BY
WEAKENING OVER COLDER WATER.  HOWEVER...IF EMILIA TAKES LONGER TO
CONSOLIDATE THAN FORECAST...IT MAY NOT REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH
BEFORE IT REACHES THE COLD WATER.

VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW A VERY WELL DEFINED LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION AND ORGANIZATION...IN FACT THE PATTERN RESEMBLES A
BANDING TYPE-EYE.  BUT THE CONVECTION IS NEITHER STRONG NOR
CONCENTRATED NEAR THE BROAD CENTER OF CIRCULATION YET.  T-NUMBERS
ARE 2.5+ AND 3.0 FROM TAFB AND SAB AND ON THIS BASIS...WINDS ARE
INCREASED TO 40 KNOTS. ALTHOUGH THE SHEAR IS LOW AND VERY FAVORABLE
FOR STRENGTHENING...EMILIA HAS ONLY 36 HOURS OVER WARM WATERS TO
REACH HURRICANE STATUS.  THEREAFTER...A STEADY STATE FOLLOWED BY A
SLOW WEAKENING IS INDICATED.
 
THE FUTURE INTENSITY IS BASED ON THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK WHICH
CALLS FOR A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST AND THEN WESTWARD TRACK AS THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE NORTH OF EMILIA BUILDS WESTWARD.  HOWEVER...THE
RELIABLE UK MODEL ALONG WITH NOGAPS BUILD THE RIDGE STRONGER THAN
THE OTHER MODELS AND TAKE EMILIA ON MORE WEST-SOUTHWEST TRACK. IF
THIS TURNS OUT TO BE CORRECT...EMILIA WILL BE OVER WARM WATER MUCH
LONGER AND INTENSIFICATION SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH 72 HOURS.  AT
THIS TIME...THE PREFERRED OPTION IS TO FOLLOW THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACK AND THE AVN MODEL AND NOT THE UK/NOGAPS SOLUTION.

EMILIA IS NOT LOOKING TOO IMPRESSIVE ON IR IMAGERY AT THIS TIME. 
THERE IS A LACK OF DISTINCT BANDING FEATURES.  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
INTERMITTENT BURSTS OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER...OVERALL THE
CENTRAL FEATURES ARE RATHER RAGGED-LOOKING.  IT IS PRESUMED THAT
THIS IS A TEMPORARY CONDITION AND SINCE THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS
EXPECTED TO REMAIN WEAK...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AS IN PREVIOUS
ADVISORIES...AND SIMILAR TO THE SHIPS MODEL.  AS DISCUSSED
EARLIER...IF THE STORM TURNS MORE SHARPLY TO THE LEFT THAN FORECAST
THEN IT WILL REMAIN OVER WARMER WATERS AND COULD STRENGTHEN MORE
THAN SHOWN HERE.

THE CENTER IS NOT WELL-DEFINED EITHER ON IR OR MICROWAVE IMAGERY. 
INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 300/8.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
SHOWS A 500 MB RIDGE BUILDING ACROSS BAJA CALIFORNIA DURING THE NEXT
3 DAYS.  WITH THIS PATTERN...A MORE WESTWARD STEERING CURRENT IS
LIKELY TO EVOLVE.  THEREFORE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TURNS THE SYSTEM
GRADUALLY WESTWARD...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS SOUTH OF MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE MODEL
TRACKS...EXCEPT FOR THE U. K. MET. OFFICE AND GFDL MODELS WHICH ARE
A DEGREE OR TWO TO THE SOUTH OF MY FORECAST.

EMILIA IS STILL NOT MAKING MUCH OF AN IMPRESSION ON IR IMAGERY THIS
MORNING...ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION
NEAR THE PRESUMED CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE
45...45...AND 35 KT FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA...RESPECTIVELY.  THE
CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 45 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  SHEAR IS
LIGHT AND EMILIA SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST 24 HOURS OVER RELATIVELY WARM
WATER...SO SOME SHORT-TERM STRENGTHING IS ANTICIPATED.

THE CENTER REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON IR IMAGERY BUT MAY BE A
LITTLE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED
TO BE 305/9.  BOTH THE NCEP AND UKMET GLOBAL MODELS BUILD A 500 MB
RIDGE WESTWARD NORTH OF THE CYCLONE OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  WITH
THIS PATTERN...A MORE WESTWARD STEERING CURRENT IS LIKELY TO EVOLVE.

IN FACT...THE UKMET DRIVES EMILIA TO THE SOUTHWEST AFTER 24 HOURS...
BUT A SIMILAR FORECAST YESTERDAY HAS SO FAR FAILED TO VERIFY.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL GUIDANCE.  

IF THE UKMET IS CORRECT AND EMILIA REMAINS SOUTH OF THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK...THEN THE INTENSITY IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER THAN
FORECAST.

THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE ORGANIZATION OF EMILIA THIS
AFTERNOON...WITH MICROWAVE IMAGERY INDICATING THE BEGINNINGS OF AN
EYEWALL.  FOR A TIME THERE WAS A CLEAR SPOT NEAR THE CENTER IN THE
VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY.  SATELLITE DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS WERE 50

INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 55 KT WITH THIS ADVISORY.

EMILIA ACCELERATED AND IS NOW MOVING 305/12.  THE AVN AND UKMET BOTH
HINT AT A MID-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE SOUTH AND WEST OF THE CYCLONE THAT
MAY BE INCREASING THE ENVIRONMENTAL STEERING FLOW.  THIS TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO WEAKEN AND MOST OF THE GUIDANCE ACTUALLY SHOWS LESS NET
72 H DISPLACEMENT NOW THAN IT DID 6 HOURS AGO.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK SLOWS THE FORWARD MOTION AFTER 12 HOURS AND IS
SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

GIVEN THE MORE RAPID MOTION TODAY...EMILIA WILL ENCOUNTER COOLER

CONVECTION THIS TIME.  EMILIA IS ABOUT TO MOVE IN A FEW HOURS OVER

ASSOCIATED CONVECTION HAS DISSIPATED.  WHILE SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM AFWA...TAFB...AND SAB ARE 65 KT...55 KT...AND 55 KT
RESPECTIVELY...THE LACK OF CONVECTION AND THE MOTION OVER COOLER
WATER SUGGESTS A SOMEWHAT LOWER INTENSITY.  THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE
SET TO 50 KT IN THIS ADVISORY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 305/12.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE
MID/UPPER LEVEL HIGH OVER ARIZONA...NEW MEXICO...AND NORTHWEST
MEXICO.  THERE IS ALSO A TROUGH DEVELOPING ALONG 120W N OF 17N. 
THIS COMBINATION SUGGESTS A CONTINUED NORTHWEST MOTION.  HOWEVER...
SINCE EMILIA IS MOVING INTO TO COOLER WATER AND SHOULD WEAKEN...LOW
LEVEL STEERING SHOULD EVENTUALLY DOMINATE.  THIS WOULD TURN THE
CYCLONE WESTWARD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES WITH THE LATTER
IDEA...CALLING FOR AN INITIAL NORTHWEST MOTION FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL
WESTWARD TURN.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THAT EMILIA IS ENTRAINING DRY AIR FROM
THE TROUGH TO THE WEST.  A COMBINATION OF THIS AND THE COOLER WATER
MEANS THE STORM IS IN TROUBLE.  THE QUESTION IS HOW FAST WILL IT
WEAKEN?  STATISTICAL INTENSITY GUIDANCE CALLS FOR SLOW WEAKENING...
WITH EMILIA SURVIVING AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE (EVEN TROPICAL STORM)
THROUGH 72 HR.  ON THE OTHER HAND...THE GFDL AND GFDN BOTH DISSIPATE
THE SYSTEM IN LESS THAN 60 HR.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A
FASTER WEAKENING THAN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...ALTHOUGH NOT AS FAST AS
THE GFDL AND GFDN.  HOWEVER...IT WOULD BE NOT BE TOO SURPRISING IF
EMILIA DISSIPATED BEFORE 72 HR.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS REDEVELOPED NEAR THE CENTER OF EMILIA...BUT
NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR HAS KEPT THE CONVECTION FROM WRAPPING AROUND THE

THE NEW CONVECTIVE BURST AND IS CONSISTENT WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY

THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK.
EMILIA IS EXPECTED TO TRACK IN A GENERAL NORTHWEST OR WEST-NORTHWEST
DIRECTION OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS WHILE WEAKENING. AFTERWARDS...
EMILIA IS EXPECTED TO BE STEERED MORE TO THE WEST AS THE LOW LEVEL
CENTER DECOUPLES FROM THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION OWING TO
THE SYSTEM PASSING OVER VERY COLD WATER. THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS CLOSE
TO THE GFDL THROUGH 24 HOURS AND THEN FOLLOWS THE MEDIUM AND SHALLOW

ALTHOUGH DEEP CONVECTION HAS RECENTLY REDEVLOPED...THE GENERAL TREND
SHOULD BE FOR AN OVERALL DECREASE IN CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION AS
EMILIA PASSES OVER MUCH COLDER...21C TO 22C... WATER AFTER 24 HOURS.

CURRENTLY PRESENT...SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...

THE TRACK FORECAST IS FAIRLY SIMPLE.  EMILIA IS MOVING 275/10 SOUTH
OF A LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE.  THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL
THE CYCLONE DISSIPATES.  ONE POSSIBLE ALTERNATE SCENARIO IS THAT
STRONG LOW-LEVEL NORTHERLY FLOW SEEN ON SATELLITE IMAGERY NORTH AND
WEST OF EMILIA COULD PUSH IT SOUTH OF WEST.  THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF
THIS HAPPENING SO FAR...AND NONE OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS MOVE

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS ALSO FAIRLY SIMPLE.  EMILIA IS TRACKING
INTO PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATER.  ADDITIONALLY...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES A UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WITH LOTS OF SUBSIDENCE AND DRY AIR

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SOUTHWEST OF
BAJA CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED SINCE YESTERDAY AND IS
BEING UPGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION EIGHT-E AT THIS TIME.
THE DEPRESSION HAS A LARGE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION...BUT EASTERLY
SHEAR IS KEEPING THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER ON THE EASTERN EDGE AND MOST
OF THE OUTFLOW LIMITED TO THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  BECAUSE THE
DEPRESSION IS STILL IN THE FORMATIVE STAGE...SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE
INITIAL LOCATION MAY BE NECESSARY.  THE OCEAN IS ABOUT 26 OR 27
DEGREES AND THE EASTERLY SHEAR IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT
STRENGTHENING.  THE DEPRESSION MAY BECOME A TROPICAL STORM LATER
TODAY.
 
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/11. THERE IS A STRONG
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION WHICH IS FORECAST
TO BUILD WESTWARD.  THIS PATTERN WOULD PROVIDE A WESTERN STEERING
THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD.  BASED ON THE FORECAST STRENGTHENING

TROPICAL STORM FABIO HAS LOST MOST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE
SYSTEM CENTER DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS EXCEPT FOR A RECENT CONVECTIVE
BURST IN THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB AND SAB SUPPORT MINIMUM TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY BASED ON THE
FULLY EXPOSED LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER. OUTFLOW IS FAIR IN THE
WEST SEMICIRCLE AND SEVERELY RESTRICTED ELSEWHERE DUE TO STRONG
UPPER-LEVEL NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 280/08. ALL AVAILABLE MODEL GUIDANCE KEEPS FABIO
ON A GENERAL WESTERLY COURSE THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE
UPPER-LEVEL NORTHEAST TO EASTERLY FLOW SHOULD KEEP MOST OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION IN THE WEST SEMICIRCLE THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS...WHICH
WILL ALSO HELP TO KEEP THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION TRACKING TO THE
WEST IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MEAN SHEAR VECTOR. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AND NEAR THE MIDDLE OF
THE OBJECTIVE AIDS ENVELOPE...AND CLOSE TO THE SPEED OF THE UKMET
MODEL.

MODERATE TO STRONG UPPER-LEVEL EASTERLY SHEAR IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS WHICH SHOULD LIMIT ANY SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTHENING. HOWEVER...BY 36 HOURS...MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS
INDICATE THAT THE SHEAR WILL WEAKEN AND FABIO WILL MOVE UNDER OR
CLOSE TO A 200 MB RIDGE AXIS WHICH SHOULD FAVOR SOME STRENGTHENING
EVEN THOUGH THE SYSTEM WILL BE MOVING OVER COOLER SSTS. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE SHIPS MODEL WHICH BRINGS FABIO TO 55 KT IN
48 HOURS AND THEN LEVELS OFF THROUGH 72 HOURS. HOWEVER...IF THE
SHEAR LETS UP SOONER THEN EXPECTED...FABIO COULD INTENSIFY A LITTLE
FASTER AND MORE THAN WE ARE INDICATING...POSSIBLY TO MINIMUM
HURRICANE INTENSITY.

THE WIND RADII WERE ADJUSTED TO FAVOR THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE FOR THE
NEXT 24 HOURS DUE TO THE EXPECTED CONVECTIVE ASYMMETRY OWING TO THE
EASTERLY SHEAR PATTERN.

SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER OF FABIO THIS EVENING.  SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE 45 KT...45 KT...AND 35

FORECAST PERIOD.  ALL TRACK GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A SOUTHWESTWARD TURN
MAY OCCUR BY 72 HR...WITH THE BAMM AND BAMD TAKING FABIO TO 13N. 
THIS FORECAST COULD BE DUE EITHER TO A STRENGTHENING OF THE RIDGE OR
TO INTERACTION WITH TROPICAL DEPRESSION NINE-E TO THE EAST.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL NOT FULL FOLLOW THIS UNCLIMATOLOGICAL
GUIDANCE...BUT WILL SHOW FABIO LOSING A LITTLE LATITUDE BY 72 HR.

CONVECTIVE BURSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FABIO ARE STILL STRONG AND CLOSE

DECREASE DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS...COMBINED WITH A
POSSIBLE SOUTHWESTWARD MOTION TOWARD WARMER WATER...COULD OPEN THE

PREVIOUS DEEP CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPED NEAR THE SYSTEM CENTER HAS
BEEN DISPLACED WELL TO THE WEST OF LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION...AND FOR
THIS REASON WE HAVE HELD THE INTENSITY AT 40 KT.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 275/09. FABIO IS BEING INFLUENCED BY THE EASTERLY
FLOW AROUND THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH AND
ALSO BY THE NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR. ALL OF OUR FORECAST MODEL GUIDANCE
TRACKS FABIO WESTWARD THROUGH 24 TO 36 HOURS AND THEN WEST-SOUTHWEST
AFTERWARDS AS THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH BUILDS SLIGHTLY SOUTHWARD. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND
THE NOGAPS MODEL...AND SLIGHTLY SLOWER AND A LITTLE MORE POLEWARD OF

FABIO IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN A SHEARED STATE FOR MOST OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD. HOWEVER...BY 48 HOURS...THE FORECAST TO LET UP
SLIGHTLY AND FABIO WILL ALSO BE MOVING OVER WARMER SSTS. THE OFFICAL
INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR STEADY INTENSITY FOR THE NEXT 24

OF INTERMITTENT CONVECTIVE BURSTS.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM AFWA...TAFB...AND SAB ARE 35 KT...30 KT...AND 30 KT.  AS THE
CONVECTIVE BURSTS ARE GETTING WEAKER AND FARTHER FROM THE CENTER...
FABIO IS DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 260/9.  A STRONG DEEP LAYER RIDGE CONTINUES
NORTH AND NORTHWEST OF FABIO... WHICH SHOULD PUSH THE CYCLONE
WESTWARD TO WEST-SOUTHWESTWARD.  TRACK FORECAST GUIDANCE GENERALLY
AGREES WITH THIS...ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME SPREAD IN BOTH DIRECTION
AND SPEED.  THE LBAR CALLS FOR A MORE WESTERLY TRACK...WHILE THE
NHC91 IS MORE SOUTHWESTERLY.  THE NOGAPS CALLS FOR A FASTER MOTION
TO 13N139W BY 72 HR...WHILE THE SLOWER BAM MODELS ARE CLUSTERED NEAR

IF THE SHEAR EVER DECREASES...FABIO IS LIKELY TO STAY OVER WATER
WARM ENOUGH FOR STRENGTHENING.  THE LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THE
SHEAR MAY DECREASE...AND THE SHIPS MODEL RESPONDS TO THIS BY TAKING
FABIO TO 60 KT IN 72 HR.  SINCE FABIO IS CURRENTLY WEAKENING...THE

FABIO CONTINUES AS A WELL-DEFINED LOW CLOUD SWIRL WITH BURSTS OF
CONVECTION ABOUT 60 NM SW OF THE CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE ALL 30 KT...SO THAT WILL BE THE MAXIMUM WINDS FOR THIS
ADVISORY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 265/8.  THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE SYNOPTIC
PATTERN FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  HOWEVER...THE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE IS NOT INDICATING AS MUCH SOUTHWESTERLY MOTION AS 6 HR AGO.
THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF GILMA TO THE EAST.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...ALTHOUGH A
LITTLE SLOWER AT THE END DUE TO THE POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF GILMA.  IF
FABIO AND GILMA DO INTERACT AS FORECAST BY THE AVN AND UKMET
MODELS... THE SMALLER FABIO COULD HAVE SOME VERY ERRATIC MOTION. 

FABIO CONTINUES UNDER EASTERLY SHEAR...AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES UPPER LEVEL DRY AIR NEAR THE CYCLONE.  DESPITE THIS...THE
SHIPS MODEL STILL WANTS TO DEVELOP THE SYSTEM...AND LARGE-SCALE
MODELS CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY THE SHEAR MAY DECREASE.
THE INTENSITY FORECAST STILL CALLS FOR MODEST STRENGTHENING AFTER 24
HR.  HOWEVER...IF CURRENT LACK OF CENTRAL CONVECTION CONTINUES THE
CYCLONE MAY DISSIPATE INSTEAD OF STRENGTHEN.

FABIO HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE YESTERDAY. IT CONTINUES AS
A WELL DEFINED SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS WITH INTERMITTENT PATCHES OF DEEP
CONVECTION.  FABIO IS SOUTH OF HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WHICH IS FORCING
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO MOVE SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST-SOUTHWEST.
BECAUSE FABIO IS MOVING TOWARD WARMER WATERS AND THE SHEAR COULD
RELAX...THERE IS A CHANCE OF SOME REINTENSIFICATION.

TROPICAL STORM GILMA.  VIS SATELLITE LOOPS CLEARLY SHOW SOME OF LOW-
CLOUDS DEFINING THE CIRCULATION OF FABIO MOVING TOWARD GILMA. DEEP
CONVECTION IS VERY LIMITED AND MICROWAVE DATA SHOW THAT MAXIMUM
WINDS ARE LESS THAT 25 KNOTS. 

THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE IN 12 HOURS BUT WILL LIKELY
PRODUCE INTERMITTENT BURST OF CONVECTION DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.

THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SOUTH OF MANZANILLO MEXICO CONSOLIDATED 
RATHER REMARKABLY THIS EVENING...WITH LARGE BANDS OF CONVECTION
DEVELOPING NORTH AND SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER.  QUIKSCAT
SCATTEROMETER DATA INDICATES A SURFACE CIRCULATION WAS PRESENT
BEFORE THE LATEST CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. THUS...THE SYSTEM IS
UPGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION NINE-E.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS A TRIFLE UNCERTAIN...WITH THE BEST ESTIMATE OF
295/14.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATE A LARGE DEEP LAYER RIDGE NORTH
OF THE CYCLONE.  THIS SHOULD MOVE THE SYSTEM ON A WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK.  NHC TRACK GUIDANCE AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO. 
SINCE THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST...AND
TROPICAL STORM FABIO AHEAD OF IT IS MOVING WEST...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION FOR 24-36 HR
FOLLOWED BY A WESTWARD TURN.  THIS IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE
NHC91.

THE DEPRESSION HAS GOOD OUTFLOW AND STRONG CONVECTION...AND LARGE-
SCALE MODELS FORECAST CONTINUED FAVORABLE UPPER WINDS.  THUS...
STEADY STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST TAKES THE
SYSTEM TO HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 48 HR...ALTHOUGH THIS COULD HAPPEN

TROPICAL DEPRESSION NINE-E HAS CONTINUED TO GET BETTER ORGANIZED
OVERNIGHT...AND HAS INTENSIFIED INTO TROPICAL STORM GILMA BASED ON A
SMALL CDO FEATURE NEAR THE SYSTEM CENTER AND SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES OF 30 KT FROM SAB AT 0600Z.

INITIAL MOTION IS 295/12. TROPICAL STORM GILMA IS EXPECTED TO TRACK
WEST-NORTHWEST FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND THEN TURN MORE TOWARD THE
WEST AFTER THAT AS THE SYSTEM ENCOUNTERS THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO
THE NORTH. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF OUR FORECAST GUIDANCE AND
WE ARE SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE GFDL AND UKMET SOLUTIONS. 

A STEADY INTENSIFICATION OF ONE DVORAK T-NUMBER PER DAY IS EXPECTED
THROUGH 48 HOURS WITH A SLIGHTLY SLOWER TREND AFTER THAT. GILMA IS
OVER 28C SST WATER AND THE OUTFLOW PATTERN IS GOOD IN ALL QUADRANTS
...WHICH ALSO FAVORS STEADY INTENSIFICATION.

ALL ASPECTS OF THIS FORECAST PACKAGE.  CONVECTION IS ELONGATED
NORTH-SOUTH...AND THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE LOW-LEVEL CENTERS.  A

GIVEN THE ABOVE...THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AS 290/10.  THIS
PACKAGE IS BASED LARGELY ON CONTINUITY FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
AND THE FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR.  IF THE QUIKSCAT IS RIGHT...IT
WILL BE NECESSARY TO ADJUST BOTH THE TRACK AND INTENSITY FORECASTS
LATER TODAY.  SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE BRINGS GILMA TO 79 KT BY 72
HOURS...AND AN EXPERIMENTAL MODEL FROM MIT SUGGESTS 80 KT.  THE

A MORE NORTHERLY MOTION WOULD TEND TO LIMIT THIS STRENGTHENING.

VISIBLE IMAGERY TODAY HAS NOT DONE MUCH TO HELP DEFINE THE LOCATION

OBSERVED MOVING NORTHWARD FROM THE MOST PROMINENT AREA OF DEEP
CONVECTION.  THERE IS LIKELY NOT ANY WELL-DEFINED SURFACE
CIRCULATION AT THIS TIME.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE NO HIGHER

BEING DOWNGRADED TO A DEPRESSION WITH THIS ADVISORY.  IF THE
EASTERLY SHEAR LESSENS...AS SUGGESTED BY THE GLOBAL MODELS... THE
WATER WILL BE WARM ENOUGH TO SUPPORT REINTENSIFICATION.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS AGGRESSIVE THAN THE SHIPS
INTENSITY GUIDANCE WHICH FORECASTS 69 KT IN 72 HOURS.

WITH NO WELL-DEFINED CENTER...THE INITIAL LOCATION AND MOTION ARE
HARD TO DETERMINE...BUT THE BROAD LARGER-SCALE CIRCULATION HAS BEEN
RELOCATED TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.  THERE HAS BEEN A
SUBTLE CHANGE IN THE MODEL GUIDANCE...WHICH NO LONGER BEND THE TRACK

WHILE GILMA MAINTAINS GOOD OUTFLOW...ESPECIALLY OVER THE WESTERN

THIS SCENARIO IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CLIPER...GFDN AND NOGAPS
MODELS.
 
GILMA HAS DEVELOPED A LARGE CDO FEATURE OVER THE SYSTEM CENTER WITH
A HINT OF A WARM SPOT DEVELOPING IN THE CIRRUS CANOPY. GILMA IS
EXPECTED TO REACH HURRICANE INTENSITY LATER TODAY AND POSSIBLY EVEN
STRENGTHEN MORE THAN WE ARE INDICATING. THE CYCLONE IS CURRENTLY
OVER 28C TO 29C SSTS AND THOSE TEMPERATURES ARE VERY FAVORABLE FOR
RAPID INTENSIFICATION. HOWEVER...THE OUTFLOW PATTERN HAS BECOME
ELONGATED NORTH-SOUTH WHICH SUGGESTS SOME RESTRICTION OR SHEAR...AND
THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL ONLY TAKES GILMA UP TO 65 TO 70 KT IN 24
HOURS AS THE SYSTEM GRADUALLY MOVES OVER COOLER WATER.

GILMA HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN ORGANIZATION DURING THE MORNING...WITH
STRONG CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND GOOD OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE.  SATELLITE ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 65 KT AND 55
KT...SO THE CYCLONE REMAINS A 60 KT TROPICAL STORM.

THE CENTER IS A LITTLE HARD TO FIND...AND THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE
MOTION IS 285/10.  A DEEP LAYER RIDGE NORTH OF GILMA SHOULD KEEP THE
STORM ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR 24-36 HR.  THE UNCERTAINTY
INCREASES AFTER THAT TIME...AS LARGE-SCALE MODEL INDICATE A
WEAKENING OF THE MID LEVEL RIDGE THAT COULD ALLOW A NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION.  SINCE THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO STAY STRONG...A
WESTWARD TURN IS ALSO POSSIBLE AS THE CYCLONE MOVES OVER COLDER
WATER AND WEAKENS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE LATTER...MORE
CLIMATOLOGICAL SCENARIO.

GILMA MAY REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH BEFORE MOVING OVER COOLER SEA
SURFACE TEMPERATURES IN 12-24 HR.  SLOW AND STEADY WEAKENING IS
LIKELY AFTER THAT TIME.  SHOULD GILMA MOVE MORE NORTHWEST THAN
CURRENTLY FORECAST...IT WILL LIKELY WEAKEN FASTER THAN CURRENTLY

INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE 75 KT...55

PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND MANY OF THE NHC TRACK MODELS STILL CALL FOR A
NORTHWEST TRACK TOWARD THE WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE NORTH OF GILMA. 
HOWEVER...THE GFDL NOW CALLS FOR A MORE WESTWARD MOTION...WHICH ADDS
CONFIDENCE TO THE CURRENT WESTWARD TURNING FORECAST TRACK.
 
GILMA APPEARS TO BE EXPERIENCING SOME NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR...SO IT IS
LESS LIKELY THAT IT WILL BECOME A HURRICANE BEFORE REACHING COOLER

GILMA WITH GREATER CONFIDENCE.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW
280/7...QUITE A BIT SLOWER THAN EARLIER TODAY.  THIS MIGHT INDICATE
THAT GILMA IS ABOUT TO TAKE A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...A TRACK
WHICH THE GUIDANCE MODELS HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY...AND SO FAR
UNSUCCESSFULLY...SUGGESTING.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO A CUTOFF LOW
THAT CAN BE SEEN TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A TEMPORARY RIGHTWARD TURN...AND THEN A
BEND BACK TO THE WEST AS THE CUTOFF LIFTS OUT LATE IN THE FORECAST
PERIOD.

SATELLITE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE FROM 55 TO 77 KT...AND
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 60 KT.  THE LATEST SHIPS GUIDANCE

SATELLITE INTENSITIES RANGE FROM 75 TO 85 KT...AND THIS IS SUPPORTED

INITIAL MOTION IS 285/08. GILMA IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY INTERACT
WITH THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL TO THE NORTH WHICH
WILL SLOWLY TURN THE SYSTEM MORE WESTWARD BY 36 HOURS. THIS TRACK
SCENARIO IS SUPPORTED BY ALL OF OUR FORECAST GUIDANCE. HOWEVER...THE

ARE 35 AND 30 KT...RESPECTIVELY.  A QUIKSCAT PASS AT 0229Z SHOWED NO
WINDS HIGHER THAN 30 KT AND THIS IS THE OFFICIAL ESTIMATE FOR THIS
PACKAGE.  DISSIPATION IS EXPECTED WITHIN 12 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 295/6.  SYNOPTIC REASONING IS UNCHANGED
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ESSENTIALLY
AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.

SATELLITE IMAGERY AND A REPORT FROM SHIP ELXB9 INDICATE THAT THE
AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER SOUTHWEST OF MANZANILLO HAS BECOME
SUFFICIENTLY WELL ORGANIZED TO BECOME TROPICAL DEPRESSION TEN-E. 
THE SURFACE CIRCULATION IS STILL BROAD AND ILL-DEFINED AT THIS TIME.

WHILE CONVECTION HAS BEEN WANING SOME THIS AFTERNOON...THERE REMAINS
A HEALTHY BAND ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE DEPRESSION.  OUTFLOW LOOKS
QUITE GOOD BUT THERE ALSO APPEARS TO BE SOME EASTERLY SHEAR.  

THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO A LACK OF HISTORY BUT IS
ESTIMATED TO BE 270/14.  GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST AN INITIAL TRACK TO
THE WEST FOLLOWED BY A SOUTHWESTERLY TURN.  THE LATTER MAY BE DUE TO
STRONG MODEL DEVELOPMENT OF THE AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER TO THE
EAST OF THE DEPRESSION.  ASSUMING THAT THE MODELS HAVE OVERDONE THIS
DEVELOPMENT...I KEEP A DUE WEST TRACK WITH SOME SLOWDOWN IN SPEED.

THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO 64 KT IN 60
HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO THIS
GUIDANCE...BUT HURRICANE INTENSITY IS NOT FORECAST DUE TO DECREASING
WATER TEMPERATURES LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  IF THE CYCLONE
MOVES SLOWER THAN FORECAST THEN HURRICANE INTENSITY WILL LIKELY BE
ATTAINED.

THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH CHANGE IN THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE THIS EVENING.  THE OVERALL EXTENT OF DEEP
CONVECTION HAS DECREASED SOMEWHAT...A TYPICAL DIURNAL FLUCTUATION. 
THE ASSOCIATED UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW PATTERN IS FAIRLY
IMPRESSIVE AND TROPICAL STORM STATUS SHOULD BE ATTAINED ON FRIDAY. 
SINCE THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW LOOKS FAVORABLE...IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE
CYCLONE WILL BE ABLE TO REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH PRIOR TO REACHING
COOLER WATERS.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST FOLLOWS THE LATEST
SHIPS MODEL RUN QUITE CLOSELY.

SINCE THE SYSTEM IS BROAD AND THE CENTER IS NOT YET WELL 
DEFINED...CENTER FIXES AND INITIAL MOTION ARE STILL RATHER
UNCERTAIN.  THE 18Z RUN OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB
RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD...SO A
CONTINUED GENERALLY WESTWARD MOTION IS FORECAST...SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE GFDL MODEL IS THE ODD MAN OUT IN THE MODEL

TROPICAL STORM HECTOR HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED WITH
A GOOD BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE SYSTEM CENTER. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 55 KT BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF 55 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB. OUTFLOW IS FAIR TO GOOD IN
ALL QUADRANTS...EXCEPT RESTRICTED TO THE NORTH.

INITAL MOTION IS 255/06. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST TRACK OR FORECAST PHILOSOPHY. HECTOR HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERING
THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH...AND THE NORTHERLY SHEAR HAS
HELPED TO KEEP THE CONVECTION DISPLACED TO THE SOUTH OF THE
CIRCULATION CENTER. HOWEVER...BY 24 HOURS...THE SHEAR IS EXPECTED TO
BECOME NORTHEASTERLY AND EVENTUALLY TURN TO EASTERLY...WHICH SHOULD
HELP TO STEER HECTOR ON A MORE WESTERLY COURSE AFTER 36 HOURS.

THE NORTHERLY SHEAR IS NOT OVERLY HOSTILE...WHICH MAY ALLOW FOR SOME
DEEP CONVECTION TO SLOWLY DEVELOP ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LOW-
LEVEL CIRCULATION. THE SHIPS MODEL TAKES HECTOR UP TO MINIMAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY IN 24 HOURS...AND WE HAVE FOLLOWED THAT
TREND...ALTHOUGH A BREIF INTENSITY OF 70 KT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME.

THE INITIAL POSTION AND MOTION ARE UNCERTAIN...BUT THE CENTER
APPEARS TO BE NEAR THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION. 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN AT 55 KT.  SHIPS GUIDANCE DOES
NOT SUGGEST THAT HECTOR WILL REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH BEFORE IT
MOVES OVER COOLER WATER.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/05.  THE AVIATION AND UKMET
MODELS SHOW A RIDGE BUILDING WESTWARD TO THE NORTH OF THE STORM AND
ALL OF THE TRACK MODELS INDICATE A WEST OR WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION
THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS CHANGED LITTLE

HECTOR APPEARS TO BE DEVELOPING A BANDING-TYPE EYE WITHIN AN
IRREGULAR CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST AND GOOD OUTFLOW.  BEST ESTIMATE OF
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS 65 KNOTS OR MINIMAL HURRICANE. NO
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS
THEREAFTER...HECTOR SHOULD BEGIN TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF COOLER
WATERS AND WEAKEN 

HECTOR IS DRIFTING WESTWARD AND THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH
OF HECTOR SHOULD REMAIN IN PLACE OR STRENGTHEN DURING THE NEXT FEW
DAYS AS INDICATED BY GLOBAL MODELS.  HECTOR SHOULD INCREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST. THIS IS THE
GENERAL SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS.

SOUTHEAST.  THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO LOOK FAIRLY GOOD. 
HECTOR IS PROBABLY NEAR PEAK INTENSITY SINCE SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLING BELOW 26 DEG C SHORTLY.

A SLOW WEST TO WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION...NEAR 4 KNOTS...CONTINUES.
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC SUBTROPICAL RIDGE
TO THE NORTH OF HECTOR STRENGTHENING A LITTLE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE
OF DAYS.  SO...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A CONTINUED WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK WITH SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED LATER IN THE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
2 AM PDT MON AUG 14 2000

THERE HAS NOT MUCH CHANGE IN THE SATELLITE-OBSERVED STRUCTURE OF THE
HURRICANE.  INTERMITTENTLY...AN EYE WAS NOTED IN THE IMAGERY.  WATER
VAPOR LOOPS SHOW A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC VORTEX TO THE NORTH OF
HECTOR WHICH HAS BEEN ASSISTING THE OUTFLOW TO THE NORTHEAST. 
ALTERNATIVELY...IF THIS VORTEX MOVES CLOSER TO HECTOR...IT COULD
INCREASE THE SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR.  IN ANY EVENT...THE MAIN FACTOR IN
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS PASSAGE OVER PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATERS. 
HECTOR IS FORECAST TO GRADUALLY WEAKEN BACK TO A TROPICAL STORM IN A
DAY OR SO...AND WEAKEN MORE RAPIDLY THEREAFTER.  THIS IS IN LINE
WITH OUR BEST INTENSITY FORECAST GUIDANCE...SHIPS.

MOTION IS A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF PREVIOUS ESTIMATES...NOW
ESTIMATED TO BE 290/5.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS ADJUSTED A
BIT FARTHER TO THE NORTH FROM THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST...BASED ON
THE CURRENT MOTION AND OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTIONS.  HOWEVER IN VIEW
OF THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS OF A SUBSTANTIAL MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO
THE NORTH OF HECTOR...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF

HECTOR CONTINUES TO BE A COMPACT HURRICANE WITH AN INTERMITTENT EYE.
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE ABOUT 65 TO 75 KNOTS BUT BECAUSE
CONVECTION IS ON A WEAKENING TREND...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS KEPT
AT 65 KNOTS.  HECTOR SHOULD BEGIN WEAKENING IN ABOUT 24 HOURS WHEN
IT MOVES OVER COOLER WATERS.

HECTOR IS MOVING 290/07.  THERE IS A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE
EXTENDING FROM THE WESTERN UNITED STATES WESTWARD ACROSS THE PACIFIC

PATTERN WOULD MAINTAIN HECTOR ON A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST

IMAGERY NOW SUGGESTS SOME SOUTHERLY SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM.  MORE OF
THE LOW CLOUD LINES ARE BECOMING EXPOSED OVER THE SOUTHERN
SEMICIRCLE.  AN EYE IS NO LONGER VISIBLE ON GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE
PICTURES...BUT AN SSM/I IMAGE FROM EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON SUGGESTED
A 10-15 N MI DIAMETER EYE.  THE DEEPER CLOUDS WERE ALSO DISPLACED
NORTH OF THE CENTER ON THAT IMAGE...IMPLYING SHEAR.  HECTOR IS
STARTING TO BECOME INVOLVED WITH THE STRATOCUMULUS FIELD ASSOCIATED
WITH A STABLE AIR MASS TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST.  GRADUAL WEAKENING
IS FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND FOLLOWING THE SHIPS
GUIDANCE.

HECTOR IS MOVING A BIT TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...310/7...
APPARENTLY IN RESPONSE TO A SLIGHT WEAKNESS IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE TO THE NORTH.  THE AVN MODEL INDICATES SOME BUILDING OF THE
RIDGE DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND SO THE FORECAST TURNS THE CYCLONE
BACK TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST.  THIS IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE

HECTOR IS AT BEST JUST BARELY A HURRICANE...AND MAY VERY WELL BE
WEAKER.  A 06Z TRMM OVERPASS INDICATES THE EYE HAS DISSIPATED...AND
MULTISPECTRAL INFRARED IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT SOUTHEASTERLY SHEAR IS
TRYING TO EXPOSE THE CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE 65 KT...65 KT...AND 45 KT.  HECTOR WILL
REMAIN A 65 KT HURRICANE FOR NOW.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 310/8.  A STRONG LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGE IS
LOCATED NORTHWEST OF HECTOR...AND LARGE-SCALE MODELS SUGGEST THIS
RIDGE SHOULD BUILD A LITTLE EASTWARD DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD...
WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN HECTOR TAKING A MORE WESTWARD MOTION AT A
FASTER FORWARD SPEED.  NHC TRACK GUIDANCE GENERALLY AGREES WITH THIS
SCENARIO...AND THE NHC FORECAST TRACK IS DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE
GUIDANCE.

THE COMBINATION OF SHEAR AND COOLER WATER SHOULD CAUSE HECTOR TO
WEAKEN.  ALTHOUGH THE SHEAR MAY WEAKEN DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD...
THE WATER ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR
CONTINUED WEAKENING.  HECTOR IS FORECAST TO BE DISSIPATING BY 72
HR...AND THIS COULD OCCUR EARLIER IF THE SHEAR PERSISTS OR IF THE
CYCLONE MOVES NORTH OF THE FORECAST TRACK.

VISIBLE SATELLITE AND MICROWAVE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE DISTURBANCE
NEAR THE SOUTHWESTERN COAST OF MEXICO HAS DEVELOPED A WELL DEFINED
CIRCULATION AND A LOW-LEVEL CENTER SURROUNDED BY DEEP CONVECTION.
THE SYSTEM IS BEING UPGRADED TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION AT THIS TIME.
THE OUTFLOW IS ESTABLISHED AND THE WATER IS WARM SO THE DEPRESSION
IS EXPECTED TO BECOME A TROPICAL STORM WITHIN THE NEXT 12 HOURS. 

THE CENTER OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO MOVE TOWARD THE
NORTHWEST ABOUT 8 KNOTS DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS AND COULD
BRING TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS ALONG PORTIONS OF THE COAST.
CONSEQUENTLY TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ISSUED ACCORDINGLY. 
  
A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE EXTENDING FROM THE WESTERN UNITED STATES
WESTWARD ACROSS THE PACIFIC IS FORECAST TO REMAIN STRONG. THIS

THE TROPICAL CYCLONE HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND DVORAK
CLASSIFICATIONS ARE UP TO A 2.5 FROM THE TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER.
ACCORDINGLY THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM ILEANA. 
THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND THE STORM IS MOVING
OVER WARM WATER...SO CONTINUED STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  THE SHIPS
MODEL INDICATES EVEN MORE STRENGTHENING THAN SHOWN HERE.

THERE IS A FAIRLY STRONG 500 MB RIDGE EXTENDING FROM THE WESTERN
UNITED STATES WESTWARD ACROSS THE PACIFIC.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE
MODELS SHOW A GRADUAL TURN TO THE LEFT FROM THE CURRENT 305 DEGREE
HEADING.  HOWEVER...THE LATEST GFDL RUN SHOWS A TRACK SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE TO THE NORTH...KEEPING ILEANA CLOSE TO THE COAST AND EVENTUALLY
MOVING OVER SOUTHERN BAJA.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A WEAK
CYCLONIC CIRCULATION LOCATED NEAR 25N115W AT THIS TIME.  IT IS NOT
CERTAIN WHETHER THE GFDL MODEL IS RESPONDING TO THIS FEATURE OR NOT.

THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE OTHER
GUIDANCE AND IS SIMILAR TO THE STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL MODEL
TRACKS...BUT A BIT SLOWER.  THIS IS ONLY SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH OF
THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST TRACK.

ONLY A SLIGHT DEVIATION IN TRACK TO THE RIGHT COULD BRING TROPICAL
STORM FORCE WINDS TO THE COAST IN THE WARNING AREA.

A BURST OF STRONG CONVECTION HAS MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE
THE CENTER.  HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THAT THE STORM IS CONTINUING TO
MOVE BETWEEN NORTHWEST AND WEST-NORTHWEST.  A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD
THE LEFT IS FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORIES.  THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE GLOBAL MODEL PREDICTIONS OF A 500 MB RIDGE
BUILDING TO THE NORTH OF ILEANA OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  IN CONTRAST
TO SIX HOURS EARLIER...THE LATEST RUN OF THE GFDL MODEL IS MORE IN
LINE WITH THE OTHER GUIDANCE AND KEEPS THE STORM SOUTH OF THE BAJA
PENINSULA.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
MODEL TRACKS. 

CURRENT INTENSITY IS 40 KNOTS BASED ON THE AVERAGE OF FINAL T-
NUMBERS OF 3.0 AND 2.5 FROM THE TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER...I.E.
TAFB MIAMI...AND THE SATELLITE ANALYSIS BRANCH OF NESDIS.  HIGH
CLOUD MOTIONS IMPLY SLIGHT EASTERLY SHEAR OVER THE AREA...BUT THE
OUTFLOW APPEARS TO BE ADEQUATE FOR STRENGTHENING AND THE WATERS WILL
BE QUITE WARM FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THEREAFTER...WEAKENING
SHOULD COMMENCE AS ILEANA REACHES ABOUT 25 DEG C WATERS.  IT SHOULD
BE NOTED THAT THE SHIPS MODEL IS A BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE ON
STRENGTHENING THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

IF THE CURRENT TRACK PERSISTS...WARNINGS FOR THE COAST OF MAINLAND
MEXICO CAN BE LOWERED LATER THIS MORNING.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES CONTINUE TO BRING THE WINDS UP AND ARE
NOW 45 KNOTS FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB. ALTHOUGH THE OUTFLOW IS NOT
OUTSTANDING...THE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT AND THE SSTS ARE FAVORABLE
FOR A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING DURING THE NEXT 48 HOURS. ILEANA IS
FORECAST TO BECOME A 65-KNOT HURRICANE. 

ILEANA HAS BEEN MOVING TOWARD THE NORTHWEST OR 305 DEGREES ABOUT 8
KNOTS AND IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO MOVE AWAY FROM MAINLAND MEXICO.
HOWEVER...IT HAS BECOME A THREAT TO THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF BAJA
CALIFORNIA.  WATCHES AND WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.

THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF ILEANA WILL KEEP THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE ON A NORTHWEST TRACK FOR A DAY OR TWO.
THEREAFTER...GLOBAL MODELS STRENGTHEN THE RIDGE...FORCING ILEANA TO
MOVE ON A MORE WESTWARD TRACK.  HOWEVER...IF THE NORTHWEST MOTION
PERSISTS LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED...THE CENTER OF ILEANA COULD END UP
MUCH CLOSER OR OVER THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA BETWEEN 24 AND 36

...CORRECTED INTIAL WIND SPEED TO 55 KNOTS...
ILEANA HAS TRACKED MORE TO THE NORTH THAN ANTICIPATED AND CURRENT
MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 320/11.  GUIDANCE MODEL TRACKS INSIST ON A
TURN TO THE WEST...AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GLOBAL MODEL
PREDICTION OF A MID-TROPOPSHERIC RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE BAJA
CALIFORNIA PENINSULA DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  HOWEVER...WE MUST
ACKNOWLEDGE THE MORE NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN
OBSERVING...AND ADJUST THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FARTHER TO THE NORTH. 
THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST IS NORTH OF THE GUIDANCE SUITE AND TAKES
THE CENTER VERY NEAR TO THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA.  

WITH THE ADJUSTED FORECAST TRACK...IT IS NECESSARY TO ISSUE
HURRICANE WARNINGS FOR THE EXTREME SOUTHERN BAJA PENINSULA. 

DVORAK T-NUMBERS REMAIN NEAR 3.5 SO CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 55
KNOTS.  HOWEVER...THE STORM IS EXHIBITING AN IMPRESSIVE UPPER-
TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW PATTERN...AND IS MOVING OVER WARM WATERS. 
SO...ILEANA WILL PROBABLY REACH HURRICANE STRENGTH IN A FEW HOURS. 
THE CURRENT INTENSITY FORECAST IS IN FAIR AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS
MODEL.  THE GFDL MODEL DOES NOT SHOW MUCH INCREASE IN STRENGTH...BUT
THAT MODEL HAS LIMITED SKILL IN FORECASTING WIND SPEEDS.  WEAKENING

THE CLOUD PATTERN OF ILEANA IS NOT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE IN INFRARED
IMAGERY THIS MORNING.  HOWEVER...IT CONTINUES TO GENERATE GOOD
CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND IN SOME BANDS TO THE WEST.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 65 KT AND 55 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...SO THE
MAXIMUM WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 60 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION UP TO 06Z WAS 320/10.  HOWEVER...THE MOTION SINCE
THAT TIME MAY BE A BIT MORE WESTERLY.  THE LARGE-SCALE MODELS...
ESPECIALLY THE AVN...ARE HINTING THAT THE RIDGE NORTH OF ILEANA MAY
BE WEAKER THAT FORECAST EARLIER...AND NHC TRACK GUIDANCE RESPONDS TO
THIS WITH MORE NORTHERLY FORECAST TRACKS THAN 6 HR AGO.  THE BIGGEST
CHANGE IS IN THE NHC91E...WHICH HAS SHIFTED FROM A 72 HR POSITION
20.5N115.5W 6 HR AGO TO 29N117W NOW.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY DOES SHOW
AN UPPER LEVEL LOW NEAR 29N118W WHICH MAY BE RELATED TO THE
WEAKNESS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL SHIFT A LITTLE NORTH OF THE
PREVIOUS TRACK...AND IS DOWN THE MIDDLE OF A CLUSTER OF GUIDANCE
WHICH INCLUDES THE BAMD...NGPI...AND THE GFDL.  THIS IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN THE NORTHWARD SHIFTING GUIDANCE AND THE POSSIBLE MORE
WESTERLY MOTION.

THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE INTENSITY FORECAST FROM THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  ILEANA SHOWS GOOD ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW...AND VERTICAL
SHEAR IS FORECAST TO REMAIN LIGHT UNTIL AFTER THE STORM MOVES INTO
COLDER WATER IN ROUGHLY 36 HR.  THE FORECAST CALLS FOR STRENGTHENING
UNTIL THAT TIME...FOLLOWED BY WEAKENING.

...CORRECTION TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPH REFERENCE TO INITIAL
MOTION AND BEING NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...
 
ILEANA IS EXPERIENCING SOME SHEAR FROM THE NORTHEAST...BUT DEEP
CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED IN THE SOUTHWEST SEMICIRCLE OVERNIGHT AND
THIS MORNING.  THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN IS IMPROVING AND THE
OUTFLOW IS GOOD IN ALL QUADRANTS...EXCEPT RESTRICTED TO THE
NORTHEAST.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS BASED ON SATELLITE ESTIMATES OF
65 KT FROM TAFB AND 55 TO 60 KT FROM SAB.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/10.  THERE MAY BE SOME WOBBLE IN THE TRACK
DUE TO THE CONVECTIVE SHEAR PATTERN. HOWEVER...THE GENERAL DIRECTION
SHOULD BE TO THE WEST OR SLIGHTLY WEST-NORTHWEST THROUGH THE PERIOD
AS ILEANA BEGINS TO INTERACT WITH THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE
NORTH. THE GLOBAL MODELS ARE NOT DEPICTING THE RIDGE AXIS AS BEING
OVERLY STRONG...BUT IT SHOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO STEER ILEANA MORE
TOWARD THE WEST AWAY FROM LAND GIVEN THE RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE OF
THE CYCLONE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS BETWEEN THE UKMET AND
GFDL MODELS...AND IS A LITTLE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.
 
THERE IS ONLY A SMALL LITTLE CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY
FORECAST. THE INTENSITIES WERE BROUGHT DOWN SLIGHTLY BASED ON THE
FORECAST TRACK TAKING THE CYCLONE OVER PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATER AS
INDICATED BY THE LATEST NAVO SST ANALYSIS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH
THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL...EVEN THOUGH SHIPS INDICATES ILEANA WILL
BE MOVING OVER WATER WATER AND IN LOW SHEAR...WHICH WOULD NORMALLY
FAVOR SIGNIFICANT INTENSIFICATION.

CIRCULATION CENTER BASED ON VISIBLE IMAGERY AND A 1555Z SSMI
OVERPASS. THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 60 KT AND THE INITIAL
WIND RADII WERE ADJUSTED TO FIT THE ASYMMETRICAL CONVECTIVE PATTERN.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 280/09.  SOME LARGE WOBBLES IN THE TRACK MAY
CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS DUE TO THE SHEAR PATTERN AND ALSO DUE
TO THE LOW-LEVEL LEESIDE FLOW OFF THE MOUNTAINS OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
CREATING WEAK EDDIES. HOWEVER...THE GENERAL DIRECTION SHOULD BE TO
THE WEST-NORTHWEST THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. BY 48 HOURS...MOST
OF THE GLOBAL MODELS WEAKEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST
OF ILEANA...WHICH MAY CAUSE THE CYCLONE TO SLOW ITS FORWARD SPEED
AND GAIN A LITTLE MORE LATITUDE. THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS A LITTLE
SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK THROUGH 36 HOURS...AND THEN A LITTLE
NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK AFTERWARDS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
GFDL AND UKMET MODELS...AND THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS ON THE SOUTHERN
EDGE OF THE NHC FORECAST MODELS SUITE.
 
THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST OR PHILOSOPHY.
ALTHOUGH ILEANA IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR...ALL
OF THE GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE 200 MB FLOW WILL SHIFT AROUND
TO EASTERLY AND WEAKEN BY 24 HOURS. THE DECREASING SHEAR MAY ALLOW
ILEANA TO DEVELOP DEEP CONVECTION ON THE NORTH SIDE LATER
TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY DURING THE DIURNAL CONVECTIVE MAXIMUM PERIOD
TUESDAY MORNING. THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL ONLY SLOWLY INCREASES THE
INTENSITY TO 75 KT IN 72 HOURS...BUT SMALL SYSTEMS LIKE ILEANA CAN
SPINUP THE INNER CORE WIND FIELD MUCH FASTER THAN THE STATISTICAL
MEANS INDICATE. THE FORECAST TRACK KEEPS ILEANA OVER A NARROW
CHANNEL OF WARM SSTS THROUGH 24 HOURS...WHICH FAVORS CONTINUED
INTENSIFIATION.

FIRST VISIBLE IMAGES OF THE SYSTEM REVEAL THAT THE LOW-CENTER HAS

THIS INCREASE IN ORGANIZATION WARRANTS UPGRADING THE DISTURBANCE TO

SHEAR OVER THE AREA...SO ONLY MODEST STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN...BUT BASED ON A GOOD FIX AT 28/00Z AND
THE CURRENT CENTER POSITION...THE ESTIMATE IS 300/4.  GLOBAL MODELS
SHOW A MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH AMPLIFYING TO THE NORTH OF 20N

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW A WELL-ORGANIZED CYCLONE WITH BANDING
FEATURES MOST PROMINENT OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THE DVORAK T-
NUMBER FROM TAFB MIAMI IS NOW 3.0...SO THE SYSTEM IS UPGRADED TO A

WESTERLY SHEAR OVER THE AREA...IT IS NOT VERY STRONG.  HOWEVER THE
LATEST ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS SHOWS MUCH
STRONGER SHEAR A SHORT DISTANCE TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE STORM.  THUS
THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST HALTS THE STRENGTHENING TREND AFTER
A DAY OR SO.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS SLOW...295/04.  THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF JOHN IS QUITE WEAK AND FORECAST TO REMAIN SO...AS GLOBAL
MODELS SHOW A TROUGH NORTH OF 20N AMPLIFYING TO THE NORTH AND

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT MON AUG 28 2000
 
TROPICAL STORM JOHN HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING THE PAST 6
HOURS AND THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 55 KT BASED ON A
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF 55 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB. 
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS GOOD IN THE EAST SEMICIRCLE AND FAIR...BUT
IMPROVING...TO THE WEST.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/05.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK OR REASONING.  SATELLITE FIXES HAVE BEEN
COMING IN ON TRACK...SO THIS FORECAST IS SIMPLY AN EXTENSION OF THE
PREVIOUS TRACK.  ALTHOUGH THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH IS
WEAK...THE LOW-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE REMAINS QUITE STRONG AND JOHN
SHOULD BE STEERED ON A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK BY THE EASTERLY FLOW
TO THE NORTH.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SHALLOW AND MEDIUM BAM
MODELS...AND BETWEEN THE GFDN AND GFDL MODELS.

JOHN HAS BEEN UNDERGOING A PERIOD OF RAPID INTENSIFICATION FOR THE
PAST 12 HOURS...BUT IS NOW BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF SHIFTING TO A
MORE NORMAL RATE OF INTENSIFICATION.  A SMALL CDO FEATURE WITH
COLD...-80C OR COLDER...OVERSHOOTING TOPS HAS DEVELOPED NEAR THE
SYSTEM CENTER WHICH INDICATES JOHN IS STRENGTHENING.  ALSO...A
DISTURBANCE ABOUT 600 MILES TO THE WEST HAS BEEN RUNNING
INTERFERENCE AND DEFLECTING STRONG 200 MB SHEARING WINDS TO THE
NORTH OF JOHN.  THIS HAS ALLOWED THE OUTFLOW TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND
TO THE WEST...WHICH SHOULD FURTHER ALLOW JOHN TO REACH HURRICANE
INTENSITY IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS.  HOWEVER...THE WESTERN DISTURBANCE
HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF WEAKENING THE PAST FEW HOURS WHICH MAY ALLOW THE 
STRONG UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES TO IMPINGE ON THE WEST SIDE OF JOHN IN
ABOUT 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE SHIPS MODEL
IN TAKING JOHN TO 70 KT...THEN HOLDING STEADY AFTERWARDS EVEN THOUGH
THE SHIPS MODEL INDICATES THE SHEAR WILL BE LESS THAN 10 KT.

NOTE...THE 12 FT SEAS RADII WERE INCREASED BASED ON A 00Z REPORT
FROM SHIP PJOX LOCATED ABOUT 140 NM SOUTHEAST OF JOHN.

JOHN IS PRESENTING ABOUT THE SAME APPEARANCE ON INFRARED IMAGERY NOW
AS IT WAS SIX HOURS AGO...AND THE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB AND SAB REMAIN AT 55 KT.  ALTHOUGH OUTFLOW HAS BEEN EXPANDING
TO THE WEST...THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE SOME WESTERLY FLOW APPROACHING
THE CYCLONE AND UNDERCUTTING THIS OUTFLOW.  MOST OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION IS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CENTER...WHICH WAS DETERMINED
FROM AN SSMI PASS OBTAINED FROM THE NRL/MONTEREY TROPICAL CYCLONE
WEB PAGE.  THIS PASS ALSO SUGGESTS A PARTIAL CENTRAL RING OF HEAVIER
RAIN THAT COULD BE THE BEGINNINGS OF AN EYEWALL.

NONE OF THE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.  SHIPS
KEEPS THE SYSTEM ROUGHLY STEADY STATE FOR 36 HOURS AND THEN SLOWLY
WEAKENS IT.  NEITHER THE UKMET NOR THE GFDL FORECAST JOHN TO BECOME
A HURRICANE...BUT GIVEN THE GOOD INNER CORE ORGANIZATION THIS COULD
STILL HAPPEN AND I HAVE BACKED OFF ONLY SLIGHTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS
INTENSITY FORECAST.  THE SPREAD OF THE BAM TRACK MODELS SUGGESTS
VERY HIGH SHEAR LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST WEAKENS THE CYCLONE AFTER 36 HOURS.

THE TRACK FORECAST GUIDANCE IS HIGHLY DIVERGENT.  THE LBAR...DEEP
BAM...AND THE STATISTICAL MODEL TAKE JOHN ULTIMATELY TO THE
NORTHEAST.  THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE GENERALLY BENDS THE TRACK 
SMARTLY TO THE WEST AND THEN SOUTH OF WEST.  GIVEN THIS SPLIT...THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES SLOW...BUT LEANS TOWARD THE LATTER SOLUTION
AND IS NOT FAR FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK.

RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED OUTWARD IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT BASED ON
PERSISTENT SHIP REPORTS OF HIGH WINDS AND SEAS.

REMAINS GOOD IN THE NORTH SEMICIRCLE AND FAIR BUT IMPROVING

CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/6.  JOHN HAS BEEN BUCKING THE UPPER-
LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR WHICH HAS BEEN IMPEDING ITS WESTWARD
MOTION.  THE LOW- AND MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH IS STRONG ENOUGH
TO KEEP THE CYCLONE ON A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH 36
HOURS...AFTER WHICH THE STEERING FLOW COLLAPSES AS AN UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH TO THE NORTHEAST RETROGRADES TO THE SOUTHWEST.  ALL OF THE
MODELS AGREE ON JOHN SLOWING DOWN TO A CRAWL IN 36 HOURS...BUT THEN
SPLIT INTO TWO CAMPS EITHER TAKING THE SYSTEM SLOWLY NORTHEAST OR
SLOWLY SOUTHEAST.  WE HAVE CHOSEN THE LATTER SOLUTION BASED ON THE
THE LOW-LEVEL RIDGE TO NORTH BUILDING SOUTHWARD DUE TO THE COLD AIR
ADVECTION THAT IS EXPECTED BEHIND THE UPPER TROUGH.  THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THE FORECAST MODELS...EXCEPT THE UKMET WHICH
TAKES JOHN SLOWLY TO THE NORTHEAST.  HOWEVER...ALMOST ALL OF THE
MODELS KEEP JOHN WEST OF 140W LONGITUDE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.

JOHN HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIGHT OFF SOME MODERATE TO STRONG SHEAR TODAY
AND NEW DEEP CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE SYSTEM CENTER WHICH
HAD BEEN PARTLY EXPOSED ON THE WEST SIDE. THE SHIPS MODEL BRINGS THE
INTENSITY DOWN QUICKLY AND HAS JOHN A WEAK TROPICAL DEPRESSION IN 72
HOURS.  HOWEVER...WITH DECREASING SHEAR FORECAST IN THE NEXT 36
HOURS...AND JOHN FORECAST TO REMAIN OVER MARGINALLY WARM 26C
SSTS...SOME SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION IS POSSIBLE.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST MAINTAINS THE INITIAL INTENSITY THROUGH 24 TO 36
HOURS...WITH ONLY SLIGHT WEAKENING AFTERWARDS DUE TO A GRADUAL

THE CENTER OF JOHN IS OBSCURED BY COLD OVERCAST CLOUDS AND VERY
DIFFICULT TO LOCATE. THE HONOLULU SATELLITE UNIT PLACES IT WEST OF
140W WHILE THE LATEST SAB POSITION ISTO THE EAST OF 140W IN THE NHC
AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY. THE MOTION OF JOHN WILL REMAIN SLOW AND
SOMEWHAT ERRATIC OVER THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. THE CONVECTION HAS
DRAMATICALLY DECLINED SINCE THIS MORNING UNDER APPARENT INCREASED
SHEAR. FOR NOW THE INTENSITY IS KEPT ON ON A SLOW WEAKENING TREND
SINCE THE CONVECTION COULD REGENERATE. 

THE INITIAL MOTION OF JOHN IS SLOWLY NORTHWEST FOLLOWED BY A TURN TO
THE SOUTHWEST UNDER STEERING FROM THE TRADE WINDS. THIS TRACK IS
SLIGHTLY TO THE WEST OF MOST OF THE MODELS BUT IS IN BEST AGREEMENT
WITH THE UK AND BAM SHALLOW. LARSON

IN A MATTER OF A COUPLE HOURS JOHN LOST MOST ALL OF HIS DEEP
CONVECTION. APPEARS THAT THE SYSTEM FINALLY SUCCUMBED TO THE
PERSISTENT SOUTHWEST SHEAR. AM TEMPTED TO WEAKEN JOHN SUBSTANTIALLY
BUT WILL STAY WITHIN MODEL CONSTRAINTS THIS TIME AROUND AND DROP
JOHN DOWN TO 45 KT. THIS CONSERVATIVE APPROACH WILL ALLOW FOR THE
POSSIBILITY OF DEEP CONVECTION REFORMING. 

JOHN HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY THE LAST 24 HOURS. AS IS USUALLY THE
CASE WHEN THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF STEERING WINDS...THE MODELS MOVE
JOHN IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THE MAJORITY THOUGH MOVE JOHN SLOWLY TO THE
SOUTHWEST...SO WILL GO ALONG WITH THAT IDEA. ALL INTENSITY MODELS
WEAKEN JOHN OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS AS DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION THIRTEEN-E REMAINS POORLY ORGANIZED WITH
POSSIBLE MULTIPLE VORTICES WITHIN THE BROAD CIRCULATION AND MOST OF
THE DEEP CONVECTION IS WELL AWAY FROM THE MAIN CIRCULATION CENTER. 
THE INITIAL POSITION IS BASED ON CONTINUITY FROM THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST...THE LAST VISIBLE IMAGES...AND A 0605Z SSMI OVERPASS
SHOWING A GOOD MID-LEVEL CIRCULATION.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF 25
KT IS BASED ON SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 25 TO 30 KT FROM
TAFB AND SAB...AND A 0321Z QUIKSCAT OVERPASS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS STATIONARY OR A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST DRIFT
SINCE THE DEPRESSION IS EMBEDDED IN A LARGE COL REGION IN THE MEAN
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AXIS.  HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THE
MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE NORTH IS BEGINNING TO LIFT OUT AND
THE 01/00Z GLOBAL MODELS ARE FORECASTING THE RIDGE TO BUILD BACK IN
TO THE NORTH.  THIS SHOULD GRADUALLY INDUCE A NORTHWEST OR WEST-
NORTHWEST MOTION.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS TWO
FORECASTS...AND BETWEEN THE UKMET AND GUNS MODELS.

THE DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO REMAIN OVER 26C TO 27C WATER FOR MOST
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  WITH THE VERTICAL SHEAR FORECAST TO REMAIN
LOW...SOME INTENSIFICATION IS EXPECTED AND THE SYSTEM COULD REACH
TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH LATER TODAY.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY
FORECAST IS A LITTLE ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE DUE TO THE BROAD
CIRCULATION...BUT THE SYSTEM COULD BE STRONGER THAN FORECAST IF DEEP
CONVECTION DEVELOPS AND PERSISTS NEAR THE MID- OR LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION CENTERS.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL WAS IGNORED AFTER 24
HOURS SINCE IT WAS BASED ON THE LBAR MODEL WHICH RAPIDLY ACCELERATES
THE CYCLONE NORTHWARD...AND LBAR IS CLEARLY THE OUTLIER MODEL IN THE
06Z FORECAST SUITE.

A SIZEABLE CONVECTIVE BURST DEVELOPED OVER THE CENTER OF TROPICAL
DEPRESSION 13-E NEAR 08Z...BUT IS NOW DECREASING IN INTENSITY AS
EASTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR CONTINUES OVER THE SYSTEM.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE ALL 30 KT...SO THAT WILL BE THE INITIAL
INTENSITY ON THIS ADVISORY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NEARLY STATIONARY.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS
LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGING AND MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING NORTH OF THE
CYCLONE.  THIS COMBINATION IS CURRENTLY PRODUCING SLOW AND ERRATIC
MOTION.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THAT WHILE THE UPPER LEVEL
FEATURE SHOULD WEAKEN WITH TIME...SOME TROUGHING WILL CONTINUE
NORTH OR NORTHWEST OF THE DEPRESSION THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
THIS SHOULD ALLOW A SLOW WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION TO BEGIN.  TRACK
GUIDANCE IS SOMEWHAT DIVERGENT...WITH MODELS SUCH AS LBAR...BAMD...
GFDL...AND BAMM CALLING FOR A MORE NORTHWARD MOTION WHILE THE
NOGAPS AND THE UKMET CALL FOR A MORE WESTWARD MOTION.  WITH THE
CURRENT LACK OF MOTION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALMOST IDENTICAL
TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE GUNS ENSEMBLE. 
THE AVN MODEL SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERACTION WITH TROPICAL
DEPRESSION JOHN TO THE NORTHWEST...WHICH COULD COMPLICATE THE
MOTION.  AT THIS TIME THE FORECAST ASSUMES THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN.

THE CYCLONE REMAINS OVER WARM WATER AND IN A LIGHT TO MODERATE
EASTERLY SHEAR ENVIRONMENT JUST SOUTH OF AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS. 
THUS...STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR IF THE CONVECTION WERE MORE
PERSISTENT NEAR THE CENTER.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST ASSUMES THIS
WILL HAPPEN AND CALLS FOR MODEST STRENGTHENING OVER THE NEXT 24-36
HR.  AFTER THAT TIME...THE CYCLONE SHOULD TRACK INTO GRADUALLY
COOLER WATER WHICH SHOULD STOP INTENSIFICATION.

THE PREVIOUS BURST...WITH A WEAK BANDING PATTERN AROUND THE CENTER. 
HOWEVER...SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN 30 KT...SO THE

THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY.  THERE IS LITTLE
CHANGE IN THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...WITH LOW
LEVEL RIDGING AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.  ONE
ADDITIONAL FACTOR IS THAT A BAND OF LOW LEVEL WESTERLY FLOW EXISTS
JUST SOUTH OF THE DEPRESSION...WHICH MAY BE HELPING TO KEEP THE
SYSTEM STATIONARY.  TRACK GUIDANCE REMAINS SOMEWHAT DIVERGENT...WITH
MANY OF THE PREVIOUS MODEL TENDENCIES CONTINUING ON THIS PACKAGE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY TO THE SOUTH OF THE

2 AM PDT SAT SEP 02 2000
 
KRISTY HAS LOST MOST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION OVERNIGHT...BUT A FEW
CELLS HAVE RE-DEVELOPED NEAR THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER AND SOME BANDING
FEATURES HAVE EMERGED.  AS A RESULT...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
MAINTAINED AT 35 KT BASED ON SATELLITE ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB.

INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATE IS 290/4.  IT APPEARS THAT KRISTY HAS
FINALLY DECIDED TO START MOVING AGAIN IN A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST OR
WESTWARD DIRECTION.  DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE EXACT LOCATION OF
THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER...THERE MAY BE LARGE WOBBLES IN THE ACTUAL
TRACK OF THE CYCLONE UNTIL DEEP CONVECTION ONCE AGAIN CONSOLIDATES
AROUND THE SYSTEM CENTER.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...AND CLOSE TO THE MEDIUM BAM...UKMET...AND
NOGAPS MODELS...WHICH ARE MUCH FASTER THAN THE GFDL AND AVN MODELS.

KRISTY APPEARS TO BE WELL AWAY FROM ANY SIGNIFICANT SHEAR...OVER 27C
SSTS...AND INSULATED FROM ANY MAJOR DRY AIR INTRUSIONS.  THESE
CONDITIONS WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOME INTENSIFICATION SHOULD OCCUR. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE SHIFOR AND SHIPS INTENSITY
MODELS...BUT KRISTY REACHING MINIMAL HURRICANE INTENSITY BY 48 HOURS
CAN NOT BE RULED OUT IF THE CENTRAL CONVECTION REDEVELOPS LATER
TODAY.

THE CENTER AND INITIAL MOTION IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE ON INFRARED
IMAGERY.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/04.  THE 06Z AVIATION
MODEL SHOWS THE SYSTEM CAUGHT IN WEAK STEERING CURRENTS IN A COL
AREA BETWEEN HIGH PRESSURE AREAS TO THE EAST AND WEST.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS A WEST TO NORTHWEST DRIFT FOR 72 HOURS WHICH IS
THE GUIDANCE MODEL CONSENSUS...MORE OR LESS.

THERE IS PLENTY OF DEEP CONVECTION BUT IT IS NOT WELL ORGANIZED. 
CURRENT INTENSITY NUMBERS ARE 2.5 BUT T NUMBERS ARE ONLY 2.0
SUGGESTING A WEAKENING TREND.  THE WIND SPEED FORECAST IS REDUCED 5
DTO 10 KNOTS FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED ON THIS TREND BUT THE
FORECAST IS STILL FOR SLIGHT STRENGTHENING TO 45 KNOTS OVER THE NEXT
72 HOURS.

VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWS A LOW LEVEL CENTER EXPOSED FROM DEEP
CONVECTION AND KRISTY IS DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION ON THIS
BASIS.  ALTHOUGH THE SHIPS MODEL INDICATES THAT THERE COULD BE
REINTENSIFICATION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONSERVATIVELY FORECASTS
NO CHANGE THROUGH 72 HOURS.

THE CENTER IS RELOCATED BASED ON THE VISIBLE IMAGERY.  THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NEARLY STATIONARY.  THE GUIDANCE MODELS MOSTLY SHOW A WEST

ACELLERATES KRISTY TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST AT 10 T 12 KNOTS.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST OPTS FOR THE SLOWER MOTION SINCE THE 12Z AVIATION

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE A COUPLE HUNDRED
MILES SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF MANZANILLO MEXICO HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME
BETTER ORGANIZED.  THERE ARE SOME BANDING FEATURES AND STRONG
CONVECTION NEAR THE ESTIMATED CENTER.  THEREFORE...ADVISORIES ARE

TO THE NORTHEAST.  WATER TEMPERATURES ARE VERY WARM...ABOVE 29
DEGREES CELSIUS.  STEADY STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST...AT ABOUT THE
RATE SHOWN BY THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL INTENSITY GUIDANCE...SHIPS.

MOTION IS WNW...285/13.  GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A 500 MB RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  MOST OF THE
TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS A CONTINUATION OF A WEST-NORTHWEST TO WESTWARD
TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS...AND SO DOES THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  ON THIS

VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW A BAND OF CONVECTION WRAPPING MORE
THAN HALFWAY AROUND THE SYSTEM CENTER.  EVEN THOUGH THE SATELLITE
SIGNATURE SOLIDLY SUPPORTS TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY...A SHIP WITH
CALL SIGN VRUZ9 REPORTS 12 KNOT WINDS VERY CLOSE TO THE CENTER.  IT
IS PRESUMED THAT THIS OBSERVATION WAS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
STRENGTH OF THE CIRCULATION...BUT IT DOES CAST SOME DOUBT ON THE
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES.  AS A COURSE OF LEAST REGRET...AND
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM DOES LOOK IMPRESSIVE ON THE IMAGES...IT IS BEING
NAMED ON THIS ADVISORY.  CONDITIONS FAVOR CONTINUED INTENSIFICATION
AND LANE WILL LIKELY REACH HURRICANE STATUS.
 
THE TRACK IS SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
INITIAL MOTION IS 270/14.  THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS IN THE
INITIALIZATION OF THE 12Z AVN RUN SINCE IT SHOWS THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE SEVERAL DEGREES TOO FAR SOUTH.  IN ITS FORECAST...IT SPINS
UP A SECONDARY STORM ABOUT 5 DEGREES TO THE WEST OF LANE.  WITH THIS
SCENARIO...THE MODEL PULLS LANE NORTHWARD.  HOPEFULLY THIS PROBLEM
WILL BE RESOLVED WITH A RELOCATION OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IN THE
NEXT INITIALIZATION OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL.  IN ANY EVENT...A MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO PREVAIL TO THE NORTH OF LANE FOR
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THEREFORE A CONTINUED WESTWARD TRACK IS

LANE CONTINUES TO PRESENT AN IMPROVING SATELLITE DEPICTION WITH
TIGHT BANDING AROUND A WELL-DEFINED CENTER IN THE LAST VISIBLE
IMAGES...AND THE AREAL COVERAGE OF COLD CLOUD TOPS HAS BEEN
EXPANDING SINCE THEN.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 45 AND 55 KT
FROM TAFB AND SAB RESPECTIVELY.  THE SHIP THAT EARLIER REPORTED 12
KT EAST OF THE CENTER REPORTED 27 KT ABOUT 70 NM NORTH OF THE CENTER
AT 00Z.  THE INTENSITY IS RAISED TO 45 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY...BUT
THESE WINDS COVER ONLY A VERY SMALL AREA NEAR THE CENTER.

THE TRACK FORECAST TONIGHT PRESENTS SOME CHALLENGES ATYPICAL OF THE
EAST PACIFIC.  THE INITIAL MOTION HAS SLOWED CONSIDERABLY...AND IS
CHARITABLY ESTIMATED AS 260/9.  THE 18Z AVN DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A
GOOD INITIALIZATION OF THE STORM...SHOWING LANE AT THE WESTERN END
OF AN ELONGATED VORTICITY MAXIMUM.  THE AVN ROTATES LANE
SOUTHWESTWARD AROUND THE LATTER FEATURE...WHICH ITSELF IS FORECAST
TO STRENGTHEN BY THE MODEL...AND THEN TAKES THE CYCLONE SLOWLY
NORTHWARD.  THE BAM MODELS AND THE GFDL ALL RESPOND TO THIS WITH A
CONTINUED TURNING TO THE SOUTH.  THE UKMET INITIALIZATION AND LOW
LEVEL EVOLUTION APPEARS MORE REALISTIC...BUT IT TOO SHOWS LITTLE NET
WESTWARD PROGRESS OF THE CYCLONE.  THE KEY MAY BE SOME SOUTHWESTERLY
MID-TROPOSPHERIC FLOW AHEAD OF LANE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROAD LOW
NEAR 16N AND 123W...AS INDICATED BY SATELLITE WINDS FROM THE CIMSS
WEB PAGE.  THIS COULD CREATE A WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT FOR LANE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOR THIS ADVISORY IS SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER THAN
THE PREVIOUS TRACK...AND EVEN SO RETAINS A STRONGER WESTWARD
COMPONENT THAN ANY OF THE CURRENT DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE.

IF THIS SCENARIO PLAYS OUT...THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT SHEAR OVER
LANE AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD AND SO LITTLE INTENSIFICATION
IS SHOWN BEYOND 36 HOURS.

THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS IMPROVED JUST A LITTLE AND THERE ARE NOW TWO
AREAS OF DEEP CONVECTION. THE CENTER APPEARS TO BE LOCATED ON THE
NORTHERN EDGE OF THE SOUTHERNMOST CONVECTIVE BLOB. INITIAL INTENSITY
HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 50 KNOTS BASED ON DVORAK ESTIMATES. SOME
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED AS IN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND ACCORDING
TO SHIPS MODEL...IT IS MOSTLY DUE TO WARM WATERS SINCE SHEAR IS
LIKELY TO INCREASE.

LANE HAS CONTINUED TO SLOW DOWN AND IS NOW MOVING 265/08. MOST OF
THE GLOBAL MODELS DEVELOP A LOW-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER A
LARGE PORTION OF THE AREA SURROUNDING LANE.  THIS PATTERN WOULD MAKE
VERY DIFFICULT FOR LANE TO MOVE WESTWARD FOR A LONG TIME. HOWEVER

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN
ORGANIZATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS...WITH LITTLE EVIDENCE OF
BANDING FEATURES.  THE CENTER APPEARS TO BE NEAR THE NORTHERN SIDE
OF A BURSTING MASS OF CONVECTION.  THIS IS SUPPORTED BY AN
OBSERVATION FROM THE VESSEL ELXZ7 WHICH REPORTED WEST WINDS OF 30
KNOTS AND A PRESSURE OF 1003.0 MB ABOUT 80 N MI SOUTH OF THE
ESTIMATED CENTER.  THERE IS NOW SOME NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR OVER THE
SYSTEM AND THIS IS PROBABLY RETARDING THE INTENSIFICATION PROCESS. 
HOWEVER IT IS NOT BELIEVED THAT THE SHEAR...WHICH IS ABOUT 20
KNOTS...WILL PREVENT THE SYSTEM FROM STRENGTHENING INTO A HURRICANE
IN A DAY OR SO.

CENTER FIXES ARE UNCERTAIN BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE FORWARD MOTION
HAS SLOWED EVEN FURTHER...TO AROUND 6 KNOTS.  THE GLOBAL MODELS
INDICATE THAT LANE WILL BE EMBEDDED IN A BROAD LOW- TO MID-
TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH THAT EXTENDS WESTWARD FROM THE COAST OF MEXICO
THROUGH 120W LONGITUDE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  WITH THIS STEERING
ENVIRONMENT...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY MOVING VERY
FAR TO THE WEST.  TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE DIVERGENT...BUT THE U.K.

VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES REVEAL A CIRCULATION CENTER THAT IS
SOUTHEAST OF PREVIOUS LOCATION ESTIMATES.  APPARENTLY THE CENTER HAS
BEEN EXECUTING A CYCLONIC LOOP.  THIS WAS SHOWN BY THE GFDL MODEL
TRACK FORECASTS...BUT NOT QUITE IN THE SAME LOCATION.  LANE IS

THIS IS ROUGHLY THE SAME AS THE LATEST GFDL FORECAST...BUT A BIT
SLOWER.
 
THE CENTER IS PARTIALLY REMOVED FROM THE DEEP CONVECTION...AND THE
CLOUD PATTERN IS NOT THAT WELL ORGANIZED.  THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO A
COMBINATION OF NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE LARGER-
SCALE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION WITHIN WHICH THE STORM IS EMBEDDED. 
BECAUSE OF THE CURRENTLY DISHEVELED APPEARANCE OF THE STORM...NO
CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM.  THEREAFTER...

LANE IS DETERIORATING AS IT HAS BECOME ENTRAPPED IN AN ITCZ-LIKE
LARGE BAND OF LOW-LEVEL CYCLONIC FLOW AND CONVERGENCE THAT IS
PROVIDING COMPETITION AND LIMITING INFLOW.  NO DOUBT THAT SOME
NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR HAS NOT BEEN HELPFUL EITHER...AS THE  
CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY RAGGED.  THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS LOWERED TO 40 KT.  ONE POSSIBLE SCENARIO NOW IS
FOR THE RELATIVELY SMALL TROPICAL CYCLONE TO LOSE ITS IDENTITY AND
DISSIPATE WITHIN THE ITCZ.  ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT THE
CIRCULATION OF LANE WILL BE THE TRIGGER FOR THE CONSOLIDATION AND
DEVELOPMENT OF A LARGER CYCLONE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FAVORS THE
LATTER SCENARIO...CALLING FOR SOME ADDITIONAL WEAKENING OVER THE
NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS BEFORE REDEVELOPMENT.

MOTION OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS HAS BEEN JUST EAST OF DUE SOUTH AT
ABOUT 5 KT.  GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT LANE WILL SOON TURN BACK TO THE
NORTH AS A MID-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE EAST OF THE CYCLONE LIFTS AND
EASES THE SOUTHWARD STEERING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS
LINE OF THINKING.

IMPLYING THAT SOME INCREASE IN ORGANIZATION MAY BE STARTING. 
HOWEVER SINCE THIS IS NOT CERTAIN...NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS

BASED ON A BANDING FEATURE WEST AND SOUTH OF THE CENTER...DVORAK
T-NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED A LITTLE.  HOWEVER THE DEEP CONVECTION IS
BECOMING A LITTLE RAGGED-LOOKING AND THE CENTER IS NEAR THE NORTHERN
EDGE OF THE CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST.  CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS
NOW 40 KNOTS.  ASSUMING THAT SHEARING WILL NOT BECOME PROHIBITIVELY
STRONG... GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED...SIMILAR TO WHAT IS
SHOWN BY THE SHIPS MODEL.  THE GFDL MODEL SHOWS SOMEWHAT MORE
STRENGTHENING... BUT THAT MODEL HAS OFTEN HAD A POSITIVE BIAS IN ITS
INTENSITY PREDICTIONS.

LANE IS NOW MOVING NORTH-NORTHEAST...020/6.  ASSUMING THIS MOTION
CONTINUES THE STORM WILL COMPLETE ITS LOOP OVER ITS FORMER TRACK. 
THE HEADING IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY TURN TOWARD THE NORTH AND
NORTH-NORTHWEST WITH TIME...AS PER THE TRACK GUIDANCE.  THE MAIN
FORECAST PROBLEM IS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO SOUTHERN BAJA LATE IN THE
PERIOD.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC
TROUGH TO THE WEST OF NORTHERN BAJA.  EVEN THOUGH MOST OF OUR
GUIDANCE SHOWS A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST IN ABOUT 48 HOURS...THE
TROUGH FEATURE COULD STEER LANE MORE TO THE RIGHT.  THAT IS WHAT IS
SUGGESTED BY THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST
LIES BETWEEN THE GFDL AND THE REST OF THE GUIDANCE.

THE CIRCULATION OF LANE POPPED OUT FROM BENEATH THE CONVECTION
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON AND COMPLETED ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF A
REVOLUTION AROUND THE CENTER OF A LARGER-SCALE CYCLONIC
CIRCULATION...BECOMING LESS WELL-DEFINED WITH EVERY IMAGE.  THE
CIRCULATION CENTER THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING HAS LOST ITS IDENTITY
WITHIN THE LARGER BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE.  TO AVOID POTENTIAL
CONFUSION...AND BECAUSE THE GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT SOME SORT OF
VORTEX WILL TRACK GENERALLY NORTHWARD AND STRENGTHEN...WE WILL HANG
ON TO LANE AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOR NOW AND SEE IF THE BROADER
LOW CONSOLIDATES INTO A TRUE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  

THE CIRCULATION THAT REMAINS HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY STATIONARY FOR THE
PAST 24 HOURS OR MORE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A LITTLE SLOWER
THAN THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND LIES BETWEEN THE GFDL AND THE UKMET. 
GIVEN THE LARGE AMBIENT VORTICITY...CONVECTION...AND WARM WATER...IF
A TRUE CIRCULATION SURVIVES IT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
STRENGTHEN AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO SHIPS GUIDANCE.

A LARGE COLD CDO FEATURE HAS FORMED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  IT
IS NOT POSSIBLE TO KNOW FROM INFRARED IMAGERY IF A WELL DEFINED LOW
LEVEL CIRCULATION HAS CONSOLIDATED NEAR OR BENEATH THE CDO.  A
RECENT SSMI PASS IN INCONCLUSIVE AND SO IS NIGHT2 INFRARED IMAGERY. 
HOWEVER THE CDO IS IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH THAT I AM UPGRADING LANE TO A
35 KNOT TROPICAL STORM.  DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB AND KGWC
ARE IN THE 45 TO 55 KNOT RANGE BUT I AM RELUCTANT TO GO THAT HIGH
WITH THE UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING A LOW LEVEL CENTER.  THE FORECAST IS
TO 65 KNOTS IN 72 HOURS FOLLOWING THE SHIPS MODEL.  THE GFDL MODEL
FORECASTS EVEN HIGHER WIND SPEEDS.

WITHOUT A CENTER TO TRACK...THE INITIAL MOTION IS ASSUMED TO BE
STATIONARY.  ALL OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS FORECAST A MOSTLY
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS WITH A SLIGHT AND
GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE LEFT.  IT IS HARD TO SEE WHERE THE NORTHWARD
COMPONENT OF MOTION IS COMING FROM AS THERE IS A HIGH DUE NORTH OF
LANE AND A TROUGH JUST WEST OF CALIFORNIA AND BAJA CALIFORNIA.  IN
ANY CASE...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL AND UKMET
MODELS.  THE REMAINDER OF THE MODELS ARE FURTHER TO THE LEFT
SUGGESTING A DECREASING THREAT TO BAJA CALIFORNIA.

8 AM PDT FRI SEP 08 2000
 
LANE CONTINUES TO SHOW A COLD BUT BROAD CURVED CONVECTIVE BAND. 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 55 KT. 
HOWEVER...CONVECTION ATTEMPTING TO WRAP AROUND THE NORTH SIDE OF THE
CENTER HAS WARMED DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS...SO THE MAXIMUM WINDS
ARE INCREASED ONLY TO 40 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.  THIS MAY BE A BIT ON
THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE. 

THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 330/5.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER NORTHWEST MEXICO...
AND LARGE-SCALE GUIDANCE INDICATES THIS FEATURE WILL PERSIST THROUGH
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS HOW MUCH RIDGING WILL
BUILD WESTWARD NORTH OF LANE AND POSSIBLY FORCE LANE MORE WESTWARD. 
THE NOGAPS AND THE AVN BUILD MORE RIDGING...WHILE THE UKMET KEEPS A
WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE DUE TO A DEVELOPING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WEST OF
CALIFORNIA.  NHC TRACK GUIDANCE REFLECTS THIS DIVERGENCE IN
OPINION...WITH THE UKMET FOLLOWING A MORE NORTHWEST TRACK AND THE
AVN-BASED GUIDANCE CALLING FOR MORE OF A TURN TO THE WEST.  GIVEN
THE UNCERTAINLY...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL BE ADJUSTED ONLY
SLIGHTLY WEST OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK...IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE
UKMET.

VERTICAL SHEAR SEEMS TO HAVE DECREASED...AND WITH THE CURRENT COLD
CONVECTION THERE IS NO OBVIOUS REASON LANE SHOULD NOT STRENGTHEN. 
HOWEVER...INTERNAL DISORGANIZATION MAY BE SLOWING THE PROCESS DOWN. 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR LANE TO STRENGTHEN INTO A HURRICANE
BY 48 HR...FOLLOWED BY NO CHANGE AS IT MOVES INTO COOLER WATER. IF
LANE EVER GETS ITS ACT TOGETHER...IT COULD STRENGTHEN FASTER THAN
CURRENTLY FORECAST.

CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH LANE HAS BECOME BETTER WRAPPED AROUND THE
CENTER DURING THE PAST 6 HR.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE ALL
55 KT...SO THE MAXIMUM WINDS WILL BE RAISED TO 55 KT FOR THIS
PACKAGE.  THIS IS ALSO IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH A QUIKSCAT
SCATTEROMETER OVERPASS NEAR 13Z.  THIS DATA ALSO INDICATED THAT LANE
HAS A VERY LARGE CIRCULATION...AND AS A RESULT THE 34 KT WIND RADII
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY EXPANDED.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 330/5.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW
A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER NORTHWEST MEXICO...AND LARGE-
SCALE GUIDANCE INDICATES THIS FEATURE WILL PERSIST THROUGH
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE QUESTION REMAINS HOW MUCH RIDGING WILL
BUILD WESTWARD NORTH OF LANE?  THE AVN SUGGESTS THERE WILL BE MORE
OF A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE THAN 6 HR AGO...AND SOME OF THE AVN-
BASED GUIDANCE HAS SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT IN RESPONSE.  ON THE OTHER
HAND...THE UKMET AND THE GFDL ARE TO THE LEFT OF THEIR PREVIOUS
FORECASTS.  SINCE LANE SEEMS TO BE CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACK...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ONLY A SLIGHT NUDGING TO THE LEFT
OF THAT TRACK.

UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE FAVORABLE FOR FURTHER STRENGTHENING...AND NOW
THAT LANE IS FINALLY GETTING ORGANIZED IT SHOULD REACH HURRICANE

TRACK NORTHWEST AROUND A MID-LEVEL RIDGE ANCHORED OVER NORTHERN
MEXICO AND THE SOUTHWEST U.S. AFTER 36 HOURS...LANE IS EXPECTED TO

THE PACIFIC SUBTROPICAL RIDGE CURRENTLY LOCATED TO THE NORTH AND
NORTHWEST OF THE SYSTEM. THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT AND CONVERGENCE OF

LANE HAS UNDERGONE A BRIEF PERIOD OF RAPID INTENSIFICATION...WHICH

CONVECTION HAS WEAKENED SOME NEAR THE SYSTEM CENTER THE PAST COUPLE

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE WITH LANE OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS. 
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB CONTINUE TO RANGE FROM
77 TO 90 KNOTS AND SO THE MAXIMUM WIND ESTIMATE IS KEPT AT 85
KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THERE HAS BEEN SOME INCREASE IN THE
CONVECTION ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE VERY LARGE EYE...BUT LITTLE OR
NO ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY BEFORE THE HURRICANE MOVES
OVER COOLER WATERS IN A DAY OR SO.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST
IS SIMILAR TO THE SHIPS MODEL GUIDANCE.
 
THE EYE CONTINUES TO WOBBLE BUT THE LONGER-TERM MOTION ESTIMATE IS
300/9.  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE TO THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN DISCUSSED
IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  BOTH THE UKMET AND THE AVN WEAKEN THE
RIDGE TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST OF LANE AS A MID- TO UPPER-
TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE CURRENTLY NEAR 34N135W MOVES EASTWARD.  THE
NOGAPS KEEPS A STRONG ENOUGH RIDGE IN PLACE TO KEEP LANE ON A MORE
WESTWARD TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SIMPLY UPDATES THE PREVIOUS
TRACK AND REMAINS BETWEEN THE UKMET AND THE GFDL.  IF LANE WEAKENS
LESS RAPIDLY THAN FORECAST THEN A TRACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST BECOMES LIKELY.  IN ANY EVENT...LARGE QUANTITIES OF
MOISTURE FROM LANE ARE EXPECTED TO SPREAD OVER NORTHWESTERN MEXICO
AND THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. STATES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

WHILE THE CONVECTIVE PATTERN IS MORE SYMMETRIC THAN EARLIER AND THE
EYE HAS CONTRACTED A BIT...THE CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED.  DVORAK T
NUMBERS FROM TAFB HAVE BEEN 4.5...77 KT...FOR 12 HOURS NOW...AND SO
THE INTENSITY IS LOWERED TO 80 KT.  LANE WILL BE MOVING OVER COOLER
WATERS WITHIN 12 TO 24 HOURS AND SHOULD THEN SLOWLY SPIN DOWN. 
SHEAR IS EXPECTED TO BE LOW AND GIVEN THE LARGE ENVELOPE OF THIS
SYSTEM...THE FORECAST DECAY IS NOT AS FAST AS THE SHIPS GUIDANCE OR
AS SUGGESTED BY THE UKMET.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS STILL 300 DEGREES BUT THE FORWARD SPEED HAS
BEEN DECREASING OVER THE PAST 18 HOURS.  THIS PROBABLY INDICATES
THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTHEAST OF LANE
IS DECREASING AS THE HURRICANE APPROACHES THE MID TO UPPER-LEVEL
CYCLONE WEST OF CALIFORNIA.  BOTH THE UKMET AND THE AVN WEAKEN THE
RIDGE TO THE NORTH AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NOGAPS...THE
GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH A NORTHWARD TURN AFTER 48 HOURS. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND
VERY CLOSE TO THE GFDL.

LARGE QUANTITIES OF MOISTURE FROM LANE ARE EXPECTED TO SPREAD OVER
NORTHWESTERN MEXICO AND THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. STATES OVER THE NEXT

HURRICANE LANE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AS INDICATED BY WARMING CLOUD
TOPS IN THE EYEWALL...AND ALSO BY SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF
75 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.  THE OUTFLOW PATTERN REMAINS
SYMMETRICAL WITH A GOOD OUTFLOW CHANNEL IN THE EAST SEMICIRCLE.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/9.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE
PREVIOUS TRACK FORECAST OR REASONING.  ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS
GRADUALLY ERODE THE MID- AND UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF LANE
AS A TROUGH WEST OF CALIFORNIA AS SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHIFTS
EASTWARD.  ALL AVAILABLE MODEL GUIDANCE REMAINS IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN
TAKING LANE MORE NORTHWARD AFTER 48 HOURS.  THE LONE OUTLIER IS THE
UKMET MODEL WHICH DISSIPATES THE CYCLONE BY 48 HOURS.  IF LANE
WEAKENS FASTER THAN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS INDICATING...THEN THE
REMNANT LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION WOULD BE STEERED MORE TOWARD THE WEST
BY THE SURFACE-BASED SUBTROPICAL RIDGE...SIMILAR TO THE UKMET
SOLUTION.

HURRICANE LANE WILL BE MOVING OVER PROGRESSIVELY COOLER WATER AND BY
48 HOURS BE OVER 20C SST WATER.  THE IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW PATTERN MAY
HELP TO OFFSET THE WEAKENING PROCESS EARLY IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...
BUT RAPID WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN AFTER 36 HOURS...IF NOT SOONER.
 
NOTE...SOME MID- AND MOSTLY HIGH-LEVEL MOISTURE FROM LANE IS
EXPECTED TO SPREAD OVER NORTHWESTERN MEXICO AND THE SOUTHWESTERN
U.S. OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

POSSIBLY MAKE A TURN MORE TOWARD THE NORTH AROUND THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S.  HOWEVER...
A TURN TO THE NORTH WILL BE DETERMINED BY HOW DEEP THE CIRCULATION

SPREADING OVER PORTIONS OF CALIFORNIA...NEVADA...AND OREGON.

THE CYCLONE IS NEARING 20 DEGREE CELSIUS WATERS.  OVER THESE COOL
WATERS...WITH THE ASSOCIATED STABLE LAPSE RATES IN THE LOWER
TROPOSPHERE...IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR STRONG WINDS ABOVE THE
BOUNDARY LAYER TO BE MIXED TO THE SURFACE UNLESS NEW CONVECTION
DEVELOPS NEAR THE CENTER.  LANE IS MAINTAINED AS A TROPICAL STORM ON
THIS PACKAGE BUT IT SHOULD SOON WEAKEN TO A DEPRESSION...AND BE
DISSIPATING AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE IN 24 HOURS.  THE REMNANT LOW WILL
BE NEARING THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

THE HEADING IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE NORTHWARD...350/11.  BECAUSE OF
THE CURRENT MOTION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS BEEN SHIFTED A
LITTLE FARTHER TO THE EAST.  THIS IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE SHALLOW-
LAYER BAM TRACK.

CONVECTION HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY IN THE DISTURBANCE OFF
THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF MEXICO. SHORT BANDED FEATURES CLEARLY DEFINE
THE CENTER...AND TAFB AND SAB BOTH PROVIDED T-NUMBERS OF 2.0...30
KT...AT 18Z.  SHIP REPORTS THIS AFTERNOON INDICATE A CLOSED
CIRCULATION IS LIKELY PRESENT AT THE SURFACE.  THESE OBSERVATIONS
ARE USED IN UPGRADING THE DISTURBANCE TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION
FIFTEEN-E.

THE SYSTEM HAS MOVED STEADILY TOWARD THE NW TO NNW AT ABOUT 10 KT
OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A MID- TO UPPER-
LEVEL VORTEX CENTERED NEAR LOS MOCHIS.  THE MODELS SUGGEST THIS
FEATURE WILL BE CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE TRACK.  THE GFDL...NOGAPS...
AND AVN HAVE SIMILAR...FASCINATING...EVOLUTIONS. THEY APPEAR TO
SPLIT THE LOW IN THE VERTICAL WITH THE 500 MB COMPONENT MOVING
TOWARD THE WEST TO WSW...AND THE 200 MB PART OPENING UP AND MOVING
SLOWLY TO THE NORTH.  TRACK MODELS SHOW THE DEPRESSION WRAPPING
AROUND THE EAST SIDE OF THE MID-LEVEL PORTION...TO THE SOUTH OF A
STRONG HIGH OFF CALIFORNIA.  THE MODEL TRACKS HEAD NNW-NW AT
FIRST...THEN BEND TOWARD THE WNW BY THE END OF THE 72 HOURS.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE. 

THE UPPER LOW IS ENHANCING OUTFLOW TO THE NORTHEAST.  WITH WARM
WATER ALONG THE TRACK FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  THE DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO BE A
TROPICAL STORM WHEN IT NEARS THE SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA
PENINSULA...AND THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO HAS ISSUED A TROPICAL STORM
WARNING FOR THE PENINSULA SOUTH OF 24N LATITUDE.

DURING THE DIURNAL MINIMUM...WITH AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM NOW
DEVELOPING SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS
30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY IN AGREEMENT WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES.

THE CENTER MAY BE A LITTLE EAST OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...AND
THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 335/10.  THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE 
SYNOPTIC REASONING OR THE MODEL GUIDANCE FROM THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE EAST
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT TRICKY AND VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON
THE TRACK.  AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS CURRENTLY OVER THE
DEPRESSION.  HOWEVER...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IS NORTHWEST OF THE
CYCLONE...AND LARGE SCALE MODELS SUGGEST UPPER LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY

TRACK OVER THE COLD WATER WEST OF BAJA...THE WARM WATER OF THE GULF

CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH TROPICAL DEPRESSION 15-E HAS INCREASED
SOME OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...BUT IT IS POORLY ORGANIZED.  WHILE

WINDS REMAIN AT 30 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.  THE SHIP ALSO SUGGESTS THE
CENTER IS FURTHER SOUTH THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT...THUS CAUSING A
RARE NIGHTTIME RE-LOCATION.

THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MOTION IS 335/8.  A MID/LEVEL RIDGE OVER
THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. SHOULD KEEP THE CYCLONE ON A GENERAL NORTHWEST

TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  SOME MORE INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST

THE FORWARD SPEED HAS SLOWED SOMEWHAT.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
FORECASTS THE MID/UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE NEAR CENTRAL BAJA TO MOVE
WESTWARD.  THIS CHANGE IN STEERING SHOULD CAUSE THE HEADING OF

8 PM PDT TUE SEP 19 2000
 
THE STRONG TROPICAL DISTURBANCE LOCATED SOUTH OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME ORGANIZED THIS EVENING AND HAS DEVELOPED
INTO TROPICAL SIXTEEN-E.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS BASED ON
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 30 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB.  OUTFLOW
HAS IMPROVED AND IS MORE CIRCULAR...AND THE CENTRAL DEEP CONVECTION
HAS INCREASED WITH A LARGE AREA OF VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS OF -85C TO 
-88C ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE SYSTEM CENTER.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS A SLOW DRIFT TO THE NORTH AT 2 KT. 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION 16-E IS EXPECTED TO ONLY DRIFT SLOWLY NORTHWARD
SINCE THE SYSTEM IS EMBEDDED IN A WEAK STEERING FLOW PATTERN.
HOWEVER...BY 24 HOURS...THE MID-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE EAST
IS EXPECTED TO SLOWLY BUILD WESTWARD AS THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE IN
THE GULF OF MEXICO GRADUALLY MOVES NORTHWARD.  ALL OF THE GLOBAL
MODELS AGREE ON SOME WEAK RIDGING TO OCCUR NORTH OF THE
DEPRESSION...WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE FORWARD SPEED LOW AND ALSO
POSSIBLY KEEP THE CYCLONE JUST OFFSHORE THE WEST COAST OF MEXICO.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION 16-E IS FORECAST TO STEADILY INTENSIFY THROUGH
24 HOURS UNTIL THE SYSTEM BEGINS TO ENCOUNTER SOME LAND INTERACTION
WITH THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST MEXICO WHICH MAY ACT TO DISRUPT THE
INFLOW FROM THE NORTHEAST AND EAST.  HOWEVER...THE WATER IS
SUFFICIENTLY WARM...ABOVE 29C...FOR INTENSIFICATION AND THE SHIPS
INTENSITY MODEL BRINGS THE CYCLONE TO CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE INTENSITY
IN 72 HOURS.  GIVEN THE RELATIVELY LOW VERTICAL SHEAR AND THE VERY
COLD CLOUD TOPS CURRENTLY BEING OBSERVED...IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS
SYSTEM COULD INTENSIFY FASTER AND ALSO BE STRONGER THAN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS INDICATING.  OBVIOUSLY...THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS
HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE SYSTEM REMAINING OVER WATER THROUGHOUT THE

LEVEL WINDS ARE FAVORABLE FOR SOME STRENGTHENING BEFORE THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE BEGINS TO INTERACT WITH THE HIGH TERRAIN.   

THE INITIAL MOTION APPEARS TO BE NORTHWARD ABOUT 2 KNOTS BUT BECAUSE
THE STEERING CURRENTS ARE WEAK...THE SYSTEM COULD MOVE ERRATICALLY
FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  THE SYSTEM OVERALL IS FORECAST TO MOVE
VERY NEAR OR OVER THE COAST OF SOUTHWEST MEXICO DURING THE NEXT 2 OR
3 DAYS.  THE SLOW MOTION COULD RESULT IN TORRENTIAL RAINS..LIFE-
THREATENING FLASH FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES.

SIXTEEN-E HAS BECOME TROPICAL STORM NORMAN.  THIS IS IN AGREEMENT
WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 35 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB.  

THE SHIP REPORT INDICATES NORMAN IS A LITTLE FURTHER NORTHEAST THAN
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT...AND THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MOTION IS 025/6. 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A MID/UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER
CENTRAL MEXICO THAT SHOULD EVENTUALLY TURN THE STORM ON A NORTHWEST
TRACK.  HOWEVER...ANY CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT MOTION WOULD BRING
THE CENTER INLAND.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK MOVES NORMAN INLAND
AND GRADUALLY CURVES IT NORTHWESTWARD AS IT DISSIPATES.  IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT NORMAN COULD TURN MORE SHARPLY AND EMERGE OVER THE
PACIFIC BEFORE IT DISSIPATES.

NORMAN SHOWS CLOUD TOPS TO -83C...AND SOME FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS
POSSIBLE BEFORE LANDFALL.  THE CYCLONE SHOULD WEAKEN AFTER
LANDFALL...WITH DISSIPATION IN 36 TO 48 HR.  HOWEVER...IF THE
NORTHWESTWARD TURN OCCURS EARLY ENOUGH TO KEEP THE STORM NEAR OR
OVER WATER...IT COULD STAY ALIVE FOR LONGER THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.

WITH THE SLOW MOTION OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF MEXICO...COULD RESULT IN

EVEN WITH RAPID-SCAN VISIBLE IMAGERY...THE CENTER OF NORMAN IS HARD

MOVING 360/2 AND IS NEAR THE MEXICAN COAST.  SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE 45 KT...45 KT...AND 35 KT FROM TAFB...AFWA...AND SAB. 
THUS THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 40 KT.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW A MID/UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE
OVER CENTRAL MEXICO...AND TRACK GUIDANCE RESPONDS TO THIS BY
SUGGESTING SOME KIND OF WESTWARD TURN.  THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER
THIS WILL HAPPEN BEFORE THE STORM GETS FAR ENOUGH INLAND TO
DISSIPATE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT
NORMAN WILL CONTINUE ENOUGH OF A NORTHWARD COMPONENT TO DISSIPATE
OVER LAND. 

NORMAN CONTINUES TO GENERATE COLD CONVECTION...AND IF THE CENTER
WERE NOT NEAR THE COAST IT WOULD PROBABLY STRENGTHEN.  WITH THE
FORECAST TRACK INTO THE MEXICAN MOUNTAINS...NORMAN IS EXPECTED TO
DISSIPATE BY 48 HR.  HOWEVER...IF THE CYCLONE EMERGES BACK OVER THE
PACIFIC...ALL BETS ARE OFF ON THE INTENSITY FORECAST.

EVEN THOUGH TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE DISCONTINUED...THE THREAT OF
MAJOR FLOODING FROM EXTREMELY HEAVY RAINS CONTINUES.  WHILE IT IS

A DAY OR SO...THE CIRCULATION WILL PROBABLY BE SO DISRUPTED BY THE
MEXICAN TERRAIN BY THAT TIME THAT A COMEBACK IS NOT LIKELY. 
HOWEVER...IF THE CENTER MOVES BACK OVER THE WATER SOONER THAN
EXPECTED...THE SYSTEM COULD REGENERATE.  

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS A NORTHWESTWARD DRIFT...310/4.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS ADUSTED TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ONE
BASED ON THE LATEST OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE...WHICH SHOWS A MORE WESTWARD

INTERACTION...IT IS UNLIKELY THAT NORMAN WOULD STRENGTHEN TO MUCH

TROPIAL DEPRESSION NORMAN REMAINS POORLY ORGANIZED OTHER THAN A
LARGE CONVECTIVE COMPLEX NORTH OF THE SYSTEM CENTER AND ALSO INLAND
ALONG THE WEST COAST OF MEXICO. THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF 30 KT IS
BASED ON A 22/0105Z QUIKSCAT PASS SHOWING WESTERLY RAIN-CONTAMINATED
WINDS OF 35 TO  40 KT SOUTH OF THE CENTER...WHICH EQUATES TO ABOUT
30 TO 32 KT CORRECTED SURFACE WINDS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 325/09.  TROPICAL DEPRESSION NORMAN
IS FORECAST TO REMAIN OVER WATER FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND THEN
GRADUALLY TURN NORTH AND NORTHEAST AND MOVE INLAND BY 36 HOURS. THIS
SCENARIO IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THE AVAILABLE MODEL GUIDANCE...
EXCEPT THAT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SLOWER DUE TO EXPECTED
INTERACTION WITH THE HIGH MOUNTIANOUS TERRAIN OF NORTHWEST MEXICO.
 
LAND INTERACTION SHOULD INHIBIT ANY SIGNIFICANT RE-INTENSIFICATION
BEFORE MAKING LANDFALL.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NORMAN COULD BRIEFLY
REACH MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH JUST BEFORE MAKING LANDFALL...
BUT THESE WINDS WOULD LIKELY BE SHORT-LIVED AND MAINLY IN SQUALLS
NORTH OF THE CENTER...WHICH WOULD BE AN OFFSHORE FLOW PATTERN.
 
HOWEVER...NORMAN WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT HEAVY RAINFALL
ALONG THE WEST COAST OF MEXICO...AND THE THREAT OF FLOODING FROM
POSSIBLE RAINFALL TOTALS OF 5 TO 10 INCHES OR MORE WILL CONTINUE
MAINLY FROM PUERTO VALLARTA NORTH TO LOS MOCHIS MEXICO.

VISIBLE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE STORM IS SLIGHTLY BETTER ORGANIZED
THIS MORNING...WITH A BANDING FEATURE OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE. 
INITIAL INTENSITY IS BUMPED UP TO 40 KNOTS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH
A RECENT QUIKSCAT PASS OVER THE AREA.  NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR CONTINUES
TO AFFECT OLIVIA...SO ONLY SLOW STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE LATEST SHIPS GUIDANCE.
 
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE MOTION OVERNIGHT.  LATEST GLOBAL MODEL
GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A RIDGE WILL REMAIN TO THE NORTH OF OLIVIA FOR THE
NEXT 72 HOURS.  THEREFORE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A SLOW WEST TO
WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH THE PERIOD.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE

AN SSM/I OVERPASS AT 1523Z SUGGESTED A FORMATIVE EYE...AND IT TRIED
TO BRIEFLY APPEAR IN VISIBLE IMAGERY JUST BEFORE SUNDOWN.  THESE
SUGGEST THAT OLIVIA CONTINUES TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 55 KT...55 KT...AND 45 KT FROM TAFB...SAB...

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WITH
MULTIPLE SHORTWAVES NORTH OF 20N WEST OF 115W...AND WEAK RIDGING
JUST NORTH OF OLIVIA.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THE RIDGE WILL
BUILD WESTWARD WITH TIME...WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE A GENERAL WEST TO
WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.  NHC TRACK
GUIDANCE GENERALLY AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO...ALTHOUGH THERE IS
SOME SPREAD IN THE FORECAST FORWARD SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR A SLOWER MOTION...IN AGREEMENT WITH THE
CURRENT MOTION OF 280/4...THE NOGAPS...AND THE UKMET.

ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL SOME EASTERLY SHEAR...OLIVIA SHOULD CONTINUE
TO STRENGTHEN FOR THE NEXT 24 HR OR SO AS IT HAS DONE TODAY.  AFTER
THAT...THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT EASTERLY SHEAR WILL INCREASE AND
EITHER STOP INTENSIFICATION OF PERHAPS WEAKEN THE STORM.  THE
INTENSITY FORECAST WILL LEVEL OFF THE INTENSIFICATION AFTER 36 HR. 
IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE NOGAPS FORECAST LESS SHEAR THAN THE AVN...

IR IMAGERY INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THE FORMATIVE EYE OBSERVED
EARLIER IS NO LONGER APPARENT BUT THERE ARE STRONG CONVECTIVE CELLS
TO THE EAST AND NORTHWEST OF THE CENTER.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD
AT 55 KNOTS AT THIS TIME.  ALTHOUGH THE EASTERLY SHEAR MAY
INCREASE...THE WATER IS WARM SO...A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING IS
INDICATED DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  HOWEVER...NONE OF INTENSITY
MODELS BRING THE WINDS UP TO 80 KNOTS AS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST BUT I PREFER NOT TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AT T HIS

OLIVIA IS MOVING 285/07...A LITTLE BIT FASTER.  THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
IS LOCATED SOUTH OF STRONG MID-LEVEL RIDGE WHICH IS FORECAST TO
REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY AND BUILD WESTWARD.  THIS PATTERN WOULD
FAVOR A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS. IN

EASTERLY SHEAR HAS DISRUPTED THE SYSTEM SOMEWHAT...AND HALTED THE
DEVELOPMENT TREND THAT WAS NOTED EARLIER.  THERE ARE STILL SOME
BANDING FEATURES OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  HOWEVER THE SYSTEM IS
NOT ANY BETTER ORGANIZED THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON...AND
PERHAPS LESS SO.  BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THE STORM...AND
FOLLOWING THE SHIPS GUIDANCE...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS
ADJUSTED DOWNWARD.

MORNING VISUAL IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER IS NOT AS FAR WEST
AS EARLIER ESTIMATED.  INITIAL MOTION IS REDUCED TO 290/5.  EVEN
THOUGH THE GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE MID-LEVEL RIDGING TO
THE NORTH OF OLIVIA...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE RIDGE IS
RATHER WEAK.  ONLY A SLOW WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION IS FORECAST. 
THIS IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...MAINLY DUE TO

OF COLD CLOUD TOPS TONIGHT COMPARED TO 24 HOURS AGO.  LIKEWISE THE
INITIAL INTENSITY ESTIMATE HAS ALSO DECREASED BY 10 KNOTS.  THE SAME

STRONG POSSIBILITY... THE SHIPS GUIDANCE WANTS TO SLOWLY INCREASE
THE INTENSITY TO 60 KNOTS IN 72 HOURS.  CURRENT DVORAK ESTIMATES

A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION HAS REAPPEARED OVER THE CENTER AND THE
WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 45 KNOTS.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL
INDICATES A SLIGHT EASING OF VERTICAL SHEAR WHICH IS PROBABLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTENSIFICATION.  THE FORECAST IS FOR LITTLE
CHANGE THROUGH 72 HOURS AS OLIVIA CONTINUES MOVING OVER WARM WATER.

THERE ARE NO IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE TRACK FORECAST PHILOSOPHY...
WITH THE MOTION BEING INFLUENCED BY A RIDGE TO THE NORTHEAST OVER
MEXICO AND A TROUGH TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE MOTION IS EXPECTED TO
GRADUALLY TURN TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS.

OLIVIA IS A TENACIOUS TROPICAL CYCLONE.  CONVECTION KEEPS
REDEVELOPING AND THE CENTER IS NOW EMBEDDED WITHIN A VERY STRONG
CLUSTER OF DEEP CONVECTION...SUGGESTING THAT THE WIND SHEAR HAS
RELAXED. IN FACT...THE COULD PATTERN IS MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED AND
THE SYSTEM IS STRONGER THAT 24 HOURS AGO. SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT WINDS ARE ABOUT 50 KNOTS AND BECAUSE THE
SHEAR IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN LIGHT...SOME STRENGTHENING MAY OCCUR
BEFORE OLIVIA BEGINS TO APPROACH COOLER WATERS IN TWO OR THREE DAYS.

OLIVIA IS MOVING TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST ABOUT 7 KNOTS AROUND THE
PERIPHERY OF A PERSISTENT MID-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN
UNITED STATES.  GLOBAL MODELS FORECAST THAT THIS RIDGE WILL WEAKEN
BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD AS A NEW TROUGH APPROACHES FROM
THE PACIFIC.  OLIVIA MAY THEN TURN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST.

OLIVIA IS UNDERGOING STRONG SHEAR FROM THE EAST AND NORTHEAST...AND
THE CENTER IS PARTLY EXPOSED ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE IN VISIBLE AND
INFRARED IMAGERY AND MOSTLY EXPOSED IN SSMI AND TRMM MICROWAVE DATA.
THE EARLIER CCC...CENTRAL COLD COVER PATTERN... HAS DISSIPATED...
ALTHOUGH THE MID-LEVEL CIRCULATION REMAINS QUITE IMPRESSIVE. 
OUTFLOW IS GOOD IN THE SOUTHWEST SEMICIRCLE AND POOR TO RESTRICTED
ELSEWHERE.  BOTH TAFB AND SAB GAVE A SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF
55 KT AT 00Z...BUT THE INITIAL INTENSITY WAS DECREASED TO 50 KT
BASED ON THE RAGGED APPEARANCE IN INFRARED IMAGERY AND THE EXPOSED
LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION SEEN IN MICROWAVE DATA.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/08.  THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER WAS
RELOCATED FURTHER NORTH DUE TO THE VERTICAL SHEAR.  HOWEVER...THE
GENERAL NORTHWEST DIRECTION AND SPEED HAS NOT CHANGED.  ALMOST ALL
OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE NOW AGREE ON OLIVIA GRADUALLY RECURVING TO THE
NORTHEAST BY 48 HOURS AROUND THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AXIS THAT CURRENTLY LIES ALONG 22N LATITUDE.  THE
RECURVATURE SCENARIO APPEARS REASONABLE GIVEN THE APPROACHING MID-
LEVEL TROUGH ALONG 125W LONGITUDE AS SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK
AND CLOSE TO THE GFDL...UKMET...AND GUNS MODELS.

LOW-LEVEL COLD AIR STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS ARE ADVECTING INTO THE
NORTHWEST QUADRANT OF OLIVIA.  THE COMBINATION OF THE COOLER AIR 
AND EASTERLY SHEAR SHOULD CONTINUE TO WEAKEN THE SYSTEM EVEN MORE. 
HOWEVER...OLIVIA HAS HAD A HISTORY OF MAKING A STRONG COMEBACK AT
NIGHT AND SSTS ARE STILL AROUND 28 CELSIUS.  THEREFORE...ONLY 
MINOR WEAKENING IS FORECAST THROUGH 24 HOURS...WITH SLIGHT 
RE-INTENSIFICATION AFTERWARDS SINCE OLIVIA WILL BE UNDER THE MEAN
200 MB RIDGE AXIS...WHICH SHOULD LESSEN THE VERTICAL SHEAR.  BUT BY
72 HOURS...THE SHEAR WILL INCREASE AGAIN...EXCEPT FROM THE WEST AS
THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES.

A TRMM OVERPASS AT 0221Z...COURTESY OF THE NRL WEB PAGE...SHOWS THAT
OLIVIA REMAINS IN A STRONGLY SHEARED STATE.  CONVECTION HAS BEEN
VIGOROUS...BUT IS ABOUT 60 NM TO THE WEST OF THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION CENTER.  SATELLITE DVORAK CI NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB
GIVE 65 AND 55 KT RESPECTIVELY.  EVEN THE T NUMBER INTENSITIES...55
AND 45 KT...ARE OVERLY GENEROUS IF THE TRMM POSITION IS CORRECT. 
THE ADVISORY INTENSITY IS LOWERED TO 45 KT AND IS PROBABLY HIGH.  A
RECENT QUIKSCAT PASS CAUGHT THE EAST SIDE AND SHOWED NOTHING ABOVE
ABOUT 30 KT.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/09.  GLOBAL MODELS SHOW A BREAK
IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE JUST AHEAD OF OLIVIA...AND WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SHOWS A SLOW-MOVING MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL SHORT-WAVE TROUGH
NEAR 28N124W.  THESE FEATURES SHOULD TURN OLIVIA TO THE NORTH IN 24-
36 HOURS.  AFTER THAT...A MAJOR TROUGH IS FORECAST BY BOTH THE AVN
AND UKMET TO DIG DOWN AND ACCELERATE OLIVIA NORTHEASTWARD.  MODEL
GUIDANCE IS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF
ACCELERATION IS IN QUESTION.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A LITTLE
FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS CLOSE TO THE UKMET AND
GFDL.

ALTHOUGH THE SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE FORECASTS A GRADUAL
WEAKENING...THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR
OLIVIA TO STRENGTHEN IN ABOUT 24-36 HOURS AS IT MOVES UNDER THE 200
MB RIDGE AXIS WHEN THERE SHOULD BE A REDUCTION IN THE STRONG
EASTERLY SHEAR.  SHOULD THIS OCCUR...THEN OLIVIA COULD HOLD TOGETHER
AS A TROPICAL STORM UNTIL IT REACHES THE BAJA PENINSULA.

OLIVIA IS DEVOID OF AN DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE FULLY EXPOSED LOW-
LEVEL CENTER...ALTHOUGH A FEW WEAK CONVECTIVE BANDS HAVE REDEVELOPED
ON THE SOUTH SIDE DURING THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS.  SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND KGWC YIELD 30 KT WITH 25 KT COMING
IN FROM SAB...SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 30 KT.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 310/9.  ALL OF THE MODELS AGREE ON GRADUAL
RECURVATURE TO THE NORTHEAST IN ABOUT 24 TO 36 HOURS...EXCEPT FOR
CLIPER WHICH KEEPS OLIVIA TRACKING TO THE NORTHWEST.  HOWEVER...THE
STRONG SURFACE RIDGE TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST SHOULD PREVENT ANY
SIGNIFICANT NORTHWEST MOTION.  THE MAIN QUESTION IS HOW DEEP WILL
THE REMNANT CIRCULATION OF OLIVIA BE IN 24 HOURS.  THE DEEP LAYER
STEERING FLOW SUGGESTS RECURVATURE...BUT A SHALLOW SYSTEM WOULD MOST
LIKELY TAKE A SLOWER NORTHWEST TRACK...STALL...AND THEN DISSIPATE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS TRACK AND RECURVES
OLIVIA TO THE NORTHEAST IN THE MIDDLE OF MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE.
 
WATER VAPOR AND INFRARED IMAGERY SUGGEST THAT THE EASTERLY VERTICAL
SHEAR IS DECREASING AS OLIVIA MOVES POLEWARD BENEATH A 200 MB RIDGE
AXIS.  THIS PATTERN WOULD GENERALLY FAVOR INTENSIFICATION...EXCEPT
THAT THE CYCLONE IS MOVING OVER COOL WATER WITH SSTS BELOW 26C. 
THERE ARE ALSO COLD AIR STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS BEGINNING TO WRAP INTO
THE WESTERN HALF OF THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION.  HOWEVER...THERE IS
STILL ENOUGH WARM UNSTABLE AIR TO THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH THAT COULD
PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY FOR ONE FINAL BURST OF CONVECTION TONIGHT
DURING THE DIURNAL CONVECTIVE MAXIMUM PERIOD.  FOR THAT REASON...I
AM A LITTLE HESITANT TO DISSIPATE OLIVIA IN 24 TO 36 HOURS. 
HOWEVER...IF CONVECTION DOES NOT REDEVELOP TONIGHT...THEN THE SYSTEM
WILL LIKELY SPIN DOWN AND DISSIPATE BY TOMORROW...IF NOT SOONER. 
THE SHIPS MODEL DISSIPATES OLIVIA BY 36 HOURS.

NOTE...12 FT SEAS RADII WERE ADDED TO THE MARINE/FORECAST ADVISORY
BASED ON A 14 FT REPORT AT 09/12Z FROM SHIP VRVS5 TO THE SOUTHWEST.

SOME MODERATE CONVECTION HAS REDEVELOPED NEAR THE CENTER IN A LONG
CURVED BAND ON THE SOUTH SIDE.  OTHER SMALL CONVECTIVE ELEMENTS HAVE
ALSO FILLED IN AROUND THE REST OF THE CIRCULATION...SO I HAVE OPTED
TO MAINTAIN THE INTENSITY AT 30 KT IN CASE THE CONVECTION DECIDES TO
COME BACK LATER THIS EVENING.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 315/6.  THE FORWARD SPEED OF OLIVIA HAS
DECREASED DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS.  THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE LACK OF
DEEP CONVECTION TO MAINTAIN A DEEP VERTICAL CIRCULATION.  AS
MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...THE STRONG SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE TO THE RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH SHOULD IMPEDE ANY
SIGNIFICANT NORTHWESTWARD MOTION.  THE KEY TO THE FORECAST REMAINS
WHETHER OR NOT OLIVIA DEVELOPS ANY MORE DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER...WHICH WOULD CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO BE STEERED NORTH AND THEN
NORTHEAST BY THE DEEP LAYER FLOW THAT THE GLOBAL MODELS ARE
FORECASTING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS THE EARLIER
RECURVATURE SCENARIO...WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF THE MODEL
GUIDANCE.  HOWEVER...IF DEEP CONVECTION DOES NOT REDEVELOP IN THE
NEXT 12 HOURS...THEN OLIVIA WILL TAKE SLOW NORTHWEST TRACK AND
QUICKLY DISSIPATE.
 
THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECAST REASONING. 
OLIVIA HAS BEEN TRYING TO DEVELOP NEW CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER THE
PAST 4 TO 6 HOURS.  IF THIS TREND PERSISTS...THEN OLIVIA COULD
REMAIN A TROPICAL DEPRESSION THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND
POSSIBLY BEYOND THAT.  HOWEVER...IF THE CURRENT MODERATE CONVECTION
WEAKENS...THEN OLIVIA WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE IN 24 HOURS.

AN EARLIER BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN QUADRANT
OF THE CYCLONE HAS SUBSIDED.  AT THE MOMENT OLIVIA IS VOID OF
DEEP CONVECTION...BUT THERE MAY BE SOME REGENERATION DURING THE
TYPICAL DIURNAL MAXIMUM PERIOD LATER TONIGHT.  AT 00Z...THE SYSTEM
WAS STILL CLASSIFIABLE BY THE DVORAK TECHNIQUE AND CURRENT INTENSITY
IS HELD AT 25 KNOTS.  VERTICAL SHEAR HAS WEAKENED...BUT NOW OLIVIA
IS MOVING OVER SOMEWHAT COOLER WATERS AND INTO A MORE STABLE
ATMOSPHERE.  BARRING A MAJOR COMEBACK...THE SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY BE
DECLARED DISSIPATED IN 24 HOURS...OR SOONER.

A SLOW NORTHWESTWARD MOTION CONTINUES...315/06.  THE DISSIPATING
CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO TURN NORTHWARD AND NORTHEASTWARD IN RESPONSE
TO A LOW-LEVEL TROUGH TO ITS NORTH.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS A LITTLE TO THE WEST OF THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS A

IN HINDSIGHT...IT APPEARS THAT THE DISTURBANCE SOUTHWEST OF
MANZANILLO WAS PROBABLY A TROPICAL STORM OVERNIGHT.  THIS MORNING A
TIGHT LOW-LEVEL CLOUD SWIRL EMERGED AND HAS BEEN GRADUALLY
SEPARATING FROM THE DEEP CONVECTION EVER SINCE.  THE CIRCULATION
DOES HAVE AMPLE BANDS OF SHALLOW CONVECTION...ENOUGH TO QUALIFY AS A
TROPICAL CYCLONE.  A QUIKSCAT PASS AROUND 13Z THIS MORNING SUGGESTED
THAT WINDS THEN WERE IN THE 35-40 KT RANGE.  NOW...WITH THE EXPOSED
CENTER...THE WINDS HAVE PRESUMABLY COME DOWN A BIT.   SHEAR IS
EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGH FOR THE NEXT DAY OR SO BUT WILL CHANGE
ORIENTATION FROM WESTERLY TO NORTHERLY.  AFTER THAT...THERE MAY BE
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME STRENGTHENING. 

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/14.  THE DEPRESSION IS LOCATED SOUTH OF A
LOW- TO MID-LEVEL RIDGE THAT IS PROVIDING A BASIC WESTWARD STEERING
FLOW.  UPSTREAM OF THIS RIDGE IS A LARGE CUTOFF LOW NEAR 40N127W. 
GLOBAL MODELS ARE FORECASTING AMPLIFICATION OF A TROUGH OUT OF THIS
CUTOFF THAT WEAKENS THE RIDGE AND COULD RESULT IN A SLOWING OF THE
FORWARD MOTION OVER THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  A COMPLICATING FACTOR WILL
BE HOW LONG THE CYCLONE REMAINS IN A SHEARED STATE AND FOLLOWS A
SHALLOWER LAYER FLOW.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FAVORS THE NOGAPS
SOLUTION...WHICH KEEPS A MUCH WEAKER SYSTEM THAN THE AVN...AND
CONSEQUENTLY TAKES THE DEPRESSION FARTHER TO THE WEST.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION EIGHTEEN-E CONTINUES AS A TIGHTLY WOUND LOW
LEVEL CENTER WITH NORTHERLY UPPER LEVEL WINDS DISPLACING THE MAIN
CONVECTION WELL TO THE SOUTHEAST.  A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE
DEVELOPING NEAR THE CENTER...BUT ARE HAVING TROUBLE PERSISTING.  THE
MAXIMUM WINDS REMAIN 30 KT IN AGREEMENT WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES.

THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 275/14.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A
LARGE DEEP-LAYER TROUGH ALONG THE U.S. WEST COAST...WITH A RIDGE
BETWEEN THAT FEATURE AND THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS
INDICATE THE TROUGH WILL DIG SOUTHEASTWARD AND WEAKEN THE RIDGE BY
48 HR.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW THE DEPRESSION TO GRADUALLY TURN TO THE
WEST-NORTHWEST.  AFTER 48 HR...THE TROUGH WILL STOP DIGGING AND MOVE
FARTHER AWAY FROM THE DEPRESSION...WITH THE WEAK RIDGE IN BETWEEN
MOVING THE CYCLONE GENERALLY TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...CALLING
FOR A GRADUAL WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TURN AND DECELERATION TO 7 KT BY 36
HR.  THIS IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE MORE NORTHERLY AVN AND BAM
MODELS AND THE MORE SOUTHERLY NOGAPS AND STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL
MODELS.
 
THE CURRENT UPPER LEVEL WINDS AND LACK OF CENTRAL CONVECTION DO NOT
FAVOR STRENGTHENING.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS SUGGEST THE SHEAR SHOULD
DECREASE SOME BY 24 TO 36 HR...WHICH COULD ALLOW SOME STRENGTHENING
IF THE CYCLONE REDEVELOPS CENTRAL CONVECTION BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL ASSUME THAT IT CAN...AND WILL CONTINUE
TO SHOW MODEST STRENGTHENING AFTER 24 HR.  IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE
SHIPS AND GFDL MODELS INDICATE MORE DEVELOPMENT THAN CURRENTLY
FORECAST.

SOME DEEP CONVECTION HAS BEEN REDEVELOPING NEAR AND OVER THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER...BUT THE SYSTEM REMAINS SHEARED.  THERE IS LITTLE
OR NO EVIDENCE OF BANDING FEATURES.  DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS ARE T2.0
SO THE MAXIMUM WIND ESTIMATE REMAINS 30 KNOTS.  SINCE THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE IS NOT WELL ORGANIZED AND IS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF NORTHERLY
TO NORTHWESTERLY SHEAR...LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED
TODAY.  IN A DAY OR SO...THE SHEAR MAY RELAX JUST A LITTLE...SO SOME
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR BY THAT TIME.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY
FORECAST IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE LATEST SHIPS MODEL RUN.

THE CENTER WOBBLED A LITTLE TO THE SOUTH OF WEST BUT NOW APPEARS TO
BE MOVING ESSENTIALLY WESTWARD AT A SLIGHTLY SLOWER SPEED THAN
BEFORE.  A LARGE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE NEAR THE CALIFORNIA
COAST HAS A TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWARD TO NEAR 30N LATITUDE.  THE

SOUTH...TO NEAR 20N...AND BREAK DOWN THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE

THE EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION...WHICH HAS BEEN FAIRLY PERSISTENT
AND COLD OVER THE PAST TWELVE HOURS.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 35 KT...AND SO THE DEPRESSION IS UPGRADED TO

SYSTEM MAY LESSEN OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO AND ALLOW SOME
STRENGTHENING.  IF PAUL REMAINS SOUTH OF THE FORECAST TRACK IT WOULD
AVOID AN INCREASE IN SHEAR LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD AND COULD
STRENGTHEN FASTER THAN INDICATED HERE.

THE MOTION OVER THE PAST TWELVE HOURS WAS STILL A LITTLE SOUTH OF
WEST...BUT A LITTLE SLOWER THAN BEFORE.  A LARGE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
CYCLONE NEAR THE CALIFORNIA COAST HAS A TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWARD

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A GRADUAL TURN TO THE RIGHT WITH FURTHER
SLOWING OF FORWARD SPEED.  THE PERSISTENCE OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR

MOST CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH PAUL HAS DISSIPATED OVER THE PAST
FEW HOURS...WITH ONLY ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS SOUTHEAST OF THE
CENTER.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 45
KT...BUT WITH THE CURRENT LACK OF CONVECTION THE MAXIMUM WINDS WILL
REMAIN 35 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.

LAST LIGHT VISIBLE IMAGERY SUGGEST THE CENTER IS MOVING A LITTLE
SLOWER AND MORE TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST.  THE MOTION FOR THIS ADVISORY
IS A MORE CONSERVATIVE 275/12...BUT THE LONG-AWAITED WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION MAY BE STARTING.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES
CENTERED OVER CALIFORNIA EXTENDING SOUTHWARD TO ABOUT 23N...WITH
RIDGING BETWEEN IT AND PAUL.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS INDICATE THIS
TROUGH SHOULD WEAKEN THE RIDGE FOR 24 TO 48 HR...WHICH WOULD SLOW
PAUL AND ALLOW IT TO MOVE WEST-NORTHWEST.  AFTER 48 HR...THE TROUGH
MOVES EASTWARD...WHICH ALLOWS THE RIDGE TO STRENGTHEN AND PAUL TO
TURN MORE WESTWARD.  NHC TRACK GUIDANCE IS IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT
WITH THIS SCENARIO THAN 6 HR AGO...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NEAR
THE CENTER OF THE GUIDANCE SUITE.  THE ONLY OUTLIERS ARE THE LBAR
(NORTHWEST) AND THE AIR FORCE MM5 (WEST TO WEST-SOUTHWEST).

PAUL HAD LITTLE CONVECTION AT THIS TIME YESTERDAY...FOLLOWED BY A
SIGNIFICANT FLARE-UP NEAR THE DIURNAL MAXIMUM.  IT IS LIKELY A
SIMILAR FLARE-UP WILL OCCUR IN 6 TO 12 HR.  THE AVN AND UKMET
FORECAST DECREASING SHEAR OVER PAUL.  HOWEVER...SATELLITE IMAGERY
SUGGESTS THOSE MODELS UNDERESTIMATE THE UPPER LEVEL WESTERLY FLOW
WEST OF THE STORM.  THE NOGAPS INITIALIZATION LOOKS BETTER...AND IT
FORECASTS A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.  BASED ON THAT...LESS
INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST THAN IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THERE IS
A CHANCE THAT THE WESTERLIES COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO WEAKEN OR

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/10 WITH GOOD CONFIDENCE USING THE

MODEL SHOWS A WEAK EAST/WEST RIDGE HOLDING JUST NORTH OF THE SYSTEM
AND THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS ABOUT THE SAME AS SIX HOURS AGO...SHOWING
A CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE FORECAST
TRACK IS QUITE SIMILAR TO AND AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS EXPOSED WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION DISPLACED

THE WIND SPEED AT 45 KNOTS...A QUIKSCAT PASS AT 0128Z SHOWED ALL

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 AM PDT FRI OCT 27 2000

TROPICAL STORM PAUL HAS REDEVELOPED CONVECTION NEAR THE SYSTEM
CENTER...ALTHOUGH THE BULK OF THE DEEP CONVECTION REMAINS SHEARED TO
THE EAST.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF 35 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/10.  PAUL HAS MADE A SLIGHT
POLEWARD JOG...BUT A GENERAL TURN BACK MORE TOWARD A 285 DEGREES
MOTION IS EXPECTED NOW THAT A SHORTWAVE TROUGH HAS PASSED TO THE
NORTH AND NORTHEAST.  THE WEAKENED SUBTROPICAL RIDGE SHOULD BUILD
BACK IN TO THE NORTH OF PAUL AND HELP TO TURN THE SYSTEM MORE
WESTWARD IN 12 TO 24 HOURS.  HOWEVER...WITH PAUL MOVING INTO UPPER-
LEVEL WESTERLY FLOW...A GRADUAL DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED IS
EXPECTED.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND
SIMILAR TO ALL OF THE AVAILABLE MODEL GUIDANCE...ONLY FARTHER TO THE
RIGHT OR MORE POLEWARD.

ALTHOUGH THE UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLY FLOW PATTERN HAS BECOME MORE
DIFFLUENT...WHICH HAS LIKELY AIDED THE REDEVELOPMENT OF DEEP
CONVECTION...THE MODERATE TO STRONG SHEAR PATTERN IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.  AS A RESULT...THERE SHOULD BE
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND DEPTH OF THE CONVECTION WITH
WEAKENING GENERALLY OCCURRING DURING THE DAY AND REDEVELOPMENT AT
NIGHT. HOWEVER...THE INTENSITY IS FORECAST TO REMAIN STEADY THROUGH
36 HOURS WITH ONLY SLIGHT STRENGTHENING AFTERWARDS WHEN THE SHEAR IS
FORECAST TO DECREASE A LITTLE.

TROPICAL STORM PAUL HAS HAS CHANGED LITTLE DURING THE PAST 6 HOURS
AND REMAINS IN A SHEARED ENVIRONMENT WITH MOST OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION DISPLACED TO THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER. THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF 35 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB...AND A 27/1411Z QUIKSCAT
OVERPASS SHOWING 30 TO 35 KT WINDS WHEN THE CONVECTION WAS WEAKER.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/11.  PAUL MAY HAVE BEGUN TO MAKE
THE TURN BACK TOWARD THE WEST SOONER THAN INDICATED IN THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST.  A SHEAR LINE/COLD FRONT AHEAD OF A SOUTHWARD BUILDING
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD COMBINE WITH THE BUILDING 
MID-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTHG AND KEEP PAUL MOVING ON A
WEST-NORTHWEST OR WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH THE PERIOD.  MOST OF THE
MODEL GUIDANCE IS NOW CLOSELY CLUSTERED AROUND THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACK...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS TRACK
ONLY SLIGHTLY FASTER...WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE UKMET...GUNS...
AND DEEP BAM MODELS.
 
THE STRONG UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLY FLOW REMAINS DIFFLUENT...WHICH IS
PROBABLY THE ONLY THING KEEPING PAUL ALIVE...BTU THE SHEAR PATTERN
IS EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AND PAUL COULD EASILY
WEAKEN INTO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION AT ANY TIME.  HOWEVER...THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR OR LITTLE OR NO STRENGTHENING
BASED ON CONTINUITY...THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL...AND THE IMPRESSIVE
LOW-LEVEL SOUTHERLY INFLOW PATTERN THAT HAS DEVELOPED DURING THE
DAY.  THE LATTER FEATURE MAY INCREASE THE LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND
DEEP CONVECTION LATER TONIGHT DURING THE DIURNAL MAXIMUM PERIOD
DESPITE THE STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR.

PAUL REMAINS STRONGLY SHEARED...WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS NEAR THE
CENTER AND A LARGER...BUT DISSIPATING...CONVECTIVE MASS FURTHER
EAST.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 35 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...
AND 30 KT FROM AFWA.  PAUL WILL REMAIN A TROPICAL STORM FOR AT LEAST
ONE MORE ADVISORY.

LAST LIGHT VISIBLE IMAGES SHOW A TURN TO THE LEFT.  THE INITIAL
MOTION FOR THIS ADVISORY IS 275/13...BUT THE SHORT TERM MOTION IS
CLOSER TO 270 AND FASTER.  SATELLITE IMAGERY AND LARGE-SCALE MODELS
INDICATE THAT PAUL AND THE DEEP TROUGH ALONG THE U.S. WEST COAST
HAVE BY-PASSED EACH OTHER...AND THAT LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGING NORTH AND
NORTHWEST OF PAUL IS BECOMING THE DOMINANT STEERING INFLUENCE.  THIS
SHOULD MOVE THE CYCLONE GENERALLY WESTWARD...WITH THE MAIN QUESTION
BEING WILL THE MOTION BE CLOSER TO 270 OR 285.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SHIFTED SOUTHWARD FROM THE PREVIOUS TRACK...WITH A 275
MOTION EARLY AND A 285 MOTION LATE.  THIS IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH
THE NOGAPS...AVN...AND GFDN.

PAUL REMAINS IN A RATHER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT...WITH SHEAR DATA FROM
THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SHOWING 15-25 KT OF WESTERLY SHEAR. 
THIS IS UNLIKELY TO LET UP FOR AT LEAST 24 HR.  THE INTENSITY
FORECAST WILL THUS WEAKEN PAUL TO A DEPRESSION AFTER THE NEXT
DIURNAL CONVECTIVE MAXIMUM.  LARGE-SCALE MODELS CONTINUE TO FORECAST
DECREASING WESTERLIES AFTER 24-36 HR...AND IN VIEW OF THIS THE
FORECAST WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW SLIGHT STRENGTHENING AFTER 36 HR. 
HOWEVER...THESE UPPER WINDS FORECASTS HAVE NOT VERIFIED POORLY FOR
THE PAST TWO DAYS...AND IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE WESTERLIES
WILL REMAIN STRONG ENOUGH TO DISSIPATE PAUL BEFORE 72 HR.

A RIDGE PERSISTING TO THE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM THROUGH 72 HOURS AND

TROPICAL DEPRESSION PAUL HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVERNIGHT WITH PERIODIC
BURSTS OF DEEP CONVECTION OCCURRING MAINLY IN THE SOUTHEAST
QUADRANT.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF 30 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.  ALTHOUGH THE UPPER-LEVEL
FLOW IS VERY DIFFLUENT...THE OUTFLOW PATTERN IS POOR OWING TO 
MODERATE TO STRONG WESTERLY SHEAR.  MICROWAVE SATELLITE DATA WAS
UNAVAILABLE FOR POSITIONING.
 
THE CENTER REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE IN INFRARED IMAGERY THIS
MORNING AND MAY POSSIBLY BE ELONGATED EAST-WEST.  THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/13 AND IS BASED PRIMARILY ON PERSISTENCE AND
CONTINUITY WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  ALL OF THE GLOBAL MODELS
MAINTAIN THE STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH...SO PAUL SHOULD
CONTINUE TO TRACK IN A GENERAL WESTWARD DIRECTION AS A STRAIGHT-
RUNNER.  THIS SCENARIO IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL
FORECASTS AND THE LATEST TIGHTLY-PACKED MODEL FORECAST GUIDANCE. 
NOTE...THE CENTER POSITION MAY HAVE TO BE RELOCATED ONCE VISIBLE
IMAGERY BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PAUL IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN AT LEAST A MODERATE SHEAR PATTERN FOR
THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  AFTERWARDS...THE AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS
TURN THE 200 MB WINDS AROUND TO A NORTHEAST OR EASTERLY DIRECTION...
WHICH WOULD FAVOR AT LEAST SOME SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IF PAUL REMAINS
SOUTH OF 15N LATITUDE.  IN CONTRAST...THE UKMET RETAINS SOME WEAK
SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
MAINTAINS PAUL AT MINIMUM DEPRESSION STRENGTH THROUGH THE
PERIOD...WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL FORECAST.  SOME
SLIGHT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INTENSITY WILL BE POSSIBLE AS
INTERMITTENT BURSTS OF CONVECTION DEVELOP AND THEN WEAKEN. 
HOWEVER...IF THE SHEAR SHARPLY DECREASES LIKE THE AVN AND NOGAPS
MODELS ARE FORECASTING...THEN PAUL WILL BE MUCH STRONGER THAN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST AND THE SHIPS MODEL ARE INDICATING.

DEPRESSION.  CONVECTION REMAINS SHEARED TO THE EAST AND SOUTH OF THE
CENTER.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS BASED ON A SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE OF BARELY 30 KT FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.
 
THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS BROAD AND ELONGATED EAST-WEST WHICH

OF AND VERY CLOSE TO THE CENTER...REPORTED A PRESSURE OF 1003 MB AND
WINDS OF 18 KT AT 00Z.  ALTHOUGH DVORAK NUMBERS STILL GIVE 25
KT...THE PRESSURE WOULD SUGGEST THAT HIGHER WINDS ARE PROBABLY

SSMI OVERPASS SHOWED GOOD ORGANIZATION IN THE LOW CLOUD BANDS AND
THE OUTFLOW PATTERN IS NOT BAD.  THERE ALSO APPEARS TO BE LESS
EASTERLY SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM THAN THERE WAS 24 HOURS AGO.

LAST VISIBLE IMAGES SUGGESTED A SLIGHTLY MORE WESTERLY TRACK...AND
THE INITIAL MOTION IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO BE 290/10.  THE

PRODUCE A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  HOWEVER...A

WHICH WOULD MOST LIKELY SLOW AND TURN THE SYSTEM MORE TO THE
NORTHWEST OR NORTH BY 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST HAS MORE
CURVATURE THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND IS IN BETWEEN THE MEDIUM
BAM AND THE STATISTICAL P91E.
 
THE SYSTEM HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE YESTERDAY BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN
ABLE TO SUSTAIN DEEP CONVECTION FOR VERY LONG.  THE SHIPS MODEL
PARAMETERS ARE ALL FAVORABLE AND THE MODEL BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO
74 KT IN 72 HOURS.  ON THE OTHER HAND...THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE
SYSTEM IN 30 HOURS.  THE GLOBAL MODELS ARE EQUALLY EQUIVOCAL...WITH
THE AVN STRENGTHENING THE SYSTEM AND THE UKMET DISSING IT.  GIVEN

THE CENTER IS VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON NIGHTTIME IMAGERY AND THE

A RECENT QUIKSCAT PASS IS AMBIGUOUS.  IT MAY BE THAT THERE IS NO
LONGER A CLOSED LOW LEVEL CENTER.  THE LAST DECENT LOCATION WAS FROM

DAYLIGHT FIXES.  THE AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE RIDGE CENTERED OVER
THE GULF OF MEXICO MOVING SLOWLY EASTWARD AND THE CUT-OFF LOW NEAR
BAJA CALIFORNIA BEING REPLACED BY ANOTHER ONE IN 72 HOURS.  THIS

COMPONENT OF MOTION.  THE GUIDANCE VARIES FROM DUE WEST TO A TURN

VISIBLE IMAGERY IS CONFUSING.  AN IMPRESSIVE SMALL CDO AND BANDING
FEATURE HAS RECENTLY FORMED BUT IT APPEARS TO BE WEST OF THE LOW
LEVEL CENTER.  UNLESS THERE IS MORE THAN ONE CENTER...WHICH IS A
POSSIBLITY SUGGESTED BY QUIKSCAT WIND FIELDS.  TRACKING WHAT APPEARS
TO BE THE LOW LEVEL CENTER GIVES AN INITIAL MOTION OF ABOUT 265/11. 
THE FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED TO THE LEFT OR SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY BUT OTHERWISE RETAINS A SIMILAR PHILOSOPHY OF SLOWING DOWN
AND TURNING NORTHWARD. THE GUIDANCE IS QUITE DIVERSE...RANGING FROM
DUE WEST TO NORTHEASTWARD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ABOUT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE AND ASSUMES THAT THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL
SCENARIO IS CORRECT...WITH A CUT-OFF LOW OVER BAJA CALIFORNIA BEING
REPLACED AND CAUSING A DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED AND NORTHWARD TURN.

THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 30 KNOTS.  SSTS ARE HIGH AND
VERTICAL SHEAR IS NIL.  THE FORECAST INTENSITY IS RIDDLED WITH
UNCERTAINTY DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THE WESTERN CLOUD PATTERN
BECOMES DOMINANT.  IF IT DOES...THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT
INTENSIFICATION.  OTHERWISE...THERE COULD BE DISSIPATION.  THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST REMAINS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
CALLING FOR SLOW STRENGTHING.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION NINETEEN-E HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED DURING
THE PAST 06 HOURS AND IS VERY NEAR TROPICAL STORM INTENSITY BASED ON
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 35 KT FROM TAFB...30 KT FROM
KGWC...AND 25 KT FROM SAB.  ALTHOUGH THE APPEARANCE IN SATELLITE
IMAGERY SUGGESTS TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WAS
HELD DOWN SLIGHTLY DUE TO ONLY INTERMITTENT CONVECTION OCCURRING
NEAR THE LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER.  OUTFLOW IS GOOD IN THE WEST
SEMICIRCLE AND RESTRICTED TO THE EAST.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/08.  THE SYSTEM CENTER HAS BEEN
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IN SATELLITE IMAGERY UNTIL THE PAST 03 HOURS.
NOW THAT CONVECTION APPEARS TO BE CONSOLIDATING CLOSER TO THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER...THE DEPRESSION SHOULD BE STEERED MORE BY THE DEEP
LAYER MEAN FLOW WHICH SUGGESTS A GRADUAL DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED.
05/00Z UPPER-AIR DATA AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATE THE
DEPRESSION IS TRACKING WESTWARD ALONG THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AXIS AND TOWARD A DEEP MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH
CURRENTLY ALONG 115W LONGITUDE.  THIS SYNOPTIC PATTERN FAVORS A
CONTINUED WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 36 HOURS...WITH A
GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH AFTERWARDS.  GIVEN THE
HIGH AMPLITUDE OF THE APPROACHING LONGWAVE TROUGH...RECURVATURE IS A
VERY DISTINCT POSSIBILITY AS INDICATED BY THE UKMET...GFDN...AND
NOGAPS MODELS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS TRACK
AND SIMILAR TO THE GFDN MODEL AND SLOWER THAN THE UKMET MODEL.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT
AND STRENGTHENING.  IN FACT...BY 48 TO 72 HOURS...THE APPROACHING
LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL LIKELY ENHANCE THE POLEWARD OUTFLOW...WHICH IS
ALSO FAVORABLE PATTERN FOR SOME STRENGTHENING TO OCCUR. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS A BLEND OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND THE LATEST SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST...WHICH BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO 64 KT IN 48
HOURS AND 74 KT IN 72 HOURS.

THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN CLOSE TO TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH...AND STILL
IS...BASED ON DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS.  HOWEVER THERE HAS BEEN SOME
DECREASE IN CENTRAL CONVECTION AND THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE
CLOUD PATTERN HAS NOT IMPROVED.  THEREFORE THE CYCLONE IS NOT BEING
UPGRADED AT THIS TIME.  GIVEN THAT THE SHEAR IS WEAK AND THE OCEAN
IS WARM...IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE DEPRESSION WILL BECOME A TROPICAL
STORM LATER TODAY.  SINCE THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SLOW TO DEVELOP THUS
FAR...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS LESS STRENGTHENING THAN
INDICATED BY THE SHIPS GUIDANCE.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 270/10.  THE CYCLONE IS BEING STEERED
WESTWARD BY THE FLOW TO THE SOUTH OF A WEAK MID-LEVEL RIDGE.  THE
GLOBAL MODELS SHOW AMPLIFICATION OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER
BAJA CALIFORNIA DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...AS
AN INITIAL IMPULSE IS KICKED OUT AND A STRONGER VORTICITY MAXIMUM
DROPS IN FROM CALIFORNIA.  IN SPITE OF THE AMPLITUDE OF THIS TROUGH
AS PREDICTED BY THE AVN...U.K. MET...AND NOGAPS MODELS...THE TRACK
GUIDANCE DOES NOT AGREE ON RECURVATURE OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THE
AVN AND ASSOCIATED BAM GUIDANCE KEEP THE CYCLONE MOSTLY ON A SLOW
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD TRACK...WHEREAS THE U.K. MET AND NOGAPS TURN THE
SYSTEM NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD BUT MOVE IT QUITE SLOWLY AS WELL.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK...WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...IS
A COMPROMISE OF THESE POSSIBILITIES.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/09. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE
TRACK FORECAST SCENARIO.  A CUT-OFF LOW OVER NORTHWEST MEXICO IS
FORECAST BY THE 06Z AVIATION MODEL RUN TO MOVE OUT AND BE REPLACED
BY ANOTHER IN 72 HOURS.  THIS SHOULD SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED AND
CAUSE A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH AS INDICATED BY THE GFDL...UKMET...
NOGAPS AND LBAR MODELS.  THE AVN...BAM AND STATISTICAL TRACK MODELS
HOWEVER SHOW A SLOW MOSTLY WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST CONTINUES TO LEAN TOWARD THE RECURVING
SOLUTION.
 
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 2.0/3.0/2.5 FROM SAB/TAFB/KGWC WITH A
RAGGED CDO FEATURE AND MINIMAL BANDING. IN CONTRAST...A 1203Z
QUIKSCAT PASS SHOWS AN EAST/WEST ELONGATED LOW AND ALL
UNCONTAMINATED WINDS BELOW 25 KNOTS.  THE FIRST VISIBLE IMAGERY DOES
NOT SHOW A WELL DEFINED CENTER ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE HIDDEN UNDER THE
CDO.  I AM RELUCTANTLY UPGRADING TO A 35 KNOT STORM AS A COURSE OF
LEAST REGRET.
 
THE SHIPS MODEL BRINGS THE WIND SPEED TO 72 KNOTS IN 72 HOURS BASED
MAINLY ON LITTLE VERTICAL SHEAR AND WARM SSTS.  BUT THE GFDL MODEL
DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM IN 36 HOURS AND THE UKMET GOES FOR SLIGHT
WEAKENING.  THE AVIATION MODEL ALSO FORECASTS LITTLE CHANGE.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE SLOW STRENGTHENING TO 50 KNOTS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/10.  THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE FROM
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY TRACK FORECAST SCENARIO.  A TROUGH OVER
NORTHWEST MEXICO AND THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. IS FORECAST BY THE 12Z
AVIATION MODEL RUN TO MOVE OUT AND BE REPLACED BY A CUT-OFF LOW BY

THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 40 KNOTS BASED ON DVORAK INTENSITY

ROSA HAD ITS BEST APPEARANCE RIGHT AROUND 00Z...WHEN THE DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB WERE 55 AND 45 KT...
RESPECTIVELY.  AT THAT TIME SOME BANDING HAD DEVELOPED TO THE NORTH
OF THE CENTER BUT THIS FEATURE HAS SINCE WEAKENED.  IN THE
MEANTIME...A NEW BURST IS GOING OFF VERY NEAR THE CENTER. 
OVERALL...THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME CONSOLIDATION OF THE CONVECTIVE
STRUCTURE AND THE INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 45 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.

THE CENTER IS NOT EASY TO LOCATE BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE FORWARD
MOTION HAS SLOWED.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 290/8...A
LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.  OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS
THE SPEED HAS BEEN CLOSE TO 6 KT.  WITH THE TRACK CONTINUING TO EDGE
TO THE RIGHT...THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF THE ANTICIPATED
NORTHWARD TURN IN ADVANCE OF THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AHEAD OF
THE CYCLONE.  THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST
TRACK.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE GUIDANCE IS NOT IN VERY GOOD
AGREEMENT...WITH THE UKMET...GFDL...AND NOGAPS SHOWING A HARD RIGHT
TURN TOWARDS THE COAST...AND THE AVN AND BAMS SHOWING A MORE
WESTWARD TRACK.

OUTFLOW APPEARS DECENT AND THE SHEAR IS LOW.  THE INTENSITY GUIDANCE
IS IN NO BETTER AGREEMENT THAN THE TRACK GUIDANCE.  THE SHIPS MODEL
FORECASTS 75 KT IN 72 HOURS...BUT THE GFDL WEAKENS THE SYSTEM
SHARPLY AFTER 30 HOURS.  WITH THE SSTS IN THE PATH OF ROSA BECOMING
INCREASINGLY WARM...THE MAIN INHIBITING FACTOR WOULD BE INCREASING
SHEAR FROM THE APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH...BUT THIS IS NOT LIKELY TO
BE IMPORTANT FOR ANOTHER 36-48 HOURS OR MORE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
SHOWS A CONTINUED SLOW INTENSIFICATION OVER THE NEXT DAY AND A HALF
AND LITTLE CHANGE THEREAFTER.  I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THE
SYSTEM IS BEGINNING TO ORGANIZE AN INNER CORE...AND IF THIS OCCURS
THEN A MORE RAPID INTENSIFICATION WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING.  THIS
COULD THEN MITIGATE AGAINST THE ANTICIPATED SHEAR INCREASE LATER. 
INTERESTS ALONG THE MEXICAN COAST FROM PUERTO ANGEL TO ZIHUATANEJO
SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF ROSA.

INNER CORE DOES NOT YET APPEAR TO BE WELL DEFINED.  INITIAL WINDS
ARE SET AT 55 KNOTS IN CONCURRENCE WITH DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.  SINCE CONDITIONS APPEAR TO BE FAVORABLE...
ROSA COULD BECOME A HURRICANE IN A DAY OR SO.  INCREASING SHEAR
AND/OR THE PROXIMITY TO LAND SHOULD CURTAIL STRENGTHENING LATER IN
THE PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST LEANS TOWARD...BUT IS A
LITTLE MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN...THE LATEST SHIPS GUIDANCE.  THE GFDL
MODEL SHOWS WEAKENING COMMENCING WITHIN 24 HOURS...EVEN THOUGH IT
PREDICTS THE CENTER TO REMAIN OVER WARM WATERS.  

CENTER POSITIONS USING INFRARED IMAGERY ARE SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN...BUT
EARLIER TRMM AND SSM/I IMAGERY SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER IS A LITTLE
TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF EARLIER ESTIMATES.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS NOW 325/6.  ROSA APPEARS TO BE RESPONDING THE FLOW AHEAD
OF A BROAD MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH WHICH EXTENDS FROM THE WESTERN
U.S. SOUTHWARD INTO NORTHERN MEXICO.  GLOBAL MODELS SHOW ADDITIONAL
VORTICITY ENTERING THE TROUGH...FORMING A  CUT-OFF LOW NEAR THE NEW
MEXICO/OLD MEXICO BORDER IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  ROSA IS EXPECTED TO
TURN NORTHWARD AND NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD IN RESPONSE TO THIS STEERING
REGIME.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED A BIT TO THE EAST
OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.  THIS IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE LATEST U.K. MET.
OFFICE MODEL RUN.  THE LATEST AVN RUN ALSO SHOWS THE STORM TURNING
TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHEAST...BUT GIVEN THE LARGE SCALE STEERING

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
1 AM PST TUE NOV 07 2000

IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER...BUT BEST ESTIMATES GIVE
A SLOW NORTHWARD MOTION...360/3.  THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE FROM THE
PREVIOUS TRACK FORECAST OR PROGNOSTIC REASONING.  GLOBAL MODELS SHOW
A GRADUAL INCREASE IN SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING FLOW ASSOCIATED
WITH A LARGE MID-LEVEL TROUGH DIGGING WEST AND NORTHWEST OF ROSA. 
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE
LATEST RUNS OF THE AVN...U.K. MET...AND GFDN MODELS.  THIS BRINGS
THE CENTER...OR AT LEAST THE TROPICAL STORM-FORCE WINDS...NEAR THE
COAST IN 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THEREFORE A TROPICAL STORM WARNING IS
REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.   

THE CLOUD PATTERN CONTINUES TO BE INDICATIVE OF SOUTHWESTERLY
SHEARING.  THERE IS ESSENTIALLY NO BANDING...AND THE CENTER IS
ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR THE SOUTHWEST EDGE OF AN IRREGULARLY-SHAPED
AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION.  BASED ON THE DISORGANIZED APPEARANCE...THE
CURRENT INTENSITY IS ADJUSTED DOWNWARD A BIT...TO 50 KNOTS.  THE
SHIPS MODEL STILL SHOWS SOME STRENGTHENING...BUT ALSO INDICATES
INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR.  BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE
THE SHEAR WILL DECREASE...NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS FORECAST UNTIL
THE CENTER REACHES THE COAST.  

AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE IS SCHEDULED TO INVESTIGATE ROSA
LATER TODAY...AND THIS SHOULD GIVE US MORE PRECISE INFORMATION ON
THE STRENGTH AND LOCATION OF ROSA.

THE CENTER REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE...EVEN WITH FIRST VISIBLE
IMAGERY...A TRMM OVERPASS...AND A RADAR IMAGE FROM PUERTO ANGEL.  TO
FURTHER CONFUSE...A QUIKSCAT PASS LAST NIGHT SHOWED NO CLOSED
CIRCULATION.  ASSUMING THERE IS A CLOSED CENTER...THE EVIDENCE
SUGGESTS THAT IT IS ABOUT 75 MILES EAST OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
TRACK.  SINCE THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY...I AM SHIFTING THE
TRACK ONLY 50 MILES EASTWARD.  OTHERWISE THE TRACK SCENARIO REMAINS
THE ABOUT SAME...SLOW FORWARD MOTION TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHEAST
FOLLOWING THE GFDL...UKMET AND NOGAPS MODELS.  THE AVN IS A LITTLE
FASTER AND THE LBAR IS A LOT FASTER.  THE CHANGE IN TRACK REQUIRES
SHIFTING THE WATCH AND WARNING EASTWARD.
 
SATELLITE DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE IN THE 45-55 KNOT RANGE
...AND THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 50 KNOTS.  ONLY THE UKMET
MODEL SHOWS ANY STRENGTHENING AND THE SHIPS MODEL INDICATES 31
KNOTS OF VERTICAL SHEAR IN 36 HOURS.  BUT RECENT IMAGERY SHOWS A
COLD CDO AND IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW TO THE EAST AND SOUTH.  SO I AM
FORECASTING AN INCREASE IN WIND SPEED TO 60 KNOTS BEFORE LANDFALL.
 
A USAF RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO REACH THE AREA ABOUT
16Z AND SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN LOCATION AND INTENSITY MAY BE
RESOLVED AT THAT TIME.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
1 PM PST TUE NOV 07 2000
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 035/5 BASED ON A USAF RECON FIX AT
17Z.  THE 12 AVIATION MODEL RUN SHOWS AN ANTICYLONE ANCHORED OVER
CUBA AND A TROUGH REAMPLIFYING OVER WESTERN NORTH AMERICA.  THE GFDL
MODEL RESPONDS TO THIS BY MOVING THE STORM VERY SLOWLY UNTIL
DISSIPATI0N IN 42 HOURS WITHOUT REACHING LAND.  THE OTHER MODELS
MOVE THE STORM NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD AT VARYING ACCELERATIONS OF
FORWARD SPEED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT OF
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND MOVES THE CENTER INLAND IN ABOUT 24 HOURS
WITH A 5 KNOT FORWARD MOTION.
 
RECON DATA PUTS THE WIND SPEED NEAR 50 KNOTS WITH 1000 MB CENTRAL
SURFACE PRESSURE.  IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE RECON REPORTED A
CLOSED EYEWALL OF 20 MILE DIAMETER.  THIS IS NOT SEEN ON SATELLITE
IMAGERY AND IS SOMETHING THAT IS USUALLY THOUGHT TO OCCUR ONLY WITH
HURRICANE INTENSITY.  A COLD CDO FEATURE DOES PERSIST...BUT SHIPS
AND THE GFDL MODEL SHOW NO STRENGTHENING BEFORE LANDFALL.

IN THE ABSENCE OF RECON THIS EVENING THE CENTER IS HARD TO
LOCATE...BUT IT APPEARS THAT ROSA IS BASICALLY ON TRACK.  THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 030/05.  NO MAJOR CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE TO
THE FORECAST TRACK...AND ROSA SHOULD MAKE LANDFALL IN THE VICINITY
OF PUERTO ANGEL WITHIN THE NEXT 12 HOURS.  

CONVECTIVE TOPS HAVE WARMED OVER THE PAST 6 TO 9 HOURS AND THE AREAL
COVERAGE HAS DECREASED MARKEDLY.  THE ADVISORY INTENSITY HAS BEEN
LOWERED TO 45 KT.  LITTLE CHANGE IS EXPECTED BEFORE LANDFALL. 
THEREAFTER...ROUGH TERRAIN SHOULD DISSIPATE THE SYSTEM BEFORE IT CAN
EMERGE INTACT INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO.

1 AM PST WED NOV 08 2000

IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THE CENTER ON INFRARED IMAGERY...BUT
BASED ON SSM/I IMAGERY AND SYNOPTIC DATA...ROSA APPEARS TO HAVE
MOVED SLIGHTLY TO THE EAST OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.  NONETHELESS...THE
CENTER APPEARS TO BE INLAND...A SHORT DISTANCE NORTHEAST OF PUERTO
ANGEL.  MOTION IS ABOUT 040/7.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A NE TO
NNE MOTION AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED.  THIS IS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT
WITH THE GFDN AND STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL GUIDANCE.

WITH THE CENTER INLAND...THE CYCLONE IS WEAKENING TO DEPRESSION
STRENGTH AND ALL TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE LOWERED.  SINCE THE
SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE MOVING OVER THE ROUGH TERRAIN OF
MEXICO TODAY...IT IS ASSUMED THAT ROSA WILL DISSIPATE BEFORE IT CAN
EMERGE INTACT INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO.

THE DEPRESSION IS WELL INLAND AND IS RAPIDLY WEAKENING OVER THE HIGH
TERRAIN. SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE CONVECTION HAS DECREASED AND
THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS BECOME ELONGATED.
  
THE DEPRESSION IS EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE TODAY WHILE MOVING NORTH
NORTHEAST BUT IT CAN STILL PRODUCE HEAVY RAINS OVER PORTIONS OF
EASTERN MEXICO.  THIS SYSTEM IS NOT EXPECTED TO REGENERATE OVER THE
BAY OF CAMPECHE AND THIS WILL BE THE LAST ADVISORY.
