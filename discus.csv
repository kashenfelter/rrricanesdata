NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT MON JUL 27 1998

SHIP REPORTS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY INCLUDING SCATTEROMETER WINDS
INDICATE THAT THE SYSTEM JUST OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA HAS A WELL-
DEFINED SURFACE CIRCULATION AND WE ARE IDENTIFYING IT AS TROPICAL
DEPRESSION NUMBER ONE.

TRACKING OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS GIVES A MOTION OF 280/24.  THE 00Z
AVIATION MODEL RUN SHOWS STEERING CURRENTS MUCH WEAKER THAN 24 KNOTS
SO THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS REDUCED TO 280/20.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS INDICATE LITTLE CHANGE IN MOTION OVER THE NEXT 72
HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST GOES ALONG WITH THIS.

THERE WERE THREE SHIPS AT 06Z IN THIS SYSTEM SHOWING A CLOSED
CIRCULATION OF ABOUT 15 KNOTS.  HOWEVER THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF
DEEP CONVECTION AND THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS ESTIMATED AT 25 KNOTS.

THE SHIPS STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL SHOWS THAT
CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING...SSTS ARE PLENTY
WARM AND THERE IS LITTLE VERTICAL SHEAR TO INHIBIT DEVELOPMENT.

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS SHOWS THAT WHILE
THE LOW LEVEL CENTER REMAINS FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED...CONVECTION HAS
DIMINISHED AROUND THE CENTER.  THUS...THE INTENSITY WILL BE
MAINTAINED AT 25 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION
OF THE SYSTEM IS RATHER IMPRESSIVE WITH GOOD OUTFLOW ESTABLISHED
OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS...AND CALLS FOR SOME GRADUAL STRENGTHENING THROUGH THE
PERIOD.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SHIPS STATISTICAL-DYNAMICAL
INTENSITY MODEL. 

RECENT SATELLITE FIXES PLACE THE CENTER A BIT FURTHER NORTHWARD... 
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/18 KNOTS.  A MID-LEVEL
RIDGE NORTH OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD KEEP IT ON A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK THROUGH ABOUT 48 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE AVIATION MODEL
BRINGS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROF/LOW SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR 40W.    
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST SHOWS A GRADUAL DECELERATION DUE TO 
THIS FEATURE.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE DISCUSSION NUMBER   3
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT MON JUL 27 1998

THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION HAS A LARGE BUT ELONGATED ENVELOPE AND IT
LACKS OF DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  SINCE THE DEPRESSION IS
OVER WARM WATERS...THE OUTFLOW IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND HAS SUCH A
LARGE ENVELOPE...I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT...TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING.  
HOWEVER... SINCE THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE SYSTEM IN 12 HOURS AND
SHIPS MODEL BRINGS THE SYSTEM TO 49 KNOTS...ONLY A SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST. 

THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON IR IMAGES AND THE
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/18.  ALL OF THE MODELS
THAT DEPEND ON THE AVN FORECAST FIELDS TURN THE DEPRESSION TO THE
NORTHWEST BY 48 HOURS.  THIS TURN IS CAUSED BY A DEVELOPING
MID-LEVEL TROUGH AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WHICH IS FORECAST BY THE AVN. 
ON THE OTHER HAND...THE UK AND NOGAPS MODELS MAINTAIN MORE OF A 500
MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  THAT PATTERN WOULD
SUGGEST A WEST TO WEST NORTHWEST TRACK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS TO THE LEFT OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE BUT VERY CLOSE TO CLIPER.
THERE IS TIME TO ADJUST THE FORECAST TRACK MORE TO THE
NORTHWEST...IF NECESSARY.  

NOGAPS TRACKING ALGORITHM DROPS THE DEPRESSION IN 12 HOURS OR SO 
BUT AN INSPECTION OF LOW-LEVEL FIELDS FROM THE 12Z RUN...ONE CAN
OBSERVE A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOVING DISTURBANCE WHICH APPROACHES
THE LESSER ANTILLES IN 5 DAYS OR SO.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE DISCUSSION NUMBER   4
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT TUE JUL 28 1998

THE DEPRESSION HAS NOT BECOME ANY BETTER ORGANIZED...AND THE CLOUD
PATTERN REMAINS ELONGATED FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING FROM NEAR 30N 20W
SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR 20N 30W...WHICH MAY BE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DISTORTION OF THE CLOUD PATTERN.  MOREOVER THE CYCLONE IS STILL 
INVOLVED WITH THE LOW-LEVEL MONSOONAL FLOW FEEDING TOWARDS WESTERN
AFRICA.  THE ABOVE TWO FACTORS MAY BE PREVENTING THE DEPRESSION FROM
STRENGTHENING AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...THE LATEST NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
RUN SHOWS THE UPPER TROUGH MIGRATING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AND A MORE
ANTICYCLONIC FLOW BUILDING OVER THE AREA OF THE DEPRESSION.  ALSO AS
THE DEPRESSION MOVES FARTHER WEST IT SHOULD ESCAPE FROM THE MONSOON
TROUGH AND PERHAPS ENCOUNTER BETTER LOW-LEVEL INFLOW.  ONLY TIME
WILL TELL OF COURSE.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND CALLS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING...BUT ONE SHOULD
BEAR IN MIND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EXCEEDINGLY LIMITED SKILL IN
INTENSITY PREDICTION.

IT IS NOT EASY TO FIX A CENTER FROM INFRARED IMAGERY...BUT THE BEST
ESTIMATE IS THAT THE FORWARD MOTION HAS SLOWED A LITTLE MORE.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THAT FROM THE LAST ADVISORY
BUT SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THIS IS CLOSEST TO THE SHALLOW-LAYER STEERING.

IF THE SYSTEM WERE TO STRENGTHEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN
FORECAST...IT WOULD LIKELY TURN MORE NORTHWESTWARD IN RESPONSE TO
THE HIGHER-LEVEL TROUGH TO ITS NORTH.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/17...SAME AS LAST ADVISORY.  THE
00Z RUN OF THE AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE DEPRESSION TURNING TOWARD
THE NORTH-NORTHWEST IN THE NEXT 3 DAYS...APPARENTLY FINDING A
WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE.  THE UKMET SHOWS
MORE OF A WEST-NORTHEWESTWARD TRACK WHILE THE NOGAPS AND GFDL MODELS
LOSE THE CIRCULATION BY 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A BLEND
OF ALL OF THE GUIDANCE AND IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...
CALLING FOR A SLIGHT TURN TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND SOME
DECELERATION.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A FAIRLY-WELL ORGANIZED LOW LEVEL
CIRCULATION BUT THE DEEP CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED THIS MORNING. 
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE FROM T NUMBERS 2.0 TO 2.5.  THE
WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 30 KNOTS AND GRADUAL STRENGHENING IS
FORECAST AS THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF STRONG VERTICAL WIND SHEAR DURING

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/21 AND THIS IS SOMEWHAT FASTER
THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS THE
DEPRESSION TURNING TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHWEST INTO A WEAKNESS IN THE
SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE...THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME SCENARIO
AS THE 00Z MODEL RUN AND ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE
SIMILAR TO THE LAST PACKAGE.  SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY EXCEPT A LITTLE FASTER DURING THE
FIRST 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY CONSIDERABLE DECELERATION.  AS
BEFORE...THE GFDL AND NOGAPS MODELS LOSE THE CIRCULATION IN 24
HOURS.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A WELL-DEFINED LOW-LEVEL CLOUD STRUCTURE AND
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE AT MINIMAL TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH WHILE KGWC GAVE A 2.0 T NUMBER.   HOWEVER I PREFER TO
WAIT FOR THE APPEARANCE OF SOME MORE DEEP CONVECTION BEFORE
UPGRADING TO A TROPICAL STORM.  THE FORECAST...AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...IS FOR GRADUAL STRENGTHENING FOLLOWING THE SHIPS
STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL INTENSITY MODEL.  

THIS SYSTEM IS FAIRLY LARGE AND THE WIND SPEED RADII IN THE
FORECAST/ADVISORY ARE INCREASED A LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS BLOSSOMED A LITTLE THIS EVENING NEAR THE
CIRCULATION CENTER AND IN A BAND IN THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE.  THIS
DEVELOPMENT...ALONG WITH TAFB AND SAB GIVING DVORAK TECHNIQUE
T-NUMBERS OF 2.5...SUPPORT UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM
ALEX WITH 35 KT WINDS.  THE SPURT IN FORWARD SPEED NOTED EARLIER
TODAY SEEMS TO HAVE ENDED AND INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT
280/18 KT.
 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION WITH MULTIPLE
VORTICES TO THE NORTH TO NE OF THE TROPICAL STORM.  THE 12Z AVN
HAS THIS FEATURE PRIMARILY IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE...PERHAPS MOST
DISTINCT NEAR 300 MB.  AT 500 MB...IT SHOWS A WESTWARD RETROGRESSION
OF AN ANTICYCLONE FROM 35-40W TO 55-60W OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS...BUT
INDICATES THAT THE HIGH WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT ALEX
FROM GRADUALLY ACQUIRING A GREATER NORTHWARD COMPONENT.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT IDEA...AS IS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
WHICH IS A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS NHC FORECAST.  FURTHER
DECELERATION IS ALSO PREDICTED.  ALTERNATELY...THE 12Z NOGAPS SHOWS
THE RETROGRADING HIGH TO BE STRONGER...AND KEEPS THE STORM AT FAIRLY
LOW LATITUDE...LOCATED ABOUT 200 NM SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST POINT AT
72 HOURS.
 
ALTHOUGH SOME MID-LEVEL MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE HEADING NORTHEASTWARD
AWAY FROM THE CENTER...MOST FACTORS INFLUENCING INTENSITY...AS
INDICATED BY THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST GUIDANCE...POINT TOWARD
STRENGTHENING.
 
A SHIP REPORT OF 10 KT 150 NM TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE SYSTEM AT 18Z
SUGGESTS THAT THE WIND RADII ARE NOT TOO LARGE AS YET...AT LEAST IN
THAT PART OF THE CIRCULATION.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT WED JUL 29 1998

DEEP CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED NEAR THE ESTIMATED CENTER...BUT THERE
ARE NO BANDING FEATURES EVIDENT AT THIS TIME.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS
HELD AT 35 KNOTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH DVORAK ESTIMATES FROM THE
TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THAT ALEX IS
MOVING INTO A COL IN THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW...SUGGESTING A WEAK SHEAR
ENVIRONMENT.  SO...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.  THIS IS ALSO IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST STATISTICAL
HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...GUIDANCE.  

ALTHOUGH THE CYCLONE APPEARS TO HAVE A LARGE CIRCULATION ENVELOPE...
CURRENTLY THE AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION IS RELATIVELY SMALL.  THUS THE
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND RADII ARE NOT ESTIMATED TO BE VERY LARGE
AT THIS TIME.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THERE IS QUITE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN THE
OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS.  DEEP LAYER STEERING FROM THE
AVIATION MODEL SHOWS A MORE NORTHWESTWARD COURSE DEVELOPING SOON. 
THIS APPEARS TO BE DUE TO MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL VORTICITY BEING DRAWN
SOUTHWESTWARD AHEAD OF ALEX...FROM A TROUGH THAT IS NOW NORTH OF THE
STORM.  HOWEVER THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECASTS ALSO SHOW A STRONG MID-
TROPOSPHERIC HIGH NORTH OF 20N AND WEST OF 50W IN DAY OR TWO.  IF
THE ABOVEMENTIONED VORTICITY FEATURE IS NOT SO PROMINENT...THEN ALEX
MAY BE FORCED ON A MORE WESTWARD TRACK.  INDEED...THIS IS WHAT IS
SUGGESTED BY THE LATEST GFDL GUIDANCE.  FOR NOW...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SHIFTED ONLY SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES THIS MORNING SHOWS THAT THE LOW-LEVEL
CENTER OF ALEX IS WEST OF THE LIMITED DEEP CONVECTION...AND THIS

ALEX IS MOVING INTO A COL IN THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW SUGGESTING A
WEAKER SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT ANALYSES
FROM THE COOPERATIVE INSTITUTE FOR METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE STUDIES.

THUS...STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST WITH THE INTENSIFICATION TREND FROM
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY PRESERVED.    
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 280/17 KNOTS.  THE 12Z TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW A BIT LESS SCATTER THAN EARLIER WITH MOST
INDICATING A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST COURSE AND A SLOWING IN FORWARD
SPEED BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE PRIMARY QUESTION REGARDING THE
TRACK FORECAST REMAINS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW NEAR
25N55W WHICH WOULD IMPART A MORE NORTHERLY COMPONENT OF MOTION.

DEEP CONVECTION HAS MADE A BIT OF A COMEBACK DURING THE DAY ALTHOUGH
IT IS NOT TERRIBLY WELL-ORGANIZED.  THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT IS
THAT THE CONVECTION IS FORMING CLOSER TO THE CENTER SUGGESTING THAT
ALEX IS MOVING INTO A LIGHTER VERTICAL SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  HOWEVER
...THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF OUTFLOW AND THE DRIER AIR NOTED IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WEST OF ALEX IS NOT CONDUCIVE FOR STRENGTHENING.
OVERALL...THE SYSTEM DOES NOT LOOK VERY HEALTHY AND THE CURRENT
INTENSITY IS HELD AT 35 KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL FORECAST TO
GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN WITH PROGRESSIVELY WARMER SST/S AHEAD AND
IMPROVING UPPER ENVIRONMENT. 

A NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHIC OFFICE DRIFTING BUOY LOCATED ABOUT 100 NM
WEST-NORTHWEST OF THE CENTER REPORTED A 10 METER/6 MINUTE WIND OF 
31 KNOTS AND A PRESSURE OF 1013 MB AT 18Z.  THIS IS CONSISTENT 
WITH OUR CURRENT TROPICAL STORM RADII.
  
THE CENTER HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO LOCATE DURING THE DAY. 
CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE SATELLITE FIXES SUGGEST THE CENTER IS A 
TAD SOUTH AND IS MOVING SLIGHTLY SLOWER.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 275/14 KNOTS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A COMPLEX
UPPER AIR PATTERN OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC.  THE AVIATION MODEL
DEVELOPS A MID-TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
AS A RESULT...THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS SHOW A GENERAL
WESTERLY TRACK THROUGH 36 HOURS...FOLLOWED BY A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST
COURSE.  THE GFDL AND NOGAPS ARE THE SOUTHERN-MOST TRACKS.  WHILE
THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER FEATURES

SATELLITE PICTURES OF ALEX SHOW A LESS COHERENT PATTERN THAN 24
HOURS AGO.  DEEP CONVECTION IS LIMITED AND NOT WELL ORGANIZED AND
THE OVERALL CONFIGURATION...PARTICULARLY AT MID LEVELS...HAS BEEN
ELONGATED FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST BY AN INTERACTION WITH A
COMPLEX CYCLONIC CIRCULATION SEEN NEARBY IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.
THE INITIAL WIND SPEED FOR THIS ADVISORY IS AGAIN 35 KT.
 
ALEX IS MOVING JUST NORTH OF DUE WEST AT ABOUT 13 KT.  WHETHER ALEX
HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE LESSER ANTILLES DEPENDS ON HOW SOON AND
HOW MUCH THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTH IS ERODED
WHEN THE LONGWAVE TROUGH ALONG THE EAST COAST IS REINFORCED.
YESTERDAY...THE 12Z NOGAPS SEEMED TO PROVIDE THE BEST GUIDANCE...
KEEPING A STRONGER HIGH TO THE NORTH AND A MORE WESTERLY TRACK THAN
SHOWN BY THE OTHER MODELS.  THERE IS A SIMILAR DIFFERENCE TODAY WITH
THE NEW 18Z AVN NOW ALSO SHOWING A PROLONGED WESTWARD HEADING...
THROUGH 36-48 HOURS.  IN DEFERENCE TO YESTERDAYS PARTIAL
VERIFICATION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
CLUSTER OF 12Z AVN-BASED TRACKS...BUT NOT AS FAR SOUTH AS THE
NOGAPS.
  
INTENSIFICATION IS STILL POSSIBLE AND THE GFDL AND SHIPS SCHEMES
BRING ALEX TO THE THRESHOLD OF HURRICANE STRENGTH BY 72 HOURS.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST ALSO SHOWS STRENGTHENING...BUT THIS IS POSTPONED
ABOUT A DAY...UNTIL THE PERIOD WHEN THE AVN SHOWS A SOMEWHAT MORE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

THE STORM CONTINUES TO LOOK LESS-ORGANIZED THAN IT DID 24 HOURS
AGO...AND MAXIMUM WIND ESTIMATE IS UNCHANGED FOR THIS ADVISORY. 
INFRARED IMAGERY SHOWS SOUTHERLY SHEARING OVER ALEX...ALTHOUGH WATER
VAPOR ANIMATION SUGGESTS FAIRLY WEAK SHEAR JUST AHEAD.  SINCE THE
SYSTEM HAS FAILED TO STRENGTHEN SIGNIFICANTLY THUS FAR...NO CHANGE
IS FORECAST FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS WITH ONLY A MODEST INCREASE
THEREAFTER.  THE SHIPS MODEL GIVES A SIMILAR INTENSITY FORECAST.

MOTION CONTINUES SLIGHTLY NORTH OF WEST AROUND 13 KT.  ACCORDING TO
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...A MID/UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE/VORTMAX IS
PREDICTED TO BE BETWEEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AND ALEX IN 2-3 DAYS. 
THIS FEATURE...IF IT VERIFIES...WOULD INDUCE A MORE NORTHWESTWARD
MOTION LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE LATEST NOGAPS RUN PAINTS A
SIMILAR PICTURE.  HOWEVER...THE 00Z GFDL MODEL RUN SHOWS A MORE
SOUTHERN TRACK.  IN DEFERENCE TO THE LATTER MODEL...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST ONLY BENDS THE TRACK TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST DURING THE
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS NHC
FORECAST.

11 AM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

THERE IS AN AREA OF CONCENTRATED CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND
CONSEQUENTLY THE DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE 3.0 FROM BOTH TAFB AND SAB.
THEREFORE...THE WINDS ARE ADJUSTED TO 45 KNOTS.  THE OUTFLOW IS
PARTIALLY RESTRICTED BUT IS ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM. THERE ARE
HOSTILE UPPER LEVEL WINDS AHEAD OF THE STORM...HOWEVER ...GLOBAL
MODELS SUGGEST THAT THESE WESTERLIES WILL WEAKEN OR RETROGRADE AND
THEN SOME SOUTHERLY SHEAR MAY DEVELOP. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS
FOR SOME STRENGTHENING SINCE THE GFDL AND SHIPS MODELS BRING THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE TO 65 TO 65 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.  ON THE LONGER
RANGE...4-5 DAYS... THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS BECOME A LITTLE MORE
FAVORABLE IN THE AREA BETWEEN PUERTO RICO AND BERMUDA.

ALEX IS CURRENTLY MOVING AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A WELL ESTABLISHED
DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE AT ABOUT 280/13.  THIS RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
HAVE A WEAKNESS ALONG 60-65 WEST. THIS WOULD INDUCE A TRACK MORE TO
THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
ON THIS TRACK...ALEX WOULD SKIRT THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS BUT
THEY STILL NEED TO MONITOR THIS STORM. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY
CLOSE TO THE GFDL BUT TO THE SOUTH OF MOST OF THE OTHER GUIDANCE.  

THE HIGH ALTITUDE NOOA JET IS SCHEDULED TO SAMPLE THE ENVIRONMENT
SURROUNDING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE LATE FRIDAY.

5 PM EDT THU JUL 30 1998

ALEX HAS MAINTAINED ITS DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER DURING THE
PAST SEVERAL HOURS WHILE THE OUTFLOW IS BECOMING A LITTLE BETTER
ORGANIZED.  HOWEVER...T-NUMBERS REMAIN ABOUT 3.0 SO THE WINDS ARE
KEPT AT 45 KNOTS AT THIS TIME. ALEX IS DEFINITIVELY BETTER ORGANIZED
THAN YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME. A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT IS EXPECTED TO
PERSIST AHEAD OF THE STORM BUT IT WILL BE WEAK ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME
SLOW STRENGTHENING OF THE STORM.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS ALEX
TO A 65-KNOT HURRICANE BY 48 HOURS AS SUGGESTED BY THE GFDL AND
SHIPS MODELS.  ON THE LONGER RANGE...4-5 DAYS... THE UPPER LEVEL
WINDS BECOME A LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE IN THE AREA BETWEEN PUERTO RICO
AND BERMUDA.

MOST OF THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE SAME SCENARIO. A WELL
ESTABLISHED DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE WHICH IS FORECAST TO HAVE A
WEAKNESS ALONG 60-65 WEST.  THIS PATTERN WOULD INDUCE A TRACK MORE
TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  ON THIS TRACK...THE CORE OF ALEX WOULD SKIRT THE NORTHERN
LEEWARD ISLANDS AS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH IN FACT
IS CLOSE TO THE GFDL.

LONG RANGE MODELS ARE DEVELOPING A LARGE TROUGH ALONG EAST COAST OF
THE UNITED STATES.  IF THIS VERFIES...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL TAKE
A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC.

11 PM EDT THU JUL 30 1998
 
ALEX IS GENERATING A CENTRAL AREA OF INTENSE CONVECTION WITH A
FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL HIGH-LEVEL OUTFLOW.  AT AN INTERMEDIATE
LEVEL...HOWEVER...THERE REMAINS A DISTINCT SSW CURRENT ACROSS THE
STORM ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AHEAD OF THE STORM.  THIS IS
JUST ONE PART OF A COMPLICATED CIRCULATION ALOFT THAT INCLUDES A
WELL-DEFINED VORTEX SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO
THE NORTHWEST OF ALEX.  THE AVN MODEL SHOWS THAT VORTEX AT 300-500
MB.  

THE INTENSE OUTFLOW AT CIRRUS LEVEL HAS OBSCURED THE CENTRAL
FEATURES...MAKING POSITIONING SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULT.  ANALYSES
FROM TAFB...SAB..AND AFWA...HOWEVER...INDICATE THAT A HEADING TOWARD
THE WNW HAS BEGUN...PERHAPS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOW DEEP ENOUGH TO
RESPOND MORE TO THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW IN ITS ENVIRONMENT.  THE MOTION
IS ESTIMATED AT 290/11 KT.  WIND SPEED IS NEAR 45 KT.
 
THE PATTERN ALOFT IS FORECAST TO REMAIN COMPLEX...WITH THE AVN
KEEPING A VORTEX TO THE NW-N OF ALEX THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS
IS INTERPRETED AS A GENERAL WEAKNESS IN THE HEIGHT PATTERN THAT
SHOULD ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN THE NORTHWARD COMPONENT.  THE
RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE FEATURES WILL PROBABLY INFLUENCE HOW
SMOOTH THE TRANSITION IN TRACK WILL BE.  THE TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS
LITTLE DIVERSITY.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NEAR THE CENTER OF THE
CLUSTER OF MODEL TRACKS AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE 18 AVN AND 12Z
NOGAPS FORECASTS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS 6 HOURS AGO.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON INFRARED IMAGERY AS A LARGE
CDO TYPE FEATURE IS OBSCURING THE LOWER CLOUDS.  TAFB AND SAB ARE
OVER 60 NMI APART IN THEIR 0545Z POSITION ESTIMATES.  THE OFFICIAL
INITIAL POSITION AND MOTION...290/11...MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THE POSITION IS NEAR THE SOUTHWEST EDGE OF THE
DEEP CONVECTION SUGGESTING SOME SOUTHERLY VERTICAL SHEAR.  IF THE
CENTER IS ACTUALLY EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION...ALEX COULD
BE STRONGER THAN WE ARE ESTIMATING AND ALSO MOVING WITH MORE OF A
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION.

THE TRACK MODELS ARE ALL CLOSELY CLUSTERED AND SHOW A MOSTLY
NORTHWESTWARD TRACK FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS...MOVING INTO A WEAKNESS
IN THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE AND IS SIMILAR AND AN UPDATE TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.

THE INITIAL AND FORECAST INTENSITY ARE THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS

RELOCATED TO THE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS POSITION.  GLOBAL MODELS ARE

PERSIST FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME...AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RELAX
UNTIL 72 HOURS.  INITIAL INTENSITY IS 45 KNOTS AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR NO CHANGE AT THIS TIME. MOREOVER... WEAKENING MAY
BE INDICATED IN THE NEXT ADVISORY IF THIS TREND CONTINUES.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 270/10.  THE STEERING PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED AND
IF ALEX SURVIVES...IT IS EXPECTED TO TURN MORE TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST AS INDICATED BY MOST OF THE MODELS.  IF ALEX
BECOMES COMPLETELY EXPOSED AND WEAKENS FURTHER... THE SYSTEM COULD
MOVE MORE TO THE WEST.  HOWEVER...UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES HAVE BECOME

YESTERDAY...WE FORECAST THAT ALEX WAS GOING TO REACH HURRICANE
STATUS IN ABOUT 48 HOURS.  INSTEAD...STRONG SOUTHERLY UPPER-LEVEL
WINDS HIT THE STORM REMOVING MOST OF THE CONVECTION FROM THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER AND CONSEQUENTLY...WEAKENING HAS OCCURRED.  THIS
WEAKENING WAS NOT INDICATED BY ANY OF THE AVAILABLE TOOLS AND
REFLECTS HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT FORECASTING INTENSITY CHANGES.
AFTER THE FACT....IT IS SOMETIMES EASY TO FIND AN EXPLANATION.

IT APPEARS THAT THE WIND SHEAR WILL PERSIST SO WEAKENING SHOULD
CONTINUE AND ALEX COULD BE DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION
TONIGHT OR SATURDAY.   INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO 35
KNOTS AND WINDS ARE KEPT AT 30 KNOTS THROUGH 72 HOURS.  

NOW THAT WE CAN SEE THE LOW LEVEL CENTER...WE HAVE A BETTER ESTIMATE
OF THE INITIAL MOTION WHICH IS 280/10.  A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST IS EXPECTED OF WHATEVER IS LEFT OF ALEX.
HOWEVER...IF IT BECOMES AN OPEN WAVE THE SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY
PROPAGATE WESTWARD SPREADING SHOWERS AND SQUALLS.

ALEX IS STILL GENERATING A FEW CLUSTERS OF DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE
NORTHERN PART OF ITS CIRCULATION AND...AS SUGGESTED BY DVORAK
TECHNIQUE ANALYSES...THE SYSTEM IS PROBABLY STILL A TROPICAL STORM.
ESTIMATED WINDS ARE 35 KT.  DATA FROM THE NOAA HIGH-ALTITUDE JET
SEEMS TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL SHEARING
PATTERN MAINLY BELOW ALEX/S CIRRUS CANOPY LEVEL.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 275/11 KT.  TRACK FORECASTING BECOMES MORE
DIFFICULT THAN USUAL WHEN...LIKE NOW...IT IS ALSO TIED TO A HIGHLY
UNCERTAIN INTENSITY FORECAST.  THERE APPEAR TO BE THREE PRIMARY
POSSIBILITIES.  FIRST...IF THE SHEAR SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTEDLY DECREASES
THEN ALEX COULD STRENGTHEN AND TURN MORE TOWARD THE WNW OR NW...
DIMINISHING ANY THREAT TO THE CARIBBEAN.  SECOND...ALEX COULD WEAKEN
FURTHER OR DISSIPATE WITH ITS REMNANTS MOVING NEARLY WESTWARD...
AGAIN HAVING MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE CARIBBEAN.  THIRD...THE SYSTEM
COULD REMAIN MUCH AS IT IS...UNIMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE PICTURES...
BUT A POTENTIAL PRODUCER OF SOME HEAVY RAIN AND THE POSSIBILITY OF
LOCAL FLOODING AND HIGH WIND GUSTS FOR THE LEEWARD ISLANDS HAVING
HIGH TERRAIN.
 
WITH SHEAR EXPECTED TO PERSIST...THE SECOND SCENARIO MIGHT BE THE
MOST LIKELY.  HOWEVER...PARTLY TO BE CAUTIONS...THE CURRENT FORECAST
HAS A LITTLE MORE OF AN INKLING OF THE THIRD POSSIBILITY THAN WE
HAVE INDICATED PREVIOUSLY.  THE TRACK IS SHIFTED TO THE LEFT A
LITTLE AND IF THIS TREND IS OBSERVED OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS
...SOME CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO ISSUING A TROPICAL
STORM WATCH OR WARNING FOR A PORTION OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS ON
SATURDAY.  THE NHC TRACK IS BETWEEN BAMS AND CLIPER...WHICH FORM THE

MAINTAINED AS A MINIMUM TROPICAL STORM...35 KNOTS... FOR THIS

IN ITS WEAKEN STATE ALEX/S MOTION IS BEING CONTROLLED BY LOW-LEVEL
TROPOSPHERIC STEERING...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 275/12
KNOTS.  AS STATED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY THE TRACK AND INTENSITY
FORECASTS FOR ALEX ARE INTERTWINED. DATA FROM THE G-IV HIGH-ALTITUDE
JET AIRCRAFT MISSION FRIDAY AFTERNOON REVEALED 30-40 KNOT SOUTH/
SOUTHWEST WINDS BETWEEN 200 AND 250 MB IN THE VICINITY OF THE
SYSTEM.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW ABOUT
11 DEG NW OF ALEX HELPING TO BACK THE FLOW OVER THE EASTERN
CARIBBEAN.  SO...THE SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST.  IF THE SHEAR DID RELAX ALEX COULD STRENGTHEN
AND TURN MORE WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST... AND MOST OF THE TRACK
MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS THIS SCENARIO.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A LESS
PLAUSIBLE POSSIBILITY.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD HEADING THROUGH
24 HOURS WITH A MORE WEST-NORTHWEST THEN NORTHWEST TRACK THEREAFTER.

THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS IN CLOSE
AGREEMENT WITH BAM SHALLOW.  WITH THE VERTICAL WIND SHEAR EXPECTED

STORM FORCE WINDS WERE OBSERVED BY THE FLIGHT CREW...BUT ONLY IN THE
THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS NORTH OF THE NOW ALMOST ENTIRELY EXPOSED
LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  THE SUSTAINED WINDS ARE LIKELY NOW AT MOST 45 KT. 
INITIAL MOTION IS NEAR 300/13 KT.
 
THE FUTURE TRACK AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALEX ARE COMPLICATED BY A
FRACTURED CIRCULATION PATTERN OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WITH
ANOTHER LOW-LEVEL VORTEX TO THE WNW OF ALEX AND WITH SOME MODELS
INDICATING THAT YET ANOTHER LOW WILL DEVELOP FROM THE BAROCLINIC
ZONE ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST.  ALOFT...A LARGE AND PERSISTENT
CYCLONIC CIRCULATION IS NOTED.  REMARKABLY...THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS
RELATIVELY UNIFORM...SUGGESTING A WNW TO NW TRACK THROUGH 48 HOURS. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THOSE TRACKS AND
SIMILAR TO THE GFDL.
  
ALEX/S INTENSITY WILL BE PARTLY A FUNCTION OF HOW IT NEGOTIATES A
TRACK AROUND...OR THROUGH...THE UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATION. 
WITHOUT HAVING A GOOD HANDLE ON HOW THAT INTERACTION WILL PLAY
OUT...THE CURRENT FORECAST WILL SHOW NO CHANGE IN WIND SPEED.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
STORM.  ALEX REMAINS IN A SHEARED STATE WITH THE CENTER LOCATED TO
THE SOUTH OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN
UPPER LEVEL LOW NEAR 25N64W WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SOUTH-
SOUTHWESTERLY SHEARING.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THE
SYSTEM HAS DROPPED BELOW STORM STRENGTH...BUT WE WILL WAIT FOR THE
AIR FORCE RECON LATER TODAY TO CONFIRM THIS.  SINCE THERE IS STILL A
SLIM POSSIBILITY THAT UPPER-LEVEL CONDITIONS COULD BECOME LESS
HOSTILE FOR STRENGTHENING...AS INDICATED BY MODELS SUCH AS THE
STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS THE WINDS AT 35 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

ALEX HAS TURNED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT AND IS NOW MOVING AT AN
ESTIMATED 310/11.  THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST IS TO THE RIGHT OF
THE PREVIOUS ONE AND NEAR THE CONSENSUS OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACKS. 
THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB LOW NEAR THE SOUTH CAROLINA
COAST WITH A HIGH CENTERED JUST EAST OF BERMUDA IN 2-3 DAYS.  THIS
SUPPORTS A CONTINUED NORTHWESTWARD...PERHAPS MORE NORTH-
NORTHWESTWARD... MOVEMENT OF ALEX.

PERSISTENT SHEARING FROM SOUTH-SOUTHWESTWERLY UPPER-LEVEL WINDS HAS
TAKEN ITS TOLL ON ALEX...ESSENTIALLY DISSIPATING IT.  REPORTS FROM A
HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM NO LONGER HAS A CLOSED
