5 PM EDT FRI JUN 11 1999
 
THE CENTER OF THE BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA SOUTHEAST OF BERMUDA RE-
FORMED NEAR AN AREA OF CONVECTION LAST NIGHT...FOLLOWED BY RAPID
ORGANIZATION DURING THE DAY. LATEST DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS ARE T2.0
AND T1.5 FROM TAFB AND SAB RESPECTIVELY...SUPPORTING THE UPGRADE TO
TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN...WITH THE BEST ESTIMATE
BEING 055/11. THE CYCLONE IS SOUTH OF THE MAIN BAND OF WESTERLIES...
WITH THE AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS INDICATING A DEEP LAYER RIDGE
BUILDING NORTH OF THE SYSTEM DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS. NHC
HURRICANE GUIDANCE MODELS ARE HIGHLY DIVERGENT...WITH THE LBAR AND
A98E MOVING THE CYCLONE TO THE EAST AND THE BAMS MOVING IT NW. THE
GFDL STALLS THE SYSTEM NEAR 29N58W...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO THE GFDL ALTHOUGH A BIT FARTHER EAST.
 
THE DEPRESSION EXHIBITS A GOOD CLOUD PATTERN IN VISIBLE IMAGERY...
WITH CONSIDERABLE BANDING SURROUNDING A RAGGED CDO. IT IS LIKELY THE
SYSTEM WILL REACH TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH IN 12 HOURS...IF IT HAS
NOT DONE SO ALREADY. THE LARGE SPREAD BETWEEN THE 72 HOUR POSITIONS
OF BAMS AND BAMD SUGGEST INCREASING SHEAR LATE IN THE FORECAST
PERIOD...AND THE CYCLONE WILL BE OVER 24-25C SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES. THE FORECAST INTENSITY THUS LEVELS OFF AT 50 KT AFTER
36 HOURS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT FRI JUN 11 1999
 
INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE DEPRESSION IS VERY
CLOSE TO TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  LATEST DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS ARE
T2.5 FROM TAFB AND T2.0 FROM SAB AND AIR FORCE GLOBAL.  HOWEVER...
CONVECTION ON THE SOUTH SIDE HAS DIMINISHED AND THE OVERALL BANDING
IS NOT AS IMPRESSIVE AS SEVERAL HOURS AGO.  WITH SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES NEAR 25 DEGREES...WINDS AT THE SURFACE ARE PROBABLY
STILL BELOW TROPICAL STORM FORCE.  UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW OVER THE
DEPRESSION IS STILL IMPRESSIVE AND SOME INTENSIFICATION IS STILL
LIKELY.

A CENTRAL WARM SPOT HAS ASSISTED IN FIXING THE CENTER ON IR
IMAGERY...AND THE FORWARD SPEED OF THE DEPRESSION HAS SLOWED TO
040/5.  THE CYCLONE IS SOUTH OF THE MAIN BAND OF WESTERLIES...WITH
THE AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS INDICATING A DEEP LAYER RIDGE BUILDING
NORTH OF THE SYSTEM DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  TRACK GUIDANCE
MODELS REMAIN HIGHLY DIVERGENT...WITH THE LBAR AND A98E MOVING THE
CYCLONE TO THE EAST AND THE MEDIUM BAM AND THE GFDL MOVING IT
NORTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SOMEWHAT TO THE LEFT
OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...BUT NOT AS SHARPLY AS THE GFDL TRACK.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 030/04.  THE AVIATION MODEL SHOWS
A HIGH PERSISTING TO THE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION AND MOST OF THE
TRACK GUIDANCE RESPONDS WITH LITTLE NORTHWARD MOTION FOR THE NEXT
THREE DAYS.  THE LBAR AND STATISTICAL DYNAMICAL MODELS SHOW A MOTION
TOWARD THE EAST WHILE THE REMAINDER OF THE MODELS SHOW NO EAST/WEST
MOTION OR A SLOW WESTWARD COMPONENT.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO AND SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND NEAR THE
GFLD MODEL WHICH SHOWS A VERY SLOW NORTH TO NORTHWEST DRIFT FOR
THREE DAYS.
 
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SYSTEM ON
INFRARED IMAGERY...WHAT LITTLE DEEP CONVECTION EXISTS IS NOT WELL
ORGANIZED NOR IS THE BANDING WELL DEFINED.  THEREFORE THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY FORECAST IS A LITTLE SLOWER IN DEVELOPMENT THAN THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY...IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS INTENSITY
MODEL.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE HAS BECOME CONSIDERABLY BETTER ORGANIZED
OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS.  MOREOVER...DURING THE LAST 6 HOURS
CONVECTION HAS INCREASED NEAR THE CENTER.  DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS
REFLECT THE DEVELOPMENT TREND AS BOTH TAFB AND SAB NOW HAVE A CI
NUMBER OF 2.5.  THUS...TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE IS BEING UPGRADED 
TO TROPICAL STORM ARLENE.  

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/03 KNOTS.  THE FIXES FROM TAFB
...SAB AND AFGWC ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER
HAS DRIFTED NORTH-NORTHWEST OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS. THE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO SHOW CONSIDERABLE SCATTER WITH THE STATISTICAL
MODELS SHOWING A NORTHWARD MOTION WHILE MOST OF THE DYNAMIC MODELS
SHOW A NORTH-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST HEADING. THE GFDL FOLLOWS THE
LATTER SCENARIO THRU 24 HRS THEN TURNS THE CYCLONE WEST THEN
SOUTHWEST.  THE REASONING BEHIND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REMAINS
UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. THE LATEST NHC TRACK IS 
SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED ON THE INITIAL MOTION
AND STILL HOLDS TO A VERY SLOW NORTH-NORTHWEST DRIFT THRU 72 HRS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST BRINGS ARLENE TO 45 KNOTS BY 24 HRS WITH
NO CHANGE THEREAFTER.

ARLENE HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY AS THE
CENTER IS NOW JUST UNDERNEATH A SMALL CDO. THE SYSTEM HAS GOOD
OUTFLOW OVER THE NORTHERN SEMICIRCLE AND RESTRICTED ELSEWHERE.
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 45 KT AND
35 KT...RESPECTIVELY.  THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE
RAISED TO 40 KT. THE INTENSITY FORECAST BRINGS ARLENE TO 45
KNOTS BY 12 HRS WITH NO CHANGE THEREAFTER.
 
THE LATEST SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB SHOW THAT ARLENE
HAS BEEN DRIFTING NORTHWARD AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS 360/02
KNOTS. THE SYSTEM IS IN A WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT BETWEEN
TWO MID- TO UPPER LEVEL LOWS...ONE JUST OFF THE MID ATLANTIC
COAST AND ANOTHER ABOUT 500 MILES WEST OF THE AZORES.
 
THE GUIDANCE MODELS HAVE NOW SPLIT INTO TWO CAMPS...ONE WHICH
MOVES ARLENE NORTH/NORTHWEST (UKMET..AVN) AND ANOTHER WHICH
SHOWS AN INITIAL NORTHEAST (LBAR) OR NORTHWEST (BAMD) MOTION
FOLLOWED BY A SHARP TURN TO THE SOUTH/SOUTHWEST. THE GFDL
FOLLOWS THE FORMER SOLUTION THROUGH 24 HOURS BEFORE TURNING
WEST. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UKMET THEY ALL AGREE ON A SLOW
FORWARD MOTION. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE

ARLENE HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED THIS EVENING.  THE
CDO IS STILL IN PLACE AND CENTER APPEARS TO BE EMBEDDED IN IT.  THE
SYSTEM MAINTAINS GOOD UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW AND HAS NOT BEEN SHEARED
BY APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL WESTERLIES.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE NOW 55 KT AND 45 KT...RESPECTIVELY AND AIR
FORCE GLOBAL IS AT 35 KT.  TAFB METEOROLOGIST HAS NOTED THAT
SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT MAIN INFLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS IS FROM THE
SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST AND LITTLE OR NO INFLOW FROM STABLE AIR IN HIGH
TO THE NORTH...WHICH HAS BLOCKED THE SYSTEM.  THIS MAY BE MAIN
REASON WHY ARLENE HAS BEEN ABLE TO INTENSIFY OVER THESE COOL SSTS. 
THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE RAISED TO 45 KT. ARLENE IS
INTENSIFYING AT THE RATE OF 5 KNOTS EVERY 6-HOURS SO 12 HOUR
FORECAST IS 55 KNOTS.  INTENSITY FORECAST TO 60 KNOTS AT 24 HOURS
AND HELD STEADY AT THIS VALUE.  HOWEVER...IF TREND CONTINUES...MAY
HAVE A HURRICANE IN 24 HOURS.
 
THE LATEST SATELLITE FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB SHOW THAT ARLENE
HAS BEEN WOBBLING NORTHWARD AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS 360/03
KNOTS. HOWEVER...LATEST IR ANIMATION SUGGESTS A WOBBLE TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHWEST.
 
GUIDANCE MODELS ARE STARTING TO AGREE ON DIRECTION OF MOTION FOR
ARLENE.  UKMET..AVN..NOGAPS..GFDL..BAMM AND BAMS MOVE SYSTEM SLOWLY
IN A GENERAL NORTHWEST TO WEST DIRECTION OUT TO 36 HOURS.  AFTER 36
HOURS...DIFFERENT ACCELERATIONS IN SPEED CAUSE TRACKS TO DIVERGE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE WITH A
NORTH/NORTHWEST DRIFT THROUGH 72 HOURS.

LOCATED NEAR THE NORTHWEST EDGE OF THE DENSE OVERCAST.  HOWEVER...
THERE ARE FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED BANDING FEATURES OVER THE EASTERN

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY HINTS THAT THE SHEAR MAY WEAKEN SLIGHTLY AHEAD

FROM THE PREVIOUS INTENSITY FORECASTS.

THE CENTER IS LOCATED SOMEWHAT TO THE WEST OF THE PREVIOUS...

THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE OBSERVED STRUCTURE OR
ESTIMATED INTENSITY OF THE TROPICAL STORM.  THE LOW-LEVEL
CIRCULATION CENTER REMAINS NEARLY EXPOSED NEAR THE WESTERN EDGE OF
THE DENSE OVERCAST.  DEEP CONVECTION WITHIN A SMALL CDO-LIKE FEATURE
HAS BEEN PULSATING DURING THE DAY.  AGAIN...THERE IS A SLIGHT
POSSIBILITY THAT THE WEST-NORTHWESTERLY VERTICAL SHEAR OVER THE AREA
MAY RELAX.  THUS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST ALLOWS FOR A SLIGHT INCREASE
IN INTENSITY DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  THIS IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR
THE LATEST STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...
SHIPS...OUTPUT. 

ARLENE HAS MOVED SLOWLY WESTWARD DURING THE LAST SIX HOURS OR SO. 
THE STORM HAS BEEN EMBEDDED WITHIN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE AND UNABLE TO MOVE MUCH TOWARD THE NORTH.  HOWEVER...GUIDANCE
MODELS SUGGEST THAT ENOUGH OF A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE WILL DEVELOP
SO AS TO ALLOW A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
IN FACT...THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ITS
PREDECESSOR AND TURNS ARLENE NORTHWEST AND NORTH IN TWO TO THREE
DAYS.  THE U.K. MET. OFFICE MODEL TURNS THE CYCLONE NORTHWARD EVEN
SOONER.  THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST SHOWS A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST AND
IS IN BETWEEN THE LATEST MEDIUM BAM AND AVN MODEL TRACKS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/04.  THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL
CONTINUES TO SHOW THE STORM EMBEDDED IN A RIDGE.  GUIDANCE MODELS
ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT A SLOW NORTHWEST TO NORTHWARD
MOTION FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED A
SMIDGEON TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AS ARE THE NOGAPS
AND GFDL MODELS COMPARED TO THEIR PREVIOUS RUNS.  A TROUGH IN THE
WESTERLIES IS FORECAST TO MOVE NORTH OF THE STORM IN THE NEXT THREE
DAYS AND COULD CAUSE SOME NORTHWARD ACCELERATION NEAR THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD...AND THIS IS INDICATED BY THE UKMET MODEL BUT NOT
BY THE NOGAPS OR GFDL.
 
WESTERLY SHEAR CONTINUES TO IMPINGE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE STORM
AND DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE DOWN TO 3.0 CURRENT INTENSITY
NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB.  THE KGWC ESTIMATE IS 2.5.  U.S. NAVY AND
ECMWF SSM/I AND SCATTEROMETER WIND SPEEDS AROUND THE STORM SHOW WIND
SPEEDS OF LESS THAN 50 KNOTS.  SO THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS
DECREASED 5 KNOTS TO 45 KNOTS ON THIS BASIS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
WIND SPEEDS ARE ALSO DECREASED 5 KNOTS FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
IN AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS AND GFLD GUIDANCE.
 
THE CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED AT 1000
MB IS INCREASED TO 1009 MB BASED ON SHIP REPORTS WHICH SHOW
SURROUNDING PRESSURES TO BE RATHER HIGH.

ARLENE CONTINUES MOVING WEST WITH THE INITIAL MOTION OF 275/05.
LARGER SCALE GUIDANCE IS IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT...WITH BROAD
LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGING NORTHEAST OF ARLENE PRODUCING A GRADUAL TURN
TO THE NORTHWEST/NORTH DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THIS WOULD TAKE
THE CENTER OF ARLENE NEAR OR EAST OF BERMUDA. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE
IS MORE DIVERSE...WITH THE BAMS PASSING JUST NORTH OF BERMUDA...THE
GFDL AND BAMM PASSING JUST SOUTH OF BERMUDA...AND THE BAMD...A98E
AND LBAR MAINTAINING A WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OVERALL GUIDANCE AND
SHIFTED SOMEWHAT TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK.

CONVECTION HAS INCREASED NEAR THE CENTER DURING THE NIGHT...
ALTHOUGH THE CENTER REMAINS PARTIALLY EXPOSED DUE TO WESTERLY SHEAR.
THE LATEST INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 45 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND 2.5
FROM AFWA. THE CURRENT INTENSITY REMAINS AT 45 KT.

THE QUESTION NOW IS HOW MUCH SHEAR WILL ARLENE ENCOUNTER? THE LATEST
WATER VAPOR WINDS SUGGEST 10-20 KT WESTERLIES WEST OF THE CENTER...
WITH THE SHIPS MODEL INDICATING LESS THAN 15 KT OF SHEAR THROUGH 48
HOURS. AVAILABLE GLOBAL MODELS ALSO SUGGEST A DECREASE IN SHEAR...
WITH A UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DIGGING WEST OF BERMUDA BUILDING A RIDGE
NEAR ARLENE. BASED ON THIS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS A LITTLE
STRONGER THAN IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. THE MODELS INDICATE STRONG
NORTHERLY SHEAR DEVELOPING NEAR ARLENE BY 72 HOURS...WHICH IN
COMBINATION WITH COOLER SSTS SHOULD WEAKEN THE SYSTEM BY THAT TIME.
 
WIND RADII AT THE 36-72 HOUR FORECAST TIMES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED
ON THE PREDICTED NORTHWARD TURN AND HIGH PRESSURE TO THE EAST.

WATCHES OR WARNINGS FOR BERMUDA WILL NEED TO BE CONSIDERED LATER
TODAY.

11 AM EDT MON JUN 14 1999
 
ARLENE CONTINUES MOVING WEST WITH AN INITIAL MOTION OF 280/05.
LARGER SCALE GUIDANCE IS IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT...WITH BROAD
LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGING NORTHEAST OF ARLENE PRODUCING A GRADUAL TURN
TO THE NORTHWEST...THEN NORTH...DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THIS
WOULD TAKE THE CENTER OF ARLENE NEAR OR EAST OF BERMUDA.  NHC
HURRICANE GUIDANCE IS MORE DIVERSE...WITH THE BAMS PASSING JUST EAST
OF BERMUDA...AND THE GFDL AND BAMM PASSING JUST SOUTH.  THE GFDL IN
FACT BRINGS THE STRONGEST WINDS OVER THE ISLAND.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS VERY CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND THE SHALLOW BAM.
THE 36 HOUR POSITION IS WITHIN 120 MILES OF BERMUDA...NECESSITATING
A TROPICAL STORM WATCH AT THIS TIME.
 
CONVECTION HAS BEEN FAIRLY STEADY THIS MORNING...ALTHOUGH THE CENTER
REMAINS MOSTLY EXPOSED DUE TO WESTERLY SHEAR.  THE LATEST INTENSITY
ESTIMATES ARE 45 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND SO THE CURRENT INTENSITY
REMAINS AT 45 KT.  THE SHIPS AND AVN MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE SHEAR
MAY LESSEN TEMPORARILY DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THE COMBINATION OF
INCREASED SHEAR AND COOLER SSTS LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD
DICTATES ONLY MINIMAL STRENGTHENING IN THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY
FORECAST.

ARLENE HAS BEGUN A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST WITH THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE NOW 310/5.  MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT
ARLENE SHOULD PASS TO THE EAST OF BERMUDA...WITH A VERY TIGHT
CLUSTERING OF THE GFDL...AND THE SHALLOW AND MEDIUM BAMS.  THE
NOGAPS IS AN OUTLIER WITH RAPID MOTION TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND VERY CLOSE TO
THE GFDL.
 
LOW-LEVEL CLOUD-DRIFT WINDS IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT OF ARLENE FROM
THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS HAVE BEEN USED TO HELP ESTIMATE
THE WIND RADII.  CONVECTION HAS BEEN MAINTAINING ITSELF ON THE
EASTERN SIDE OF AN EXPOSED CENTER.  THE LATEST INTENSITY ESTIMATES
REMAIN 45 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...AND SO THE CURRENT INTENSITY IS
UNCHANGED.  IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE INTENSITY HAS REMAINED
RELATIVELY CONSTANT OVER THE LAST DAY OR SO...IMPLYING THAT THE
ENVIRONMENTAL SHEAR HAS BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO INHIBIT STRENGTHENING
BUT NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DISSIPATE THE CYCLONE.  THE SHIPS AND AVN
MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE SHEAR MAY LESSEN TEMPORARILY DURING THE NEXT
24 HOURS.  THE COMBINATION OF INCREASED SHEAR AND COOLER SSTS LATER
IN THE FORECAST PERIOD DICTATES ONLY MINIMAL STRENGTHENING IN THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST.

THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS EXPOSED WITH DEEP CONVECTION LOCATED WELL TO
THE EAST.  THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE LOW LEVEL CENTERS AS SAB AND TAFB
POSITION ESTIMATES ARE 50 NMI APART.  THIS HAS HAD THE EFFECT OF THE
MOTION APPEARING TO BE ERRATIC OVER THE PAST 6 HOURS.  GOING WITH
THE TAFB POSITION GIVES A MOTION OF 300/04 OVER THE LAST 12 HOURS.
THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL IS NOT YET AVAILABLE.  THE 12Z RUN SHOWS A
MAJOR TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES MOVING TO THE U.S. EAST COAST IN 72
HOURS AND THE GUIDANCE MODELS RESPOND BY TURNING THE STORM NORTHWARD
WITH CONTINUED RATHER SLOW MOTION.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS
AN UPDATE OF...AND SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THIS BRINGS
THE CENTER TO WITHIN 60 NMI OF BERMUDA IN ABOUT 48 HOURS AND A
TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS A GOOD IDEA.
 
DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES AND U.S. NAVY FNMOC SSM/I WIND SPEEDS
INDICATE MAX WINDS HAVE DECREASED TO 40 KNOTS.  THE SHIPS GUIDANCE
MODEL SHOWS SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IN THE NEXT 72 HOURS AND SO DOES
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE LOW LEVEL CENTER OF ARLENE IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE IN IR IMAGERY.
THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE POSITION IS A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS
ESTIMATES. SOME FURTHER RE-LOCATION MAY BE NECESSARY WHEN VISIBLE
IMAGERY AND RECONNAISSANCE REPORTS ARRIVE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED AT 285/04...A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO INDICATE A GRADUAL
TURN TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH...WITH CONTINUED DISAGREEMENT AS
TO WHETHER ARLENE WILL PASS EAST OR WEST OF BERMUDA. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SHIFTED TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND TAKES
THE CENTER OVER BERMUDA. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE 00Z GFDL IS
MUCH FASTER TURNING ARLENE NORTHWARD THAN THE 18Z RUN AND THUS LOOKS
A LITTLE SUSPECT. 
 
EVEN WITH THE DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING THE CENTER...IT REMAINS EXPOSED
WEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION. THE SHEAR HAS LESSENED TO THE POINT
WHERE ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE DEEP CONVECTION. 
HOWEVER...THERE IS STILL ENOUGH SHEAR TO HAMPER INTENSIFICATION.
THE INTENSITY FORECAST CONTINUES TO CALL FOR SLIGHT STRENGTHENING
ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...THERE IS A
POSSIBILITY THAT ARLENE MAY MEET STRONG SHEAR BEYOND 48 HOURS AND
WEAKEN.
 
AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS ENROUTE AND
IS SCHEDULED TO REACH ARLENE AROUND 11Z. 

A TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR BERMUDA. THE AIRCRAFT
DATA SHOULD HELP DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS
AROUND THE CENTER...AND THUS WHEN WARNINGS MAY BE REQUIRED.

AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT AND SATELLITE FIXES THIS
MORNING INDICATE THAT ARLENE HAS MOVED LITTLE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL
HOURS...AND THE CENTER MAY BE REFORMING CLOSER TO THE DEEP
CONVECTION.  

ARLENE IS IN A VERY WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT CUTOFF FROM THE
WESTERLY FLOW TO THE NORTH OF THE CYCLONE.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND
THE GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE WEST OF
ARLENE WILL DIG SOUTHWARD STRONGLY OVER THE NEXT 36 HOURS.  BEYOND
THAT...A SECOND TROUGH APPROACHING THE U.S. EAST COAST AT 72 HOURS
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO RECURVE ARLENE.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS A LITTLE
SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...WITH THE MEDIUM BAM TAKING ARLENE
TO THE WEST OF BERMUDA...AND THE GFDL TO THE EAST.  OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS TRACK BUT SLOWER...AND A BLEND
OF THE GFDL AND MEDIUM BAM.  WITH THE SLOWER INITIAL MOTION...A
TROPICAL STORM WARNING FOR BERMUDA IS NOT YET NECESSARY.
 
ALTHOUGH SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 2.5 AND
3.0...RESPECTIVELY...RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT FOUND 51 KT AT A FLIGHT
LEVEL OF 1000 FT.  WITH THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER CLOSER TO THE
CONVECTION...CURRENT INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 45 KT.  SHIPS AND AVN
INDICATE THAT THE SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM IS DECREASING AND SO
INTENSITY IS FORECAST TO INCREASE TO 55 KT IN 24 HOURS.  LONGER
TERM...COOLER SSTS AND INCREASING SHEAR WILL WEAKEN THE CYCLONE.

SATELLITE IMAGERY DURING THE AFTERNOON INDICATES THAT ARLENE IS ONCE
AGAIN LOSING ITS BATTLE WITH SHEAR...WITH A LOW-LEVEL CENTER EXPOSED
TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB
AND SAB ARE 3.0...AND THE INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 45 KT.  AN
AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN THE CYCLONE
AGAIN EARLY THIS EVENING TO SEE WHETHER THE WINDS HAVE DECREASED. 
THE SHEAR IS FORECAST TO CHANGE FROM SOUTHWESTERLY TO NORTHEASTERLY
OVER THE NEXT 36 H...IMPLYING A BRIEF INTERVAL OF FAVORABLE
CONDITIONS...BUT THIS WILL PROBABLY BE TOO BRIEF TO ALLOW
SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.  LONGER TERM...THE INCREASING SHEAR AND
COOLER SSTS SHOULD PROVE FATAL.

AFTER REMAINING ALMOST STATIONARY THIS MORNING...ARLENE HAS RESUMED
A SLOW MOTION TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE CENTER IS VERY BROAD AND POORLY
DEFINED...BUT OUR BEST INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 325/3.  THERE WAS
NO 12Z GFDL TODAY...BUT REMAINING GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT ARLENE WILL
REMAIN EAST OF BERMUDA.  OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT
OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE TOWARD THE SHALLOW BAM...IN ANTICIPATION OF
A MOSTLY SHEARED SYSTEM.

A USAF RESERVE AIRCRAFT FIXED THE STORM RECENTLY.  BASED ON THIS FIX
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/03 ALTHOUGH THE LOW LEVEL CENTER
IS NOT THAT WELL DEFINED.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES
ACCELERATION TOWARD THE NORTH AFTER 48 HOURS AS A MAJOR TROUGH
APPROACHES.  ONLY THE NOGAPS REMAINS SLOW WESTNORTHWESTWARD THROUGH
72 HOURS AND THIS WAS FROM THE 12Z RUN.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SHIFTED A SMIDGEON TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND
ACELLERATES THE STORM TO 12 KNOTS AFTER 48 HOURS.

THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED 55 KNOTS AT 1500 FEET ALTITUDE IN THE
NORTHEAST QUADRANT AND DVORAK T NUMBERS ARE 3.0 FROM TAFB AND SAB. 
SO THE WIND SPEED IS INCREASED TO 50 KNOTS ON THIS BASIS.  OTHERWISE
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY EXCEPT
FOR ADDING 5 KNOTS AT ALL FORECAST PERIODS AND CALLS FOR GRADUAL
WEAKENING IN 36 HOURS AS COLDER SSTS ARE ENCOUNTERED.

THE 34 KNOTS RADIUS IS INCREASED TO 125 NMI IN THE NORTHEAST
QUADRANT BASED ON AIRCRAFT DATA.  THIS IS EXTENDED TO THE NORTHWEST
QUADRANT IN 24 HOURS AS SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THE DEEP CONVECTION
ROTATING CYCLONICALLY AROUND THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE STORM.

BERMUDA IS RETAINING THE TROPICAL STORM WATCH FOR THIS ADVISORY.

5 AM EDT WED JUN 16 1999

DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH ARLENE HAS DECREASED DURING THE
NIGHT...AND IS ALSO LESS WIDESPREAD AND VIGOROUS THAN 24 HOURS AGO.
THIS COULD MEAN THE START OF A WEAKENING TREND. SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA REMAIN AT 45 KT. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 50 KT...ALTHOUGH THE NEW HURRICANE HUNTER
PLANE DUE INTO THE STORM AROUND 12Z MAY VERY WELL FIND A WEAKER
SYSTEM.

ALTHOUGH CIRRUS IS OBSCURING THE LOW LEVEL CENTER...ARLENE APPEARS
TO BE MOVING 300/4 KT. THE STORM IS SLOWLY CURVING AROUND THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC. ALL GUIDANCE
MODELS AGREE ON A GRADUAL ACCELERATION OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS IN
RESPONSE TO A WESTERLY TROUGH MOVING OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS THIS...ALTHOUGH IT IS A LITTLE SLOWER
THAN THE GUIDANCE DUE TO THE MODELS MOVING ARLENE TOO QUICKLY
NORTHWARD FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS PROBLEMATICAL. CONVECTION HAS DECREASED
EVEN THOUGH THE ENVIRONMENT APPEARS RELATIVELY FAVORABLE. NORTHERLY
SHEAR SHOULD DEVELOP OVER ARLENE IN THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS WHICH
SHOULD CAUSE WEAKENING. HOWEVER...MODEL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THE SHEAR
MAY NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO CAUSE RAPID WEAKENING. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR THE SAME WEAKENING AS THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...
EXCEPT TO MAKE ARLENE EXTRATROPICAL BY 72 HOURS.

FORECAST WIND RADII HAVE BEEN CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE ON
THE BASIS OF THE FORECAST MOTION...AND THE EXPECTATION THAT THE
NORTHERLY SHEAR WILL SUPPRESS CONVECTION IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT.

AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE PLANE FOUND HIGHEST WINDS AROUND 40 KNOTS IN
THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT AT A FLIGHT LEVEL OF 1100 FEET...AND THE
CENTRAL PRESSURE IS NOW UP TO 1015 MB.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS VERY
LITTLE...IF ANY...DEEP CONVECTION.  THESE OBSERVATIONS IMPLY THAT
ARLENE IS BARELY OF TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH.  THE SYSTEM IS IN AN
AREA OF CONFLUENT UPPER-LEVEL FLOW TO THE NORTH OF A LARGE UPPER-
LEVEL CYCLONE TO ITS SOUTH...AND THE ASSOCIATED SUBSIDENCE MAY BE
INHIBITING THE REDEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION.  VERTICAL SHEAR APPEARS
TO BE INCREASING OVER THE AREA AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE
MARGINAL.  THEREFORE... FURTHER WEAKENING IS LIKELY.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST CALLS FOR A DISSIPATING CYCLONE IN 48 HOURS.

FORWARD MOTION HAS SLOWED TO A DRIFT BUT TRACK GUIDANCE INDICATES A
MOSTLY NORTHWARD MOTION DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS WITH A
GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHEAST THEREAFTER.  THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH A MOVEMENT AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL
ANTICYCLONE...AND IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR TO THE SHALLOW-LAYER BAM

ARLENE IS NOW A SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS WITH LIMITED CONVECTION WELL
SOUTH OF THE CENTER. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...
SAB...AND AFWA HAVE ALL DROPPED BELOW TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH. BASED
ON THIS AND THE PREVIOUS RECONNAISSANCE DATA...ARLENE IS DOWNGRADED
TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION. FURTHER WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS ARLENE
MOVES NORTH OVER COLDER SSTS...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST HAS THE
SYSTEM DISSIPATING AT 48 HOURS.

THE FORWARD MOTION HAS INCREASED THE PAST FEW HOURS AND IS NOW
345/8. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE FROM EITHER THE PREVIOUS FORECAST OR
THE FORECAST REASONING. ARLENE SHOULD TURN NORTH AND THEN NORTH-
NORTHEAST IN THE FLOW BETWEEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE EAST AND
A DEVELOPING FRONTAL LOW OFF THE NEW ENGLAND STATES...WITH A STEADY
ACCELERATION THROUGH 48 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE

TROPICAL DEPRESSION THREE DISCUSSION NUMBER   1
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT WED AUG 18 1999

RECONNAISSANCE AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT A CLOSED
CIRCULATION HAS FORMED OVER THE BAY OF CAMPECHE.  THEREFORE
ADVISORIES ARE BEING INITIATED.

INITIAL MOTION IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS STILL IN
THE DEVELOPING STAGE AND PREVIOUS CENTER FIXES SHOW A LOT OF
SCATTER.  MY BEST ESTIMATE IS WEST-NORTHWEST NEAR 7 KNOTS AT THIS
TIME.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A RETROGRESSION OF THE MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE SOUTH-CENTRAL UNITED STATES...WITH A
WEAKNESS EXTENDING NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE SOUTHWEST GULF TO A
DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.  THIS COMPLICATES
THE TRACK FORECAST AND LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE COULD REMAIN OVER THE SOUTHWEST GULF FOR THE NEXT FEW
DAYS...DUE TO WEAK STEERING CURRENTS.  THIS IS SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST AS WELL.

THE DEPRESSION IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE SOME WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY
SHEARING DUE TO AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN GULF. 
THERE IS ALSO AN UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER THE
NORTH-CENTRAL GULF WHICH COULD BE IMPARTING SOME SHEAR.  EVEN THOUGH
THE SHEAR IS A NEGATIVE FACTOR FOR STRENGTHENING... THE ULTIMATE
EFFECT OF THE WEAK UPPER TROUGH ADJACENT TO THE DEPRESSION MAY BE TO
SPIN UP THE TROPICAL CYCLONE...AS SUGGESTED BY SOME RECENT RESEARCH. 
THE GLOBAL MODEL FORECAST SHOWS THESE UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC FEATURES
BECOMING MOSTLY INDISTINCT...WITH ANTICYCLONIC FLOW DEVELOPING OVER
THE AREA IN 2-3 DAYS.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS LITTLE
CHANGE IN STRENGTH EARLY IN THE PERIOD FOLLOWED BY SOME MODEST
INTENSIFICATION.  THIS ASSUMES THAT THE SYSTEM WILL REMAIN OVER
WATER THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.

THREE REMAINS ILL-DEFINED WITH A CHAOTIC CONVECTIVE PATTERN. THE

HOWEVER...AS MENTIONED IN THE LAST ADVISORY THE CENTER LOCATION 
REMAINS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.  A U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT IS ENROUTE TO INVESTIGATE THE SYSTEM AND WILL AID IN
DETERMINING THE LOCATION OF THE CENTER.     
 
THE OOZ AVN MODEL CONTINUES THE TREND FROM EARLIER RUNS OF 
RETROGRADING THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE SOUTH-CENTRAL
UNITED STATES...WITH A RESULTING WEAKNESS STRETCHING NORTHEASTWARD
FROM THE SOUTHWEST GULF TO A DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN
UNITED STATES.  THE GFDI AND AVN TRACKS GO IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS...
THE AVN EAST AND THE GFDI WEST-SOUTHWEST THEN SOUTH-SOUTHEAST INTO

CENTERED ON A WEST-NORTHWESTERLY COURSE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS
A SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING THROUGH 72 HRS...REPRESENTING A SLIGHT
NORTHWARD ADJUSTMENT TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE DUE TO THE INITIAL
POSITION. 

THE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR DUE TO
THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN GULF. THE GLOBAL

FUNNELING. BASED ON THIS...AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 30

10 NM FROM THE CENTER. THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE SET TO 50 KT FOR THIS
ADVISORY.

BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT DATA...THE INITIAL MOTION IS 360/06. WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY AND LARGE SCALE MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES AN UPPER
TROUGH OVER SOUTH TEXAS AND NORTHEAST MEXICO OVERLYING A LOW/MID
LEVEL RIDGE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE IS
SCATTERED. THE NHC98 AND CLIPER...THE BEST VERIFYING ON THE CURRENT
NORTHWARD MOTION...CONTINUE A SLOW NORTHWARD MOTION THROUGH 48
HOURS. THE BAM MODELS...LBAR...AND NHC90UK ALL TURN THE STORM
WESTWARD TOWARD THE MEXICAN COAST. THE GFDL...WHICH HAS HAD PROBLEMS
WITH RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY...TURNS BRET BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A BLEND OF THE CURRENT MOTION AND A LATER
NORTHWESTWARD TURN...AND IS SHIFTED NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER BRET IS PROVIDING GOOD OUTFLOW WITH LIGHT
SHEAR. THE SHIPS MODEL BRINGS THE CYCLONE TO HURRICANE STRENGTH IN
LESS THAN 24 HOURS AND TO 90 KT IN 48 HOURS. THE INTENSITY FORECAST
IS A LITTLE MORE CONSERVATIVE...BUT STILL MAKES BRET A HURRICANE IN
LESS THAN 24 HOURS.

WITH THE CURRENTLY NORTHERLY MOTION AND THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE
FORECAST...ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE TEXAS COAST SHOULD MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF BRET OVER THE WEEKEND.

SATELLITE ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE NOW 65 KT.  AIR FORCE AND
NOAA AIRCRAFT REPORTS THIS EVENING INDICATE THAT THE MINIMUM
PRESSURE IN BRET CONTINUES TO DROP...WITH THE MOST RECENT REPORT OF
981 MB...DOWN 11 MB IN 8 HOURS.  A GPS DROPWINDSONDE IN THE NORTH
EYEWALL REPORTED SURFACE WINDS OF 62 KT.  WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT
THE DROPSONDE DID NOT MEASURE THE ABSOLUTE PEAK WINDS IN THE
STORM...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS SET AT 65 KT...MAKING BRET THE
FIRST HURRICANE OF THE 1999 ATLANTIC SEASON.  PRESSURE FALLS IN BRET
HAVE BEEN PRECEDING WIND INCREASES...AND WE EXPECT THAT BRET WILL
CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST IS CLOSE TO
THE SHIPS MODEL GUIDANCE AND SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 355/8...A BIT FASTER TO THE NORTH.  MOST
GUIDANCE IS SHIFTED A LITTLE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...THE
GFDL DRAMATICALLY SO.  THE AVN SUGGESTS THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH
MID-LEVEL RIDGING NORTH OF BRET TO TURN THE HURRICANE TO THE
NORTHWEST.  OF INTEREST IS THE UKMET...WHICH IS TO THE RIGHT OF MOST
OF THE GUIDANCE AND SUGGESTS A LANDFALL IN SOUTHERN TEXAS.  THIS
MODEL HAS DONE FAIRLY WELL WITH THIS SYSTEM SO FAR AND CANNOT BE
DISCOUNTED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST STILL INDICATES A LANDFALL ALONG
THE NORTH COAST OF MEXICO...BUT HAS BEEN ADJUSTED SOMEWHAT TO THE
NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON AIR FORCE RESERVE
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM AN ARRAY OF
GPS DROPWINDSONDES.  THESE SONDES WERE RELEASED FROM A NOAA
P-3 AIRCRAFT DURING A RESEARCH MISSION OF THE HURRICANE RESEARCH
DIVISION.  THE NEW WIND RADII ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE NORTHWARD
TRANSLATION OF BRET.
 
ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE TEXAS COAST SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 340/07.  THE 06Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS
A SUBSTANTIAL 500 MB HIGH HOLDING STEADY IN THE VICINITY OF NEW
MEXICO FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS AND THIS SHOULD CAUSE A SLOWING OF THE
NORTHWARD MOTION AND/OR A TURN TOWARD THE WEST.  THE GFDL MODEL
SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE WEST WITH THE CENTER AT THE COAST NEAR THE
TEXAS MEXICO BORDER IN 36 HOURS.  THE UKMET HAS A SIMILAR TRACK BUT
MUCH SLOWER AND THE NOGAPS KEEPS BRET ABOUT STATIONARY FOR 72 HOURS.
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AND HAS THE CENTER AT THE COAST IN 36 HOURS.  THIS MAY BE A
LITTLE FAST BUT IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL MODEL.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK BRINGS 34 KNOT WINDS TO THE COAST IN ABOUT 24
HOURS...DEPENDING ON THE GALE RADIUS IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT WHICH
IS ONLY ABOUT 60 NMI AT THIS TIME...BUT WHICH COULD EXPAND IN THE
NEXT 24 HOURS.  SO IT IS TIME TO PUT UP HURRICANE WARNINGS...FROM LA
PESCA MEXICO TO BAFFIN BAY TEXAS.

THE HIGHEST RECON WIND SPEED THIS MORNING IS 92 KNOTS JUST NORTHEAST
OF THE CENTER.  THE LATEST CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE IS 978 MB.  THE
OFFICIAL WIND SPEED AND FORECAST IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...INCREASING THE WIND SPEED TO 105 KNOTS BEFORE LANDFALL. 
THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL TAKES THE WIND TO 110 KNOTS.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 345/07.  THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL RUN
SHOWS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE LARGE SCALE FEATURES INFLUENCING THE
MOTION WITH AN ANTICYCLONE ANCHORED IN THE VICINITY OF NEW MEXCIO
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  THE TRACK MODELS HAVE ALSO CHANGED LITTLE.
THE GFDL MODEL IS THE FASTEST WITH THE CENTER AT THE COAST NEAR THE

SOUTHWESTWARD TURN.  THE AVIATION AND BAM MODELS ALSO SHOW THE TURN
CONTINUING AROUND TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A
LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE GFDL BUT FASTER THAN ALL THE OTHER MODELS AND
KEEPS THE LANDFALL LOCATION NEAR THE BORDER IN 24 TO 36 HOURS.
 
THE LATEST SURFACE PRESSURE FROM RECONNAISSANCE IS 976 MB AND THEY
REPORTED 101 KNOTS AT 850 MB JUST NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  ALSO A
GPS DROP SHOWED A WIND MAX OF 112 KNOTS AT 900 MB IN THE EYEWALL

11 PM EDT SAT AUG 21 1999
 
TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED TONIGHT. FIRST...BRET HAS RAPIDLY
INTENSIFIED TO A CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE
AND THIS IS BASED ON WINDS FROM GPS DROPSONDES RELEASED IN THE
EYEWALL BY THE NOAA RECONNAISSANCE PLANE. WINDS TO 135 KNOTS WERE
MEASURED BY THE SONDES AT 60 METERS ELEVATION. THIS CORRESPONDS TO A
SURFACE WIND OF 115 KNOTS. WINDS OF 149 KNOTS WERE MEASURED AT 888
MB.
 
SECOND...BRET HAS CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHWARD AND FASTER...ABOUT 9 TO
12 KNOTS. THIS INCREASES THE RISK FOR RESIDENTS ALONG THE TEXAS
COAST.  WATCHES AND WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.
 
A MIDDLE-LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN
UNITED STATES.  IF THIS MATERIALIZES...THE RIDGE SHOULD BLOCK THE
NORTHWARD MOTION OF THE HURRICANE AND FORCE IT TO THE WEST. THIS IS
THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF THE TRACK AND GLOBAL MODELS.
THEREFORE...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SLOWS BRET DOWN AND GRADUALLY
TURNS IT TO THE WEST. ON THIS TRACK...THE CENTER OF THE HURRICANE
WILL BE NEAR THE COAST WITHIN THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 24 TO 36
HOURS.  WEATHER CONDITIONS SHOULD BEGIN TO DETERIORATE WELL BEFORE
THAT TIME.
 
DATA CURRENTLY BEING OBTAINED BY THE NOAA GULFSTREAM JET WILL BE
USED IN THE NEXT CYCLE OF NUMERICAL MODELS.

LATEST REPORTS FROM THE HURRICANE HUNTERS SUGGEST THAT BRET MAY HAVE
STRENGTHENED A LITTLE FURTHER...WITH THE DROPSONDE-MEASURED CENTRAL
PRESSURE DOWN TO 948 MB.  BRETS APPEARANCE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY IS
NOT AS SYMMETRIC AS IT WAS EARLIER.  AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH JUST TO
THE WEST OF THE HURRICANE MAY BE CAUSING SOME EROSION OF THE CLOUD
SHIELD OVER THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE.  NOTWITHSTANDING...THE INNER
CORE OF BRET APPEARS TO BE UNAFFECTED.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY MAY OCCUR BUT CATEGORY FOUR INTENSITY IS FORECAST TO BE
MAINTAINED UNTIL LANDFALL.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS A MID-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONIC VORTEX NEAR
THE LOWER RIO GRANDE...AND THIS MAY HAVE PUSHED THE HURRICANE A
LITTLE MORE NORTHWARD THAN WAS EXPECTED. CENTER FIXES NOW INDICATE A
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION NEAR 9 KNOTS.  THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE SAMPLING
OF THE STEERING ENVIRONMENT AROUND BRET AND THESE DATA HAVE BEEN
INPUT INTO THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL. A WEAK MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE LIES
ALONG THE NORTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO COAST AND THE GLOBAL MODEL
FORECASTS THIS FEATURE TO PERSIST.  NOT SURPRISINGLY...THE CONSENSUS
OF THE TRACK PREDICTION MODELS IS FOR A TURN TO THE LEFT...TOWARD
THE SOUTH TEXAS COAST.   ONLY SLIGHT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE
PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK...AND NO NORTHWARD EXTENSION OF THE
WARNINGS IS DEEMED NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST...BASED ON THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE... SHOWS A
SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED.  IF THIS DOES NOT OCCUR THEN THE
CENTER WILL REACH THE COAST SOONER THAN INDICATED.  DO NOT FOCUS ON
THE EXACT TRACK.  EVEN THOUGH BRET IS EXPECTED TO MOVE ONSHORE IN
THE HURRICANE WARNING AREA...IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SPECIFY A PRECISE
POINT AND TIME OF LANDFALL.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 315/09 AND WE MAY BE SEEING THE
BEGINNING OF A TURN TOWARD THE WEST THAT MANY OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS
HAVE BEEN INDICATING FOR SOME TIME.  THE LATEST GUIDANCE CONTINUES
TO INDICATE THAT THE ANTICYCLONE TO THE NORTHWEST OF BRET WILL CAUSE
THE MOTION TO SLOW AND TURN LEFT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
CONTINUES THE INITIAL MOTION FOR 12 HOURS WHICH BRINGS THE CENTER TO
THE COAST.  AFTER THIS THE TRACK FORECAST SLOWS TO LESS THAN 5 KNOTS
WITH A MOSTLY WESTWARD HEADING.  THIS IS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH
THE GFDL MODEL.

THE LATEST RECON CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 944 MB AND WIND
REPORTS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A 120 KNOT HURRICANE.  NO IMPORTANT
CHANGES ARE EXPECTED BEFORE LANDFALL...BUT THERE WILL LIKELY BE
FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY.

DATA BUOY 42020 REPORTED 35 KNOTS FOR THE FIRST TIME AT 12Z WHEN THE

BRET HAS MADE LANDFALL ALONG THE SOUTH TEXAS COAST MIDWAY BETWEEN
BROWNSVILLE AND CORPUS CHRISTI. ESTIMATED WINDS OF 90 TO 100 MPH
HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AT THE BROWNSVILLE FORECAST OFFICE IN KENNEDY
COUNTY NEAR WHERE THE CROSSED THE COAST. GPS DROPSONDE DATA FROM 
THE U.S. AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATE THAT BRET 
HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS. THE LAST MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED WAS 952 MB...AND USING THE GPS WIND DATA
THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE REDUCED TO 100 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  FURTHER
WEAKENING SHOULD CONTINUE AS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE MOVES SLOWLY
INLAND WITH BRET FORECAST TO WEAKEN BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 
12 HRS.  

RECONNAISSANCE AND WSR-88D RADAR DATA INDICATE THAT BRET HAS SLOWED
DOWN SOMEWHAT DURING THE LAST 6 HOURS AND IS NOW ON A MORE WESTERLY
COURSE...WITH THE INITIAL MOTION OF 280/06 KT.  THE PHILOSOPHY
REGARDING TRACK OF HURRICANE BRET REMAINS UNCHANGED WITH THE MID-
LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE SHOULD PROVIDE A WESTWARD
STEERING COMPONENT THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS 
A GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION THROUGH 72 HRS WITH A GRADUAL DECELERATION
...THIS IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT WITH BAMD. 

AS A RESULT OF THE SLOW FORWARD MOTION...THE PRIMARY THREAT BRET
WILL POSE THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL BE HEAVY RAINS. RAINFALL
TOTALS OF 10 TO 15 INCHES...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS...ARE
POSSIBLE OVER PORTIONS SOUTH TEXAS AND NORTHERN MEXICO. FURTHER

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM CDT MON AUG 23 1999
 
SINCE LANDFALL...BRET HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE 280/5 ACROSS KENEDY
COUNTY INTO BROOKS COUNTY TEXAS. WSR-88D DATA FROM CORPUS CHRISTI
AND BROWNSVILLE SHOW THE EYE HAS FILLED...ALTHOUGH INFRARED
SATELLITE IMAGERY AT 0745Z STILL SHOWED A HINT OF AN EYE. DOPPLER
WINDS FROM THE RADARS HAVE BEEN STEADILY DECREASING...AND THIS DATA
IS THE BASIS FOR THE 75 KT INITIAL INTENSITY.
 
THERE IS LITTLE TO SAY ABOUT BRET TRACKWISE. THE CYCLONE IS MOVING
WESTWARD UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. RIDGE...AND
THIS GENERAL MOTION SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL DISSIPATION AT 48 HOURS.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...
CALLING FOR BRET TO SLOW TO 3 KT AFTER 24 HOURS.
 
DUE THE SLOW FORWARD MOTION...BRET IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD
HEAVY RAINS OVER PORTIONS OF SOUTH TEXAS AND NORTHEAST MEXICO...WITH
ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OF 10-20 INCHES POSSIBLE. WSR-88D RAINFALL
ESTIMATES INDICATE AS MUCH AS 28 INCHES HAS ALREADY FALLEN OVER
PARTS OF KENEDY COUNTY. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE RAINFALL
THREAT CAN BE FOUND IN LOCAL NWS FORECAST OFFICE PRODUCTS.
 
THE NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED

CORRECTION TO HEADER...CHANGE SUBTROPICAL TO TROPICAL STORM

WIND REPORTS FROM ALICE AND CORPUS CHRISTI ALONG WITH DOPPLER RADAR
WINDS INDICATE THAT BRET IS NEAR MINIMAL STORM STRENGTH.  THE
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH IS TO KEEP TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH FOR A FEW
MORE HOURS.
 
THE MOTION HAS BEEN ROUGHLY 295/05 FOR THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE
TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS A SLOW MOSTLY WESTWARD MOTION UNTIL DISSIPATION
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.
 
THE BIG THING NOW IS RAINFALL.  RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS OF NEAR 10
INCHES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND 10 TO 15 INCHES OF ADDITION RAINFALL
ARE POSSIBLE WITH THIS SLOW MOVING SYSTEM.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVER THE LAST 6 HRS
WITH DEEP CONVECTION...TOPS TO -80C...SOUTH AND WEST OF THE
SUSPECTED LOW-LEVEL CENTER.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL NOT VERY WELL
ORGANIZED AND DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES REFLECT...25 KT FROM SAB
AND AFGW AND 35 KT FROM TAFB.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD 
AT 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY. THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE
EASTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ON THE ORDER OF 25-30 KT PER CLOUD
DRIFT WIND DATA.  THE STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION
SCHEME...SHIPS...CONTINUES TO INDICATE MODEST STRENGTHENING...50 KT
BY 72 HRS...LIMITED BY THE EASTERLY SHEAR CONDITIONS. SINCE THE
SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE HOLDING ITS OWN IN SPITE OF THE SHEAR...THE
INTENSITY TREND FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WILL BE MAINTAINED.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 280/13 KT WHICH REPRESENTS A SLIGHT
INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED FROM THE LAST ADVISORY.  HOWEVER...THERE
IS STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE CENTER LOCATION
AS DEMONSTRATED IN THE 45-60 NM SPREAD IN THE SATELLITE-BASED FIXES.
THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION WILL
PRODUCE A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS. THE 00Z AVN SUGGESTS THAT A WEAKNESS MAY DEVELOP TOWARDS THE
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A BEND TO
THE NORTH AND A DECELERATION BEYOND 48 HOURS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST 
TRACK IS SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF PREVIOUS PACKAGE PRIMARILY DUE TO

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR IS
NEAR TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH WITH THE LOW LEVEL CENTER NEAR THE
EASTERN EDGE OF THE CONVECTIVE MASS. HOWEVER...EASTERLY SHEAR
CONTINUES OVER THE SYSTEM AND THE CONVECTIVE CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED
SOME DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS. IF THE CONVECTION PERSISTS...THE
CYCLONE WILL LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM THIS AFTERNOON.

THERE IS STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF SCATTER IN THE SATELLITE-BASED
CENTER LOCATIONS...WHICH PRODUCE A BEST ESTIMATE OF THE MOTION OF
280/10. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO EITHER THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY OR
FORECAST TRACK FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. THE STRONG LOW LEVEL RIDGE
NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION SHOULD KEEP THE SYSTEM ON A WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWEST TRACK...WITH PERHAPS A SLIGHT BEND TO THE NORTH AFTER 48
HOURS DUE TO AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TO THE NORTHWEST.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOUR HAS MAINTAINED ITSELF AGAINST MODERATE TO
STRONG SHEAR. THE AVN...NOGAPS...AND ECMWF MODELS SUGGEST SOME
DECREASE IN THE SHEAR MAY OCCUR DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD...WHICH
WOULD ALLOW SOME STRENGTHENING. THE FORECAST TRACK TAKES THE CYCLONE
OVER 25C-26C WATER AFTER 36 HOURS...WHICH WOULD LIKELY SLOW OR HALT
INTENSIFICATION. THUS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS UNCHANGED FROM THE

TO A CIRRUS COVER OVER THE LOW LEVEL CENTER. THE EARLIER STRONG
CONVECTION HAS NOT PERSISTED...AND INSTEAD THERE IS BURSTING
CONVECTION CHARACTERISTIC OF A SHEARED SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 35 KT...THIS PACKAGE WILL

LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO...BUT A LITTLE SOUTH OF THE

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS ALSO SLIGHTLY CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS

WHAT LITTLE DATA THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION ARE
SENDING STRONGLY MIXED SIGNALS THIS EVENING.  SATELLITE AND
MICROWAVE IMAGERY...THE LATTER FROM THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY IN
MONTEREY CALIFORNIA...SUGGEST THAT THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION IS
SUFFERING FROM STRONG NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR.  RECENT IMAGES SHOW NO
CONVECTION CLOSE TO THE PRESUMED CENTER.  ON THE OTHER HAND...SHIP
4QUM REPORTED SOUTHWEST WINDS OF 45 KT AT 18Z AND 37 KT AT 00Z.  THE
SECOND REPORT WAS ABOUT 150 NM TO THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST OF THE SYSTEM. 
ALTHOUGH THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE ACCEPTED AS CORRECT...I BELIEVE THEY
REFLECT THE LARGE SCALE FLOW OF THE ITCZ...PERHAPS ENHANCED BY THE
DEPRESSION.  VISIBLE IMAGERY IN THE MORNING WILL DETERMINE WHETHER
THIS ANALYSIS IS CORRECT...OR WHETHER THERE IS A WELL DEFINED
TROPICAL CYCLONE CIRCULATION...WITH THE REQUIRED ORGANIZED
CONVECTION.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 275/8...AND THE TRACK FORECAST

BUT THE BANDING FEATURES ARE STILL NOT VERY WELL DEFINED.  DVORAK T-

INCREASED TO 50 KNOTS ON THIS ADVISORY.  NORTHEASTERLY SHEARING IS

WISCONSIN CIMSS WEB SITE INDICATE WEAKER SHEAR AHEAD.  CINDY IS
LIKELY TO BECOME A HURRICANE DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.

MOTION CONTINUES TOWARD THE WEST AT 9 TO 10 KNOTS.  THERE IS A
WEAKNESS IN THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC SUBTROPICAL RIDGE IN THE VICINITY
OF 30W...WHICH IS PROBABLY CAUSING THE SLOWER-THAN-CLIMATOLOGICAL
WESTWARD MOTION OF CINDY.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL FORECAST SHOWS THIS
WEAKNESS BECOMING LESS DISTINCT WITH TIME...WITH AN EAST-SOUTHEAST
TO WEST-NORTHWEST RIDGE AT 500 MB ORIENTED NORTH OF CINDY IN 2-3

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT CINDY IS UNDER STRONG
EASTERLY SHEAR.  THE CENTER IS EXPOSED AND LOCATED WELL TO THE EAST
OF THE CONVECTION BUT THE SYSTEM...AS A WHOLE...HAS A LARGE CYCLONIC
ENVELOPE.   BASED ON THE WEAKENING STRUCTURE OF THE CLOUD PATTERN...
CINDY IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM STATUS AT THIS TIME.
BECAUSE CINDY IS MOVING SLOWLY AND THE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE NOT
FORECAST TO CHANGE...RELATIVELY STRONG SHEAR WILL CONTINUE OVER THE
SYSTEM.  AT THIS TIME...WINDS ARE KEPT AT 55 KNOTS THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD.

THE CENTER HAS BEEN MOVING VERY SLOWLY WESTWARD...IT APPEARS THAT
THE SYSTEM IS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOW-LEVEL AFRICAN
MONSOON-TYPE FLOW. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALL FOR A SLOW WESTWARD
TRACK DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS WITH SOME INCREASE IN FORWARD
SPEED THEREAFTER. THIS IS BASICALLY THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF
THE TRACK AND GLOBAL MODELS.

EASTERLY SHEAR CONTINUES TO AFFECT CINDY.  ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER HAS RECENTLY BECOME MORE INVOLVED WITH THE
DEEP CONVECTION...WHICH WOULD IMPLY SOME RE-STRENGTHENING...THIS IS
NOT CERTAIN.  THEREFORE THE CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS KEPT AT 50

SHEAR.  ONCE THE STORM MOVES WEST OF ABOUT 40W LONGITUDE...I.E. MORE
INTO THE LOW-LEVEL EASTERLY TRADEWIND ENVIRONMENT...THE EASTERLY
SHEAR SHOULD DIMINISH SOMEWHAT.  HOWEVER BECAUSE OF OUR LIMITATIONS
IN PREDICTING INTENSITY CHANGE...ONLY SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IS SHOWN
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  

CENTER FIXES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE SOMEWHAT SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS
TRACK.  IT IS PRUDENT NOT TO MAKE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITH
INFRARED IMAGERY HOWEVER.  BASED ON CONTINUITY...IT IS PRESUMED THAT
THE CENTER IS NEAR THE EAST-NORTHEASTERN EDGE OF THE DENSE OVERCAST.
THIS GIVES AN ESTIMATED INITIAL MOTION OF 285/07...CLOSE TO THAT
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  

THE 00Z AVN RUN OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE BUILDING WESTWARD FROM THE EASTERN TO THE CENTRAL
ATLANTIC OVER THE NEXT 2-3 DAYS.  IF THIS VERIFIES...CINDY SHOULD
MAINTAIN A GENERAL WEST TO WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION DURING THE

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/09.  THE 12 AVIATION MODEL SHOWS
A SLIGHT WEAKNESS AHEAD OF THE STORM IN THE 500 MB RIDGE.  THIS IS
CAUSING ALL OF THE TRACK FORECAST MODELS TO CONTINUE A WEST-
NORTHWESTWARD MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS WITH SOME ACCELERATION.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE NORTH OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

THE STORM CONTINUES TO BE SHEARED WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION DISPLACED
TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER WHICH IS NOT VERY WELL
DEFINED.  SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF 50 KNOTS IS NOT CHANGED FOR 36
HOURS.  AT 48 AND 72 HOURS...THE FORECAST IS FOR SLIGHT
STRENGTHENING AS THE SHIPS MODEL FORECASTS A WEAKENING OF THE
VERTICAL SHEAR.

THE WIND SPEED RADII ARE ADJUSTED TO SHOW THE STRONGEST WINDS IN THE

SATELLITE FIXES ARE RATHER SCATTERED THIS MORNING...WITH A 90 MILE
SPREAD BETWEEN SAB...TAFB...AND AFWA.  I AM GOING WITH THE
AFWA...THE NORTHERNMOST.  THIS PUTS THE CENTER ON OR JUST OUTSIDE
THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION...AND THE INTENSITY IS HELD
AT 50 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT THE SHEAR WILL
DIMINISH IN ABOUT 24 HOURS.  ALSO AT ABOUT THIS TIME...CINDY WILL BE
MOVING OVER WARMER WATER.  SHIPS GUIDANCE STRENGTHENS CINDY TO 84 KT
IN 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A LITTLE MORE CONSERVATIVE AT
THIS TIME UNTIL THE SHEAR LESSENS. 

THE PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED ACCELERATION MAY BE DEVELOPING...AS THE
INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 285/13.  GIVEN THE SPREAD OF THIS MORNINGS
FIXES...THOUGH...I AM NOT CERTAIN OF THIS.  THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE NORTH OF CINDY IS STEERING THE CYCLONE ON A GENERAL
WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK.  THE TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS TIGHTLY CLUSTERED
ON A WEST-NORTHWEST TO GRADUALLY MORE NORTHWESTWARD TRACK AROUND THE

THE APPEARANCE OF CINDY HAS IMPROVED THIS AFTERNOON.  LATE THIS
MORNING A MID-LEVEL VORTEX IN THE CONVECTION WAS EVIDENT IN THE
VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION DEVELOPED
OVER THE VORTEX IN THE AFTERNOON.  WHILE THE LOCATION OF THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER IS STILL IN DOUBT...I BELIEVE IT IS...OR SOON WILL
BE...REFORMING UNDER THE NEW CONVECTION.  SSTS UNDER CINDY ARE NOW
27C...AND WILL CONTINUE TO WARM OVER TIME.  THERE IS STILL A LITTLE
NORTHERLY SHEAR WITH THIS SYSTEM BUT THIS SHOULD LESSEN OVER THE
NEXT 24 HOURS.  SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE BRINGS CINDY TO 86 KT IN 72
HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CONCURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 280/15.  THE MODEL GUIDANCE
IS NOT AS TIGHTLY CLUSTERED AS IT WAS EARLIER...WITH THE DEEP BAM ON
THE RIGHT GIVING A NET NORTHWEST MOTION OVER THE PERIOD...AND THE
GFDL AND LBAR ON THE LEFT WITH MORE OF A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION.  HOW
MUCH RECURVATURE WE GET WILL DEPEND ON THE BREAKDOWN OF THE MID-
ATLANTIC RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED A BIT TO THE LEFT
BASED ON THE TREND TO A MORE WESTWARD TRACK OVER THE PAST 24
HOURS...AND IS TOWARDS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE.

THE CENTER IS NOT WELL DEFINED IN SATELLITE IMAGERY...BUT IS
ESTIMATED NEAR THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST. 
INITIAL INTENSITY IS 55 KNOTS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB AND SAB.  IF THE CENTER IS ACTUALLY MORE CENTRALLY
EMBEDDED WITHIN THE CONVECTIVE OVERCAST THAN THOUGHT...THE INTENSITY
ESTIMATE WOULD BE HIGHER.  RELATIVELY LIGHT SHEAR IS FORECAST ALONG
THE TRACK AND THE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL WARM.   THEREFORE...
STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED.

INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/14.  THERE IS A LITTLE WEAKNESS IN
THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF CINDY...SO A GENERAL MOTION TOWARD THE
WEST-NORTHWEST OR EVEN NORTHWEST SHOULD CONTINUE.  OUR CURRENT
FORECAST TRACK IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS...AND IN BEST
AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL.  IF THE RIDGE WEAKENS SUBSTANTIALLY...THE

BASED ON DVORAK T-NUMBERS...CINDY HAS CHANGED LITTLE IN INTENSITY. 
HOWEVER THE CLOUD PATTERN APPEARS TO HAVE BECOME A LITTLE MORE
SYMMETRIC WHICH SUGGESTS THAT STRENGTHENING IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. 
THIS IS NOT SURPRISING SINCE THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS NOW FAIRLY WEAK
AND THE UNDERLYING WATERS ARE BECOMING WARMER.  THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY FORECAST IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE STATISTICAL
MODEL...SHIPS.

THE CENTER POSITION IS NOT OBVIOUS FROM INFRARED IMAGERY...BUT THERE
IS SOME SUGGESTION THAT THE STORM IS MOVING A BIT MORE
NORTHWESTWARD.  HOWEVER FOR THE SAKE OF CONTINUITY...THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOT ADJUSTED MUCH FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  AN
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IN THE VICINITY OF 55W NORTH OF 20N WOULD INDUCE
A MORE NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION IF IT REMAINS IN PLACE. 
HOWEVER THIS FEATURE IS LIKELY TO MIGRATE WESTWARD...AND WITH A
SUBSTANTIAL 500 MB RIDGE ALONG 30N TO THE NORTH OF CINDY...A
CONTINUED WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION IS LIKELY.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THIS IS
ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE AS WELL.

THERE ARE MIXED SIGNALS AS TO THE ORGANIZATION OF TROPICAL
DEPRESSION FIVE THIS MORNING. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB AND SAB ARE 35 KT AND 30 KT RESPECTIVELY...AND THIS IS
SUPPORTED BY A 35 KT REPORT FROM SHIP WZJF. HOWEVER...THE WIND
DIRECTION AT THIS SOUTH-SOUTHEASTWARD-MOVING SHIP IS UNCHANGED OVER
THE PAST SIX HOURS. THIS SUGGESTS A POORLY DEFINED OR ELONGATED
CIRCULATION. SHIP 3FOB5...LOCATED ABOUT 70 MILES WEST OF THE
ESTIMATED CENTER...SUPPORTS THIS IDEA BY REPORTING EAST WINDS 5 KT.
THE SYSTEM WILL REMAIN A DEPRESSION ON THIS PACKAGE. AN AIR FORCE
RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT WILL INVESTIGATE THE DEPRESSION
STARTING AT 12Z.

THERE ARE SEVERAL FEATURES BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CONVECTION
THAT LOOK LIKE CENTERS...THUS THE LOCATION CONFIDENCE AND THE
INITIAL MOTION CONFIDENCE ARE LOW. THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS AT
295/7 FOR THIS ADVISORY. GLOBAL MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WEAKENING THE RIDGE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION AS A MID-LATITUDE TROUGH
DIGS SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE EASTERN U.S. THESE INDICATE THE CYCLONE
MAKING A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST THROUGH 72 HOURS... WITH A
TRACK OVER OR JUST EAST OF THE EASTERN BAHAMAS. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY
NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE. THE GFDL...WHICH SIX HOURS AGO WAS CALLING
FOR A MUCH MORE WESTWARD TRACK...IS NOW IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE
GUIDANCE. THIS MAY BE THE RESULT OF THE NOAA JET MISSION YESTERDAY.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO...BUT A LITTLE LEFT
OF...THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE UPPER LEVEL IN ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO LOOK FAVORABLE FOR
INTENSIFICATION...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR SUCH IN
AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS MODEL. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE
SYSTEM MAY STRENGTHEN FASTER THAN FORECAST...ESPECIALLY AFTER
REACHING HURRICANE INTENSITY.
 
GIVEN THE LOCATION AND INTENSITY UNCERTAINTIES...AND THAT THE
SOUTHWEST SIDE OF THE SYSTEM IS STILL WEAK...NO WARNINGS OR WATCHES
WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE BAHAMAS OR THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS AT
THIS TIME. HOWEVER...THESE MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY.

AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE HAS BEEN IN THE AREA OF THE
DEPRESSION AND SO FAR IT HAS FOUND A BROAD ILL DEFINED CIRCULATION
WITH STRONG GUSTY WINDS WELL TO THE EAST THE POSSIBLE CENTER. U.S.
NAVY BUOYS ALSO INDICATE A BROAD CIRCULATION AND SURFACE PRESSURES
OF THE ORDER OF 1008 MB...A DROP OF ABOUT 8 MB IN 24 HOURS. NORMALLY
THIS IS AN INDICATION OF A DEVELOPING SYSTEM.  BECAUSE THE CENTER IS
POORLY ORGANIZED...THE INITIAL MOTION IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND THERE
PROBABLY WILL BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS OF THE LOCATION AND THE MOTION
WHILE THE SYSTEM IS ORGANIZING. GLOBAL MODELS REMOVE THE CURRENT
SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM AND FORECAST A VERY FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR
THE DEPRESSION TO STRENGTHEN. THE DEPRESSION IS FORECAST TO BE A
HURRICANE BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. 

BEST ESTIMATE OF MOTION OF THE BROAD CIRCULATION IS 290/08.  MOST OF
THE MODELS BRING A MID-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES
AND THIS WOULD CREATE A PATTERN FOR THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO TURN
GRADUALLY NORTHWARD.  HOWEVER...THIS TURN IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR 
CLOSE TO THE COAST...THEREFORE RESIDENTS ALONG THE SOUTHEASTERN

SATELLITE PICTURES THIS EVENING SHOW THAT CIRCULATION OF DENNIS
REMAINS BROAD AND ILL-DEFINED. THE U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE
HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS CURRENTLY GATHERING DATA IN THE CYCLONE.  THE
LATEST VORTEX MESSAGE FROM THIS MISSION INDICATES THAT THE CENTER
IS A TAD SOUTH AND WEST OF THE LAST ADVISORY POSITION. THIS PLACES
THE CENTER WEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION. HOWEVER...RECENT SATELLITE
IMAGERY SUGGESTS THE CENTER MAY BE RE-FORMING TO THE EAST OF THE
RECON POSITION. WITH THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY AND BROAD NATURE
OF THE SURFACE CIRCULATION THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 285/10 KTS
...WHICH IS BASED ON A 24-HR MEAN.  

ALL OF THE NUMERICAL MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE EVOLUTION
OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS. THIS WOULD RESULT IN A NORTHWEST MOTION FOLLOWED BY
A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH BY LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. MOST OF
THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS REFLECT THIS SCENARIO...AS DOES THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THE NHC TRACK IS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE
GUIDANCE AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST GFDL OUTPUT. THIS
IS ALSO SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY MAINLY DUE TO THE
INITIAL MOTION/POSITION ESTIMATE. 

THE UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW OVER DENNIS APPEARS WELL-ESTABLISHED.
ANALYSES FROM CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SHOW LIGHT 
SHEAR CONDITIONS AND THE GLOBAL MODELS FORECAST AN UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGE OVER THE CYCLONE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE INTENSITY
FORECAST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND CALLS FOR
GRADUAL STRENGTHENING.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAKES THE NORTHWARD TURN CLOSE TO THE U.S.
SOUTHEAST COAST POSING A POTENTIAL THREAT TO GEORGIA AND THE
CAROLINAS. THEREFORE...RESIDENTS ALONG THE ENTIRE SOUTHEASTERN
UNITED STATES COAST SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
SYSTEM.

THE POORLY-DEFINED CENTER OF DENNIS REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON
INFRARED IMAGERY...BUT APPEARS TO STILL BE EXPOSED WEST OF THE MAIN
CONVECTION. SATELLITE CENTER LOCATIONS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE OVER 60
MILES APART...WHICH ADDS TO THE LOW LOCATION CONFIDENCE. THE INITIAL
MOTION FOR THIS PACKAGE IS SET TO 285/7 AND THE MAXIMUM WINDS REMAIN
40 KT.

THE 00Z AVIATION MODEL WAS WEAKER WITH THE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH...
WITH THE RESULT THAT AVN-BASED GUIDANCE TAKES THE STORM FURTHER WEST
THAN 6 HOURS AGO. THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST REFLECTS THIS AND
ADJUSTS THE TRACK TO THE LEFT AND SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE. IT IS NOTEWORTHY THE AVN IS THE WEAKEST MODEL WITH THE
TROUGH...AS THE NOGAPS...UKMET...AND ECMWF MODELS USE A STRONGER
TROUGH TO TURN DENNIS MORE QUICKLY NORTHWARD.

DESPITE THE ANTICYCLONE OVER DENNIS...THE CONVECTION IS DISPLACED
EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER AS IF THE SYSTEM IS SHEARED. IT MAY
BE THAT AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS IS
PRODUCING A NORTHWESTERLY FLOW THAT IS UNDERCUTTING DENNIS'
ANTICYCLONE. THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS REDUCED BY 5 KT FROM THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE TO REFLECT THE SLOWER THAN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT TO
THIS TIME.
 
THE NEW FORECAST TRACK REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE WATCHES AND WARNINGS

RECON INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE PRESSURE DECREASED ONLY TO 1004
MB...NOT MUCH SINCE YESTERDAY. HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE
IMAGES INDICATE THAT CENTER OF DENNIS IS BETTER DEFINED TODAY BUT
STILL PARTIALLY EXPOSED AND LOCATED TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE
CONVECTION. DESPITE MODELS FORECASTING A 200 MB ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
SYSTEM...IT HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET AND SHEAR CONTINUES. 
HOWEVER...THE OVERALL OUTFLOW IS NOW BEGINNING TO BECOME BETTER
ESTABLISHED...AS FORECAST BY GLOBAL MODELS AND CONVECTION CONTINUES
TO INCREASE.  BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL MODELS STRENGTHEN THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE.  THEREFORE...DENNIS IS FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE BY 36
HOURS OR SO.
 
DENNIS IS NEARLY STATIONARY AS INDICATED BY RECON DATA...PERHAPS
BECAUSE IT IS STILL IN A FORMATIVE STAGE BUT IS FORECAST TO RESUME A
SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK LATER TODAY. THE MAIN PLAYER IS THE LARGE
MID-TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST BY GLOBAL MODELS TO BE
ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.  THE TIMING OF THE INTERACTION OF
THE TROUGH WITH DENNIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT MAY DETERMINE IF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE EVENTUALLY MOVES NORTHWARD OR NOT.  IF DENNIS
CONTINUES TO MOVE LITTLE AND MISSES THE TROUGH...THIS WOULD GIVE
TIME FOR THE LARGE SCALE PATTERN TO CHANGE IN THE LONGER TERM.  THE

TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST AHEAD OF THE TROUGH...WHICH IS
THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO AT THIS TIME.   THIS TRACK IS IN BETWEEN

...CORRECTION TO PARAGRAPH TWO...DANNY TO DENNIS... 

THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH DENNIS IS GRADUALLY IMPROVING 
IN ORGANIZATION.  THE CENTER IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION
AND THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS WELL DEFINED IN ALL QUADRANTS.
HOWEVER...THERE ARE STILL LOW-CLOUDS MOVING AWAY FROM THE
CIRCULATION IN THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE STORM.  EARLIER
INFORMATION FROM THE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE REVEALED THAT THE CENTER
HAD GRADUALLY SHIFTED EASTWARD UNDER THE CONVECTION...INDICATING
STRENGTHENING...AND INDEED...PRESSURE DROPPED TO 1000 MB AND WINDS
INCREASED TO 55 KNOTS.  GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO FORECAST A 200 MB
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM AND THIS APPEARS TO BE MATERIALIZING.
THIS PATTERN WOULD CREATE VERY FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR
INTENSIFICATION. IN FACT...BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL BRING DENNIS TO 
ABOUT 90 TO 95 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS.  SINCE THESE MODELS ARE THE BEST
GUIDANCE AVAILABLE...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A 
95-KNOT HURRICANE BY 72 HOURS.

DENNIS HAS BEEN MOVING LITTLE WHILE REORGANIZING.  HOWEVER...A SLOW
WEST-NORTHWEST GRADUAL TRACK SHOULD BEGIN TONIGHT. LATEST RUN FROM
GLOBAL AND TRACK MODELS CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT THE TROUGH ALONG
THE EAST COAST WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO STEER DENNIS NORTHWEST AND
NORTHWARD.  CONSEQUENTLY...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH INDICATE THE PRIMARY THREAT IS NORTHWARD
TOWARD THE CAROLINAS.

THE LATEST AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER CENTER FIX SUGGESTS
THAT DENNIS HAS BEGUN TO DRIFT WEST-NORTHWESTWARD...AS ANTICIPATED
IN THE LAST ADVISORY PACKAGE. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW
300/3 KTS. THE SYNOPTIC REASONING BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST IS
UNCHANGED AS THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
SHOULD GRADUALLY STEER DENNIS ON A GENERAL NORTHWEST HEADING BEFORE
PULLING THE CYCLONE NORTHWARD AFTER 48 HRS. THE 00Z TRACK MODEL
SUITE GENERALLY SUPPORTS THIS SCENARIO.  BAMD CONTINUES TO BE THE
LEFT-MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE WHILE NOGAPS MOVES DENNIS ON A
GENERAL SLOW NORTHWARD TRACK THROUGH 72 HRS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WITH LBAR AND THE 18Z GFDL RUN.  THIS TRACK IS SLIGHTLY RIGHT OF 
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY MAINLY DUE TO THE INITIAL MOTION/POSITION
ESTIMATE.  ANOTHER SYNOPTIC FLOW MISSION IS BEING FLOWN THIS EVENING
BY THE NOAA G-IV AND P-3 AIRCRAFT TO COLLECT UPPER LEVEL DATA AROUND
DENNIS. THIS DATA WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE 00Z NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL SUITE.
 
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT RECENTLY REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE
OF 998 MB...A 10 MB DROP OVER THE LAST 24 HRS...AND WINDS OF 67 KTS
AT 1500 FEET. THIS SUPPORTS MAINTAINING THE INITIAL INTENSITY AT
55 KTS. THE LATEST RECON FIX AS WELL AS SATELLITE ANIMATION SHOWS
THAT THE CIRCULATION CENTER IS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE SYSTEM IS EXPERIENCING SOME
NORTHWESTERLY WIND SHEAR...AND ANALYSES FROM CIMSS/UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN SUPPORTING THIS. THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL ALSO
ACKNOWLEDGES THE SHEAR. HOWEVER...WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED OUTFLOW
AND FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL CONDITIONS FORECAST TO EVOLVE...GRADUAL
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST IN LINE WITH THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS.
 
THE 21Z REPORT FROM BUOY 41651 SHOWED 42 KT WINDS.  THIS DATA ALONG
WITH THE LATEST HRD WIND ANALYSIS WERE USED TO ADJUST THE WIND RADII
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK STILL BRINGS DENNIS FAR ENOUGH WEST
TO POSE A THREAT TO THE SOUTHEAST U.S...ESPECIALLY THE CAROLINAS...

HURRICANE DENNIS DISCUSSION NUMBER  10
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT THU AUG 26 1999
 
AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT FOUND 80 KT WINDS
NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER OF DENNIS...ONCE AT FLIGHT LEVEL AND ONCE ON
A DROPSONDE. THE LAST REPORTED MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS 995 MB.
DENNIS IS THUS UPGRADED TO A 65 KT HURRICANE. THE HURRICANE STILL
APPEARS RAGGED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...WITH THE LOW LEVEL CENTER NEAR
THE WEST EDGE OF THE CONVECTION.

BASED ON THE LAST TWELVE HOURS OF RECONNAISSANCE FIXES...THE INITIAL
MOTION IS 300/4. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE SYNOPTIC SITUATION OR
THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. ALL GUIDANCE...
SAVE FOR THE BAMD AND BAMM WHICH CALL FOR A CONTINUING WEST-
NORTHWEST MOTION...HAVE DENNIS RESPONDING TO THE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH
WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH AND SOME ACCELERATION DURING THE
FORECAST PERIOD. THE GFDL IS THE FASTEST MOVING THE CYCLONE
NORTHWARD...BRINGING IT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST BY 72 HOURS.
GIVEN HOW DENNIS HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO MOVE AS FAST AS THE GUIDANCE
HAS SUGGESTED FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS MORE
CONSERVATIVE AND IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

WHILE THE AVIATION...NOGAPS...AND SHIPS MODELS INDICATE LIGHT SHEAR
OVER THE SYSTEM...THE SHEARED APPEARANCE AND CIRRUS CLOUDS BLOWING
EASTWARD AND NORTHEASTWARD TOWARD THE CENTER SUGGEST THE ENVIRONMENT
IS NOT QUITE AS FAVORABLE AS THE MODELS THINK. SINCE DENNIS HAS
INTENSIFIED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS
FOR CONTINUED SLOW INTENSIFICATION.

RECONNAISSANCE DATA SHOW A VERY ASYMMETRIC WIND FIELD AND THEY ARE
THE BASIS FOR THE ADJUSTED INITIAL WIND RADII. THE FORECAST WIND
RADII ARE A BLEND OF THE INITIAL CONDITIONS AND THE ANTICIPATION OF
THE WIND FIELD BECOMING MORE SYMMETRIC AS DENNIS INTENSIFIES.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK CONTINUES TO BRING DENNIS FAR ENOUGH
WEST TO POSE A THREAT TO THE SOUTHEAST U.S...ESPECIALLY THE
CAROLINAS...LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE
SOUTHEAST COAST SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
THIS SYSTEM.

HIGH RESOLUTION VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT
DENNIS IS NOT A WELL ORGANIZED HURRICANE WITH A LOW-LEVEL CENTER
THAT IS NOT WELL EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION. IN
ADDITION...AS HAS BEEN OBSERVED FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...THE
LOW CLOUDS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE...IMPLYING A LACK OF LOW-LEVEL INFLOW. SATELLITE
CLOUD WIND VECTOR ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWS THAT THERE IS NORTHWEST
FLOW...AT SOME HIGH LEVEL...DISRUPTING THE CLOUD PATTERN.  ALL OF
THE ABOVE SUGGEST THAT DENNIS IS NOT STRENGTHENING SIGNIFICANTLY.
BOTH GFDL AND SHIPS MODELS INSIST ON FORECASTING STRENGTHENING AS AN
UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE DEVELOPS OVER DENNIS.  CONSEQUENTLY...THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST MAKES DENNIS A 95 KNOT-HURRICANE BY 72
HOURS.
 
THE HURRICANE IS MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST ABOUT 6 KNOTS.  LATEST GLOBAL
AND TRACK MODEL RUNS..CONSISTENTLY...CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT THE
TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED STATES WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO
STEERED DENNIS NORTHWEST AND NORTHWARD DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS.  THIS
HAS BEEN THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO PROVIDED SINCE YESTERDAY AND
CONTINUES TO BE TODAY. ALTHOUGH...THE 72-HOUR OFFICIAL FORECAST
POSITION IS VERY CLOSE TO THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST.  ALL INTERESTS
ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT THU AUG 26 1999

DENNIS CONTINUES TO BE WITHIN A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT AND REALLY...IT
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A TYPICAL HURRICANE ON SATELLITE IMAGES.  THE
ONLY SIGN OF POSSIBLE STRENGTHENING WAS A REPORT FROM THE LATEST
RECON SUGGESTING THE FORMATION OF A PARTIAL EYEWALL.  WE HAVE BEEN
FORECASTING THE POSSIBLE INTENSIFICATION OF DENNIS...ASSUMING A
RELAXATION OF THE SHEAR... AS PREDICTED BY THE MODELS...BUT THE FACT
IS...THAT THE SHEAR CONTINUES OVER THE TROPICAL CYCLONE.  HOWEVER...
I CAN NOT IGNORE SHIPS MODEL WHICH BRINGS DENNIS TO A 95 KNOTS AND
THE GFDL THAT DROPS THE PRESSURE TO 930 MB BY 72 HOURS. 
CONSEQUENTLY...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST MAKES DENNIS A 95
KNOT-HURRICANE BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  
 
THE HURRICANE HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY DURING MOST OF THE DAY. 
THE MID TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED STATES
APPEARS TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO STEER DENNIS NORTHWEST AND NORTHWARD
DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS.  AS A RESULT OF THE TROUGH...DYNAMICAL
MODELS ARE CONSISTENTLY INDICATING A NORTHWEST AND NORTHWARD TURN
BEYOND 36 HOURS.  LATEST AVN RUN IS NOW IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE
UK...GDFL AND LBAR MODELS.  THESE MODELS BRING DENNIS VERY CLOSE TO
THE NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA COASTS BY 72 HOURS. 

ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

THE CLOUD PATTERN OF DENNIS STILL REFLECTS A SHEARING ENVIRONMENT.
THE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER CENTRAL CUBA IS RESTRICTING THE
OUTFLOW SOMEWHAT OVER THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  MEANWHILE...THE
OUTFLOW OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE HAS IMPROVED MARKEDLY OVER THE
LAST 12-24 HRS WITH WATER VAPOR IMAGERY HINTING AT THE DEVELOPMENT
OF AN UPPER LOW NEAR 23N60W. THERE HAVE BEEN NO INDICATIONS OF
FURTHER STRENGTHENING THIS EVENING WITH THE LATEST REPORTS RELAYED
FROM THE AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT SHOWING THAT THE CENTRAL
PRESSURE HAS RISEN SLIGHTLY...TO 992 MB. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO NOAA
P-3 RADAR IMAGERY...AND TRMM SATELLITE IMAGERY...EARLIER THIS
AFTERNOON WHICH SUGGESTED THE FORMATION OF A PARTIAL EYEWALL
FEATURE. ALTHOUGH THESE ARE CONFLICTING SIGNS...THE CENTER IS MORE 
INVOLVED WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION THAN 24 HRS AGO. THEREFORE...WE 
WILL CALL FOR GRADUAL STRENGTHENING...CONTINGENT ON THE VERTICAL
SHEAR DIMINISHING...CONSISTENT WITH THE LAST ADVISORY AND IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS AND THE GFDL. THE TROPICAL STORM-FORCE WIND
RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED USING THE LATEST HRD ANALYSIS.  
 
THE LATEST RECON FIXES INDICATE THAT DENNIS IS DRIFTING TO THE WEST-
NORTHWEST. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE...USING A 12-24 HR MEAN...IS
300/05 KTS. ALTHOUGH STEERING CURRENTS ARE RELATIVELY WEAK AT THIS
TIME...DENNIS SHOULD BEGIN TO RESPOND TO THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THE COLD
LOW PROGED TO CUT OFF OVER THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE SHOULD PULL THE
CYCLONE MORE TO THE NORTH NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY 
AND IS MIDWAY BETWEEN NOGAPS AND THE UKMET. THE GFDL IS SOMEWHAT
TO THE LEFT OF THIS TRACK.  

AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNEMT OF THE BAHAMAS...A TROPICAL
STORM WARNING WILL BE ISSUED FOR NEW PROVIDENCE...GRADN BAHAMA AND
THE BERRY ISLANDS.

ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST...PRIMARILY GEORIA AND THE
CAROLINAS...SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
HURRICANE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/06 BASED ON RECON FIXES.  THE 00Z
AVIATION MODEL SHOWS A 500 MB CUT OFF LOW DROPPING INTO THE
NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO IN 72 HOURS AND THIS FORCES THE BAM MODELS
TO MOVE THE HURRICANE RATHER CLOSE TO THE CENTRAL FLORIDA EAST COAST
BEFORE TURNING NORTHWARD.  ALL OF THE OTHER MODELS KEEP THE
HURRICANE FURTHER EAST WHICH KEEPS THE HIGHEST THREAT TO THE
CAROLINAS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY BUT SHIFTED SLIGHTLY WEST OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AT 24
THROUGH 48 HOURS IN RESPONSE TO THE SIGNAL OF THE AVIATION MODEL. 
THE FORECAST TRACK IS CLOSE TO THE LATEST GFDL MODEL AND TO THE LEFT
OF THE UKMET...NOGAPS...LBAR AND HPC FORECAST.  THE FORECAST TRACK
TAKES THE HURRICANE TO THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS IN 24 HOURS AND
HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE IN EFFECT FOR THIS AREA.
 
THE LAST RECON MISSION REPORTED MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS IN THE 65
KNOT RANGE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT DENNIS MAY HAVE WEAKENED SLIGHTLY.
BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN EXCELLENT BURSTING CDO PATTERN FOR THE PAST
FEW HOURS AND THE RECON CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 988 MB...DOWN 5
MB IN 6 HOURS.  ALSO THE RECON MISSION REPORTED AN EYEWALL FORMING.
THIS IS ALL IN THE FACE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE WESTERLY SHEAR WHICH
HAD BEEN IMPINGING ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CIRCULATION.  SO RATHER
THAN DECREASE THE WIND SPEED TO 65 KNOTS...THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS
KEPT AT 70 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST...AS BEFORE...IS FOR SLOW
STRENGHTENING FOLLOWING THE SHIPS MODEL...THE ANTICIPATION OF LIGHT
VERTICAL SHEAR AND CONTINUED WARM SSTS.
 
THE FORECAST TRACK SHOWS THE HIGHEST THREAT TO THE CAROLINAS...BUT
THE FORECAST TRACK IS UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE TO FLORIDA AND ALL
INTERESTS ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST...FROM FLORIDA THROUGH NORTH
CAROLINA SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS
HURRICANE.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
DENNIS IS FINALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED WHILE THE SHEAR APPEARS
TO BE RELAXING BUT A MID-TO UPPER LEVEL HIGH...CENTERED OVER WESTERN
CUBA...IS STILL INTERFERING WITH THE OUTFLOW OF DENNIS.  THE CENTER
IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION AND THE OUTFLOW IS NOW IN ALL
QUADRANTS. CONSEQUENTLY T-NUMBERS ARE UP TO 5.O AND 4.5 ON THE
DVORAK SCALE.  HOWEVER...LATEST FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT MINIMUM PRESSURE REMAINS 988 MB
WITH A 20 NMI EYE BUT WINDS NO HIGHER THAT 70 KNOTS.  INITIAL
INTENSITY CONTINUES AT 70 KNOTS AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO OPTION BUT
TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING BECAUSE BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL MODELS DO SO. 
ACTUALLY... THESE MODELS ARE THE ONLY TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THE
FORECASTER. 
  
DENNIS STILL MOVING 300/06.  THE TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN UNITED
STATES IS FORECAST TO LIFT OUT WHILE A LOW IS EXPECTED TO FORM OVER
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.  THIS PATTERN SUGGESTS THAT DENNIS SHOULD
MOVE SLOWLY WHILE GRADUALLY TURNING TO THE NORTHWEST AND NORTH-
NORTHWEST DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS PARALLELING THE EAST FLORIDA COAST.

THIS MEANS THAT THE HURRICANE WILL BE THREATENING THE UNITED STATED
SOUTHEAST COAST FOR A FEW DAYS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST OF THE
GUIDANCE PRIMARILY THE GFDL.  LATEST RUN FROM THE AVN SHOWS A TRACK
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE NORTH FLORIDA COAST BUT I WILL NOT BE
SURPRISE IF THE FORECAST SWINGS BACK TO THE RIGHT LATER ON...AS THE
MODEL HAS BEEN DOING LATELY.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
DENNIS IS MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED THAN YESTERDAY...IN FACT IT IS
BETTER THAT IT IS EVER BEEN SO FAR.   IT HAS AN EYE TYPE FEATURE AND
WELL DEFINED UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW...BUT A LITTLE BIT RESTRICTED TO
THE WEST.  HOWEVER...GROUND TRUTH OBSERVATIONS FROM THE LATEST A
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE A FEW HOURS AGO INDICATE THAT THE WINDS HAVE
NOT INCREASED AND THE PRESSURE IS NOT DROPPING YET.  THIS SHOWS ONCE
AGAIN...THE UNCERTAINTIES NOT ONLY IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST BUT
ALSO IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE INITIAL INTENSITY.  NEVERTHELESS...WITH
BOTH GFDL AND SHIPS MODELS SUGGESTING STRENGTHENING AND SUCH A GOOD
PATTERN ON SATELLITE PICTURES...INTENSIFICATION IS FORECAST.
 
THE STEERING PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED AND MODELS... IN GENERAL...ARE 
CONSISTENTLY TURNING DENNIS NORTHWEST AND NORTHWARD ON A TRACK
PARALLEL AND NOT FAR FROM THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA.  HOWEVER...ONLY
A SMALL DEVIATION TO THE LEFT OF THE TRACK COULD RESULT IN AN
INCREASE OF THE WINDS NEAR THE COAST.  THEREFORE...WATCHES AND
WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.  AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...THE 72-HOUR FORECAST BRINGS DENNIS VERY CLOSE TO THE
SOUTH CAROLINA COAST.  AT THAT TIME...THE TROUGH MAY BE GONE AND
BECOME REPLACED BY A HIGH. THIS COULD RESULT IN A VERY SLOW MOVING
HURRICANE WHICH COULD WAIT FOR THE NEXT TROUGH TO  MOVE THE
HURRICANE OUT TO SEA OR REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY NEAR THE COASTS OF
NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA.

DENNIS HAS CONTINUED TO GRADUALLY BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED THIS
EVENING. RADAR IMAGES RELAYED FROM THE NOAA P-3 RECONNAISSANCE
AIRCRAFT NOW SHOW A FULLY FORMED EYE...35-40 MILES IN DIAMETER.
THE AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER REPORTS THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE
IS NOW 980 MB...A 12 MB DROP OVER THE LAST 24 HRS....ALTHOUGH THE
WINDS HAVE NOT YET RESPONDED. SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE
CENTER IS NOW EMBEDDED WITHIN VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS...-75C...WITH
THE DEEP CONVECTION WRAPPING AROUND THE CENTER. ALL THESE SIGNALS
SUGGEST THAT THE INTENSIFICATION PROCESS IS BEGINNING. WE WILL
HOLD THE INITIAL INTENSITY AT 70 KTS FOR THIS ADVISORY UNTIL HIGHER
WINDS ARE CONFIRMED BY RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT. THE INTENSITY
FORECAST IS UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WHICH BRINGS
DENNIS TO A CATEGORY THREE HURRICANE BY 48 HRS.
 
AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE FIXES THIS EVENING INDICATE THAT THE CENTER
HAS BEEN DRIFTING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD DURING THE LAST 3-6 HRS. THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE...300/06 KT...IS BASED ON A 12-24 HR MEAN.
DENNIS REMAINS IN A LIGHT STEERING ENVIRONMENT.  THE DATA FROM THE
NOAA G-IV SYNOPTIC FLOW MISSION AROUND THE HURRICANE SHOWS A 500MB
RIDGE ALONG 31N/32N FROM BERMUDA TO NEAR 78W. THIS FEATURE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO STEER DENNIS ON A SLOW WEST-NORTH TO NORTHWEST COURSE
FOR THE NEXT DAY OR SO. THEREAFTER...THINGS BECOME A BIT MORE
UNCERTAIN AS THE IMPACT OF A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL LOW...SEEN IN
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI...CUTS OFF OVER THE
GULF COASTAL REGION.  THE EXACT LOCATION OF THIS LOW WILL HELP
DETERMINE...IN PART...THE STEERING OF DENNIS NEAR THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD. THE 00Z TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO
THEIR 18Z COUNTERPARTS WITH BAMS AND BAMM THE WESTERN-MOST OF THE
TRACKS. MOST OF THE DYNAMICAL-BASED GUIDANCE TURNS DENNIS AWAY FROM
THE SOUTHEAST COAST BEYOND 48 HRS HOWEVER...WE WILL WAIT FOR THE 00Z
MODEL CYCLE...WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE G-IV DATA...BEFORE MAKING ANY
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK.  THE NHC TRACK
REPRESENTS AN UPDATE TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO THE WATCHES/WARNINGS HOWEVER...ALL

CORRECTION TO INITIAL WIND SPEED...70 KNOTS NOT 75 KNOTS

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/05 BASED ON THE PAST 24 HOURS OF
MOTION.  THE 06Z MODEL GUIDANCE SHOULD BENEFIT FROM THE SYNOPTIC
SURVEILLANCE MISSION FROM WHICH DATA WAS USED TO INITIALIZE THE 00Z
AVIATION MODEL.  EVEN SO...THE 06Z MODELS HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH FROM
EARLIER GUIDANCE.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST ALSO DOES NOT CHANGE
MUCH EXCEPT AT 72 HOURS WHERE THE FORECAST POINT IS MOVED ABOUT 90
NMI FURTHER EAST.  THIS POINT IS NEAR THE GFDL FORECAST AND WEST OF
ALL THE OTHER MODELS EXCEPT THE BAM MODELS.
 
THE LATEST RECON PRESSURE IS 975 MB WHICH IS DOWN 13 MB IN 24 HOURS.
THE HIGHEST FLIGHT LEVEL WIND FROM THE RECON MISSION WAS 78 KNOTS AT
700 MB ABOUT 30 NMI NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  SO 70 KNOTS IS STILL A
GOOD SURFACE WIND SPEED FOR THIS ADVISORY.  WITH A CLOSED EYE AND
FALLING PRESSURE...IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE WINDS WILL INCREASE SOON
AS REFLECTED IN THE FORECAST TO 90 KNOTS IN 36 HOURS.  AFTER THAT
ONLY SLIGHT ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST...FOLLOWING THE

...CORRECTED ADVISORY NUMBER TO 20 
LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE SOMEWHAT ENCOURAGING.  UNANIMOUSLY...ALL
MODELS ARE GRADUALLY TURNING THE HURRICANE TO THE NORTH AND
NORTHEAST ON A TRACK PARALLEL AND CLOSE TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA AND
NORTH CAROLINA COASTS.  THE UK MODEL IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE BRINGING
THE HURRICANE OUT TO SEA...EMBEDDED IN THE FLOW AHEAD OF THE TROUGH.
THE GFDL IS THE MOST CONSERVATIVE...FORECASTING DENNIS OVER THE
SOUTH CAROLINA/NORTH CAROLINA BORDER BY 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST  HAS BEEN SHIFTED A LITTLE BIT TO THE RIGHT AND SLOWS DOWN
THE HURRICANE CONSIDERABLY BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS
IS BASED ON LONG RANGE MODELS...NOGAPS...MRF AND EMCWF WHICH
MAINTAIN THE HURRICANE MEANDERING OVER NORTH CAROLINA/VIRGINIA AND
ADJACENT WATERS...BEYOND 72 HOURS.
 
WITH THIS TRACK IN MIND...NO CHANGES IN WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE
NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.   HOWEVER...ANY DEVIATION TO THE LEFT OR AN
ACCELERATION WILL REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF WATCHES OR WARNINGS FOR A
PORTION OF SOUTHEAST COAST TONIGHT.
 
THE MINIMUM PRESSURE IS GRADUALLY DROPPING AND SATELLITE CONTINUES
TO SHOW AN IMPROVEMENT IN ORGANIZATION.  HOWEVER...THE HURRICANE
STILL LACKS A WELL DEFINED INNER CORE.  OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST
BRINGS DENNIS TO 100 KNOTS...BASED PRIMARILY ON SHIPS MODEL AND THE
FACT THAT BOTH THE GDFL AND THE GFDL COUPLED MODELS FORECAST A
PRESSURE DROP TO BETWEEN 920 AND 940 RESPECTIVELY.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A BANDING-TYPE EYE...ALTHOUGH RAGGED IN
APPEARANCE. 18/22Z RADAR IMAGERY FROM THE NOAA P-3 AIRCRAFT SHOWED 
A BROAD ILL-DEFINED EYE FEATURE WHILE QUOTING THE AIR FORCE THEY
COULD NOT SEE IT ON RADAR AND IT WAS NOT DISCERNABLE VISUALLY.  
THE LATEST RECON REPORTS THAT THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE REMAINS
969 MB...A 11 MB DROP OVER THE LAST 24 HRS. THE INITIAL INTENSITY
ESTIMATE WILL BE HELD AT 90 KTS SUPPORTED BY THE MOST RECENT HRD
WIND ANALYSIS...ALTHOUGH SURFACE DROPSONDE WINDS ARE LOWER. THE
STRENGTHENING FORECAST IS MAINTAINED FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY
WHICH BRINGS DENNIS TO A CATEGORY THREE HURRICANE IN 24 HRS.

WITH SUCH A LARGE AND RAGGED EYE FEATURE...THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE AIR FORCE RECON FIXES AND THE LATEST RADAR FIX
ESTIMATES. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 330/06 KTS. MOST OF THE
OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THEIR 18Z COUNTERPARTS
INDICATING THAT THE NEXT EAST COAST MID- TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL
PICK UP DENNIS AND ACCELERATE IT NORTHEAST JUST OFFSHORE WHILE THE
GFDL BRINGS DENNIS NORTH-NORTHWEST/NORTHWARD INTO NORTH CAROLINA BY
72 HRS...SUGGESTING THAT THE TROUGH BY-PASSES THE HURRICANE. THIS
SHOWS THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE MODELS WITH SOME MOVING THE DENNIS OUT
TO OPEN WATERS WHILE OTHER HINT KEEPING DENNIS NEAR THE COAST FOR A
PROLONGED PERIOD. WITH THE CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE
INFLUENCE OF THE APPROACHING TROUGH...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
BRINGS DENNIS NORTH-NORTHWEST THEN NORTH TO JUST OFF THE NORTH
CAROLINA COAST BY 48 HRS BEFORE TURNING THE HURRICANE NORTHEAST...
ALBEIT AT A SLOWER MOTION THAN MOST OF THE GUIDANCE. 

BASED ON THE NEW TRACK... HURRICANE WATCHES WILL BE POSTED FOR THE
SOUTH CAROLINA AND PORTIONS OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COASTS.  A PORTION
OF THE WATCH AREA WILL LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM OR
HURRICANE WARNING SUNDAY MORNING.  DENNIS IS A LARGE HURRICANE WITH
THE 34-KT RADII EXTENDING 140 NM IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT AND COULD
IMPACT A LARGE PORTION OF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. ...ALL INTERESTS
ALONG THE COASTS OF GEORGIA...SOUTH AND NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD
CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF DENNIS.    

THE 50-KT AND 34-KT WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED USING THE HRD WIND
ANALYSIS.

THE INITIL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 335/07.  ALL OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS
SHOW THE HURRICANE MOVING NORTH AND THEN NORTHEASTWARD AS A STRONG
TROUGH DROPS SOUTH FROM CANADA.  MOST OF THE MODELS SHOW AN
ACCELERATION TOWARD THE NORTHEAST BUT THE GFDL SUGGESTS THAT DENNIS
MAY NOT GET PICKED UP BY THE TROUGH AND COULD MEANDER OFF THE MID
ATLANTIC COAST.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST BUT NOT ALL THE WAY TO THE NEAREST DYNAMIC
MODELS.  THIS BIAS TO THE LEFT OF THE GUIDANCE IS A RESULT OF NOT
WANTING TO DEPART FROM THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST TOO
DRASTICALLY.

THE FORECAST TRACK IN COMBINATION WITH THE LARGE RADIUS OF 34-KNOT
WINDS REQUIRES THAT A TROPICAL STORM WARNING BE ISSUED FOR SOUTH
CAROLINA AND PART OF NORTH CAROLINA.  THERE IS PROBABLY ONLY A 50
PERCENT OR LESS CHANCE THAT TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS WILL ACTUALLY
OCCUR IN THE WARNING AREA...BUT THERE IS ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY TO
JUSTIFY THESE WARNINGS.

BASED ON RECON WIND OBSERVATIONS...THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED TO 85
KNOTS WITH AN EXPECTATION OF SOME SLOW STRENGTHENING FOR THE NEXT
DAY OR TWO.  THIS IS BASED ON THE SHIPS MODEL GUIDANCE.

11 AM EDT SUN AUG 29 1999
 
DENNIS IS NOW MOVING NORTHWARD NEAR 9 KNOTS...NEAR THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  A LARGE 500 MB TROUGH MOVING
OFF THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. COAST IN 24 HOURS IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A
SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING CURRENT THAT SHOULD CAUSE DENNIS TO
GRADUALLY TURN TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHEAST AND THEN NORTHEAST...
AWAY FROM THE COAST.  THIS IS ALSO INDICATED BY NEARLY ALL OF THE
OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE. THE CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...ALBEIT SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT.

THERE IS STILL SOME CONCERN THAT THE TROUGH WILL PULL OUT LATE IN
THE PERIOD...AND LEAVE DENNIS BEHIND.  THE CURRENT THINKING IS
THAT...IF THIS OCCURS...THE HURRICANE WILL BE WELL EAST OF THE COAST
BY THAT TIME.
 
ON SATELLITE IMAGES...DENNIS HAS BECOME A LITTLE BETTER-ORGANIZED
OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...ALTHOUGH THE EYE IS STILL SOMEWHAT RAGGED-
LOOKING.  A GPS DROPSONDE...RELEASED INTO THE EYEWALL BY THE
HURRICANE HUNTERS...MEASURED A PEAK WIND OF 109 KNOTS.  THE CURRENT
INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS ADJUSTED TO 90 KNOTS.  AN UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE
SITUATED ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO THE WEST OF DENNIS SHOULD ASSIST THE
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW AND SINCE THE OCEAN TEMPERATURES ARE QUITE
WARM...LARGE-SCALE FACTORS FAVOR STRENGTHENING.  HOWEVER...THE
LACK OF A WELL-DEFINED INNER CORE STRUCTURE IS A NEGATIVE FACTOR. 
THEREFORE ONLY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN INTENSITY IS PREDICTED AT THIS
TIME.

LATEST FIXES SUGGEST A SLIGHT EASTWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION...WHICH
HAS BEEN ANTICIPATED IN THE FORECASTS.  THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD
OF 500 MB TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. IS EXPECTED TO TURN
DENNIS TOWARD THE NORTHEAST IN 12 TO 24 HOURS.  SOME INCREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED IS LIKELY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD.  THEREAFTER...THE FORECAST IS COMPLICATED BY THE POSSIBILITY
THAT THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL LIFT NORTHEASTWARD AND LEAVE DENNIS
BEHIND.  THUS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SLOWS THE FORWARD SPEED MARKEDLY
IN 48 TO 72 HOURS...BUT THE CENTER SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY FAR FROM
THE COAST BY THAT TIME.  NONETHELESS A BLOCKING HIGH...WHICH SHOULD
REPLACE THE NORTHEAST U.S. TROUGH...MAY CAUSE DENNIS TO MEANDER OFF
THE COAST NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD AND BEYOND.

THERE WAS ONLY A SLIGHT PRESSURE DROP REPORTED BY THE HURRICANE
HUNTERS THIS AFTERNOON...SO CURRENT INTENSITY IS MAINTAINED.  THE
INNER CORE STRUCTURE IS STILL NOT WELL DEFINED.  DENNIS HAS A
LARGE... RAGGED BANDING-TYPE EYE 45 TO 50 N MI ACROSS.  SUCH
TROPICAL CYCLONES TYPICALLY DO NOT STRENGTHEN RAPIDLY.  ON THE OTHER
HAND THE WATERS ARE WARM AND THE UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW LOOKS
FAVORABLE.   MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS COULD STILL BE ATTAINED WITHIN
24 HOURS OR SO.
 
ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE FORECAST
TRACK...THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND ITS NEARNESS TO THE COAST
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS HAS PROMPTED THE ISSUANCE OF HURRICANE
WARNINGS.

REGARDLESS...THE LARGE SIZE OF THIS HURRICANE AN EXTENSIVE PORTION

POSITION ESTIMATES FROM RECONNAISSANCE AND RADAR SUGGEST THAT DENNIS

-BASED REASONING BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM
THE LAST PACKAGE AS THE MID-LEVEL TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE

JUST OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST BY 72 HRS. THEREAFTER...THERE IS
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE FUTURE TRACK OF DENNIS.
BLOCKING HIGH...WHICH SHOULD REPLACE THE NORTHEAST U.S. TROUGH...
MAY CAUSE THE CYCLONE TO MEANDER OFF THE COAST NEAR THE END OF THE

...UKMET...AND NOGAPS...ALL SHOW THE HURRICANE NOT GETTING PICKED UP
BY THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER THE NORTHEAST U.S. 
SO THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST MOVES THE HURRICANE NORTHEAST TO
EAST-NORTHEASTWARD FOR 36 HOURS WITH NO MOVEMENT FROM 36 THROUGH 72
HOURS.  THE GFDL MODEL TURNS THE HURRICANE BACK TOWARD THE WEST AND
THREATENS THE CHESAPEAKE BAY AREA WHILE THE OTHER MODELS TEND STAY A
FEW HUNDRED MILES EAST OF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST.  IT IS OF COURSE
NOT POSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHICH WAY THE HURRICANE WILL MOVE
AFTER IT GETS LEFT BEHIND BY THE TROUGH.  THE FORECAST TRACK BRINGS
THE CENTER WITHIN ABOUT 35 NMI OF THE OUTER BANKS OF N CAROLINA IN
12 HOURS SO THE HURRICANE WARNING IS EXTENDED A LITTLE NORTHWARD TO
THE NORTH CAROLINA/VIRGINIA BORDER.  

THE LATEST RECON PRESSURE IS 963 MB.  RECON DATA SHOWS THAT THE MAX
WIND SPEED IS 85 KNOTS INSTEAD OF 90.  THERE IS STILL A CHANCE OF

THE MOTION THIS MORNING HAS BEEN FASTER TO THE EAST-NORTHEAST...A
POSITIVE SIGN...BUT ALL GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT THIS A SHORT TERM
ACCELERATION.  A HOPEFULLY REPRESENTATIVE INITIAL MOTION IS 060/13. 
ALTHOUGH THE GFDL INDICATES A SHARP TURN NORTHWESTWARD BACK TOWARDS

DOUGHNUT-SHAPED RIDGE...AS THE LONG-WAVE PATTERN UNDERGOES A MAJOR
SHIFT.  IF THIS VERIFIES...DENNIS WILL MOVE LITTLE...AND THIS IS THE
OPTION FAVORED BY THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE MOST RECENT PRESSURE FROM THE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT IS 965
MB...UP FROM THE PREVIOUS FIX.  THE FIRST SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS SUGGESTS THAT DENNIS HAS PEAKED AND WILL SLOWLY
WEAKEN OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS IN A HIGH SHEAR ENVIRONMENT.  THE

AS EXPECTED...THE MOTION OF DENNIS IS STARTING TO SLOW DOWN A
BIT...FROM 18 TO 15 KNOTS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.  THE EARLIER
ACCELERATION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RELATED TO A MID-UPPER LEVEL
VORTICITY MAXIMUM DIGGING SOUTH TO THE WEST OF THE CYCLONE.  TRACK
GUIDANCE IS SPLIT AGAIN...EVEN MORE SO THAN EARLIER...WITH THE GFDL
INSISTING ON A HARD LEFT TURN AND LANDFALL IN NORTHERN NORTH
CAROLINA WITHIN 36 HOURS.  THIS IS THE REASON THAT MOST OF THE

TAKES THE SYSTEM WELL OFFSHORE BEFORE SLOWING IT DOWN.  GIVEN THE

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE MOTION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. BECAUSE OF
A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE LONGWAVE PATTERN...THE MID-LATITUDE WESTERLIES
ARE SHIFTING WELL TO THE NORTH.  AT MID-LEVELS...DENNIS IS BECOMING
SANDWICHED BETWEEN HIGH PRESSURE AREAS.  THEREFORE...THE MOTION IS
LIKELY TO BE SLOW AND ERRATIC.  THIS IS SHOWN IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.  HOWEVER IF THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH BECOMES MORE
DOMINANT...THAN A MORE WESTWARD TRACK COULD DEVELOP.  NO CHANGES
HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS SINCE DENNIS IS NO
LONGER MOVING AWAY FROM THE COAST.
 
COOL DRY AIR HAS INVADED THE CIRCULATION OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE SO
THAT THERE IS NOW LITTLE...IF ANY DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH
THE SYSTEM.  DENNIS DOES NOT LOOK VERY TROPICAL AT THIS TIME.
OBSERVATIONS INDICATE A VERY LARGE RADIUS OF MAXIMUM WINDS AND ONLY
A SLIGHT TEMPERATURE RISE AT THE CENTER.  SINCE THE SYSTEM IS NOT
FAR FROM WARM WATERS AND THE AIR MASS COULD RECOVER...THERE IS A
SLIGHT CHANCE THAT DENNIS COULD MAKE A COMEBACK.  OTHERWISE THE

PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS IDEA...BUT QUITE SLOW
MAINLY DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY.
 
SINCE THE MOTION AND FORECAST IS BACK TOWARD THE COAST...A HURRICANE
WATCH IS PUT INTO EFFECT ACROSS THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING AREA.
ANOTHER BIG QUESTION IS THE INTENSITY.  DENNIS WEAKENED BECAUSE OF
THE INTRUSION OF COOL DRY AIR INTO ITS CENTRAL CORE...AND LIKELY
ALSO BECAUSE OF STRONG HIGH-LEVEL WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS.  SINCE
THE MID-LATITUDE WESTERLIES HAVE SHIFTED NORTH OF THE EASTERN U.S.
NO NEW COLD FRONTS ARE EXPECTED TO ENTER INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OF
DENNIS DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  OCEAN TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 27 DEG
C.  TROPICAL CYCLONES RARELY COME BACK AFTER ALL DEEP CONVECTION HAS
BEEN REMOVED.  THERE WAS A TRANSIENT RE-DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION
NEAR THE CENTER...BUT THIS HAS FADED.  BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF SKILL
IN FORECASTING INTENSITY CHANGE...AND THE POSSIBILITY...ALBEIT
SLIM... THAT DENNIS COULD RE-STRENGTHEN...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
MERELY MAINTAINS 65 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

...CORRECTED HURRICANE TO TROPICAL STORM...

DENNIS CURRENTLY AS MUCH RESEMBLES AN EXTRATROPICAL LOW AS A
TROPICAL CYCLONE...WITH LITTLE SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER AND A LARGE RADIUS OF MAXIMUM WIND. THE LATEST REPORTS FROM
AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER INDICATE A 987 MB CENTRAL
PRESSURE AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 71 KT...DOWN 15 KT FROM
EARLIER TODAY. DENNIS IS THEREFORE DOWNGRADED TO A 60 KT TROPICAL
STORM.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 270/03. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORECAST
PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND THE
LARGE SCALE MODELS INDICATE A DEVELOPING RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL AND
EASTERN U.S....WHICH WOULD FAVOR DENNIS MOVING ON A WEST TO
SOUTHWEST TRACK. HOWEVER...EXISTING RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN
U.S. COULD EITHER SLOW THIS MOTION OR DEFLECT DENNIS TO THE SOUTH.
NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE IS SCATTERED BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF
BAMS...OVER KENTUCKY IN 72 HOURS...AND A98E...SHOWING A SOUTHWARD
MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS. ONE POTENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THE AVN-BASED
GUIDANCE IS THAT THE MODEL DEVELOPS A SPURIOUS LOOKING VORTEX EAST
OF DENNIS OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THIS MAY PRODUCE A MORE SOUTHWARD
MOTION IN THE GUIDANCE THAN WOULD ACTUALLY OCCUR. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS GENERALLY DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE...AND A LITTLE
TO THE WEST OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN. THE AVN AND NOGAPS
MODELS HAVE A POOR HANDLE ON AN EAST-WEST UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER
DENNIS...WHICH IS CAUSING DIFLUENCE OVER THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
CIRCULATION AND SUBSIDENCE OVER THE SOUTHERN PART. BOTH MODELS
FORECAST STRONG SHEAR OVER DENNIS...WHICH IS SUSPECT DUE TO THE POOR
INITIALIZATION. HOWEVER...WITH THE CURRENT LACK OF CONVECTION AND A
TROUGH OVER THE SYSTEM INSTEAD OF A RIDGE...A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS
FORECAST THROUGH 36 HOURS. AFTER THAT TIME...WARMER SSTS MAY HELP
HOLD THE INTENSITY UP.

ALTHOUGH THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR WEAKENING...ANY SHORT TERM
INCREASE IN THE CONVECTION COULD BRING THE SYSTEM BACK TO HURRICANE
STRENGTH. THEREFORE...THE HURRICANE WATCH WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT
UNTIL A DEFINITIVE WEAKENING TREND IS ESTABLISHED.

A FEW INTERMITTENT CONVECTIVE BURSTS...I AM TEMPTED TO DECLARE
DENNIS AS AN EXTRATROPICAL STORM.  HOWEVER...THE CYCLONE IS TOO
CLOSE TO THE COAST AND I PREFER NOT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITH
IR SATELLITE PICTURES.   LATEST RECON...A FEW HOURS AGO... MEASURED
987 MB WITH A NEARLY STATIONARY CIRCULATION CENTER.   

TRACK GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO SHOW DENNIS OR ITS REMNANTS MOVING
TOWARD THE COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ONE.  THERE ARE NO REASONS TO
CHANGE IT.   
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR WEAKENING.   HOWEVER...ANY
UNEXPECTED SHORT TERM INCREASE IN THE CONVECTION COULD BRING THE
SYSTEM BACK TO HURRICANE STRENGTH.  THEREFORE...WE ARE KEEPING THE
HURRICANE WATCH AT THIS TIME BUT LIKELY BE DISCONTINUED LATER THIS

THE CYCLONE HAS BEEN GRADUALLY FILLING AND THE CIRCULATION IS
SPINNING DOWN SLOWLY.  LATEST ESTIMATE OF MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS IS
50 KNOTS...BASED ON 80 PER CENT OF FLIGHT LEVEL WIND SPEEDS.  

AS WAS STATED EARLIER...DENNIS DOES NOT LOOK VERY TROPICAL.  COOL
DRY AIR CONTINUES TO BE ENTRAINED INTO THE CIRCULATION. OVERALL THE
SYSTEM HAS THE APPEARANCE OF AN OCCLUDED LOW.  STRONGEST WINDS ARE
NOT CLOSE TO THE CENTER.  IT IS ONLY THE SPORADIC REDEVELOPMENT OF
HEAVY SHOWERS NEAR THE CENTER THAT GIVES A HINT OF TROPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS.  BUT...SINCE DEEP CONVECTION IS MINIMAL...THE
SYSTEM BARELY MEETS DVORAK CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA.

STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW CONTINUES TO SHEAR ANY
CONVECTION THAT TRIES TO FORM NEAR THE CENTER...AND PROHIBITS
REDEVELOPMENT.  SINCE DENNIS HAS ALREADY LOST MOST OF ITS TROPICAL
CHARACTERISTICS...AND REGENERATION AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE SEEMS
UNLIKELY...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS DENNIS BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL
IN 12 HOURS.  

STEERING CURRENTS CONTINUE TO BE ALMOST NIL.  A SLOW WESTWARD TO
SOUTHWESTWARD MOTION IS FORECAST AS IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THIS
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF A MID-LEVEL RIDGE TO
THE NORTHWEST OF THE CYCLONE....AND IS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE
GLOBAL MODELS.

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHANGES SINCE EARLIER TODAY.  LAST RECON
INDICATED A BAND OF CONVECTION FEEDING INTO THE CENTER...AND WSR-
88D SHOWS THIS AS WELL.  SATELLITE IMAGERY ALSO SHOWS MORE
PERSISTENT CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  SO THE TREND TOWARD
EXTRATROPICAL STATUS HAS APPARENTLY CEASED.  THE CYCLONE MAY BE
UNDERGOING SOME SORT OF SUBTROPICAL EVOLUTION...WHEREIN THE CENTRAL
CORE IS EMBEDDED WITHIN A LARGER UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC
CIRCULATION...IN AN AREA WHERE THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS LESSENED.  IN
FACT...THE SATELLITE IMAGES SUGGEST THAT THE SHEAR OVER THE CENTER
MAY BE WEAKENING.  CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE IS 50 KNOTS AND NO
CHANGE IS PREDICTED THROUGH THE PERIOD...DUE TO OUR LACK OF
UNDERSTANDING THE FUTURE EVOLUTION OF DENNIS.    

A SLOW WESTWARD MOTION HAS BEEN OBSERVED RECENTLY...AROUND 270/3. 
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE PREVIOUS
ONE.   ALTHOUGH THE STEERING CURRENTS ARE NOT VERY WELL
DEFINED...THE PRIMARY PLAYERS APPEAR TO BE A MID-LEVEL RIDGE OVER
THE EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN U.S. AND A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONE
THAT ENVELOPS DENNIS.   THESE FEATURES ARE EXPECTED TO CAUSE A
GRADUAL BEND OF THE TRACK TOWARD THE WEST-SOUTHWEST...AND THEN
SOUTHWEST.  THIS IS ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACKS.

A CONVECTIVE BAND FLARED UP WEST OF THE CENTER OF DENNIS DURING
THE EVENING AND THEN WRAPPED AROUND THE SOUTH SIDE. THIS PULLED THE
CENTER A LITTLE EASTWARD. THE BAND HAS SINCE WEAKENED...WITH RADAR
AND SATELLITE CURRENTLY INDICATING LITTLE CONVECTION NEAR THE
CENTER. BASED ON THIS...AND PERIPHERAL OBSERVATIONS...THE MAXIMUM
SUSTAINED WINDS REMAIN AT 50 KT.

GIVE THIS EASTWARD WOBBLE...THE INITIAL MOTION FOR THIS PACKAGE IS
STATIONARY. MODEL GUIDANCE HAS SOMEWHAT CLUSTERED INTO TWO
POSSIBILITIES. THE FIRST...SUPPORTED BY THE BAMS...BAMM...AND
NHC98UK...IS FOR A GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION INTO NORTH CAROLINA IN
RESPONSE TO THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE NEAR DENNIS SHIFTING TO THE EAST.
THE SECOND...SUPPORTED BY THE AVN...NOGAPS...AND GFDL...IS FOR A
MORE SOUTHWESTWARD MOTION IN RESPONSE TO A BUILDING MID LEVEL RIDGE
OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN U.S.. EXAMINATION OF SURFACE ANALYSES
AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES BOTH OF THESE RIDGES MAY BE
DEVELOPING AS FORECAST. THUS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES AND AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. 

THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST THAT IT
IS HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. FIRST...AS MENTIONED EARLIER...
DENNIS MAY BE GOING THROUGH A SUBTROPICAL PHASE. THIS WOULD DELAY
STRENGTHENING THROUGH TROPICAL CYCLONE PROCESSES. SECOND...VERTICAL
SHEAR HAS DECREASED SINCE YESTERDAY...WITH SOME INDICATIONS OF
ANTICYCLONIC OUTFLOW. HOWEVER...WESTERLY SHEAR...WELL FORECAST BY
THE MODELS...INCREASES TO THE SOUTHWEST ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK.
THIRD...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH...POORLY INITIALIZED IN THE MODELS...
IS SEEN IN WATER VAPOR APPROACHING DENNIS FROM THE WEST. THIS MIGHT
EITHER INCREASE CONVECTION OR INCREASE SHEAR. FOURTH...DENNIS HAS
BEEN ESSENTIALLY STATIONARY FOR 36 TO 48 HOURS...AND HAS LIKELY
COOLED OFF THE OCEAN UNDERNEATH IT. THIS WOULD HAMPER
INTENSIFICATION...ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT WARMER SSTS ARE PRESENT TO THE
SOUTHWEST ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK...ESPECIALLY OVER THE GULF
STREAM. GIVEN ALL THESE UNCERTAINTIES...THE INTENSITY FORECAST HOLDS
DENNIS AT ITS CURRENT STRENGTH THROUGH 72 HOURS.

THERE IS NOTHING NEW TO SAY ABOUT DENNIS.  LETS FACE IT...DENNIS
CONTINUES TO LOOK LIKE AN EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE WITH A INTERMITTENT
PATCHES OF CONVECTION.  A SIMPLE INSPECTION OF THE FULL DISK GOES-8
SHOWS THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN OF DENNIS IS SIMILAR TO THE
EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE LOCATED ABOUT 1600 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST. 
BOTH SHIPS AND GFDL STRENGTHEN DENNIS AND IN GENERAL...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST WOULD GO ALONG WITH THESE MODELS.  IN THIS CASE
...REGENERATION IS NOT REALISTIC SINCE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE
FORECAST TO REMAIN UNFAVORABLE. 

THE WEST TO WEST-SOUTHWEST TRACK FORECAST BY MODELS AS WELL AS THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET.  DENNIS REMAINS NEARLY
STATIONARY

I HAVE THE SAME DILEMMA THAT I HAD YESTERDAY.  I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE
A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE FORECAST OR THE STATUS WITHOUT VISIBLE
IMAGES OR RECON.   THIS FORECAST IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE
PREVIOUS ONE...KEEPING DENNIS NEARLY STATIONARY FOR 12 HOURS OR SO

CLOUDS NEAR AND OVER THE CENTER.  HOWEVER THE CLOUD TOPS ARE NOT
VERY HIGH AND RADAR OBSERVATIONS DO NOT SHOW A CLEARLY-DEFINED
CENTER.  THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH SINCE YESTERDAY.
TYPICALLY FOR A CYCLONE THAT REMAINS STALLED FOR THIS LENGTH OF
TIME...THE OCEAN IS COOLED SUBSTANTIALLY BY THE SURFACE WIND
CIRCULATION.  HOWEVER IN THIS INSTANCE THE CENTER HAS REMAINED OVER
THE GULF STREAM...A VAST OCEANIC HEAT SOURCE.   SO THERE IS CONSTANT

PREDICT STRENGTHENING TO A HURRICANE LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. 
BECAUSE OF THE USUAL UNCERTAINTY IN PREDICTING INTENSITY CHANGE...
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OVERALL MOTION SINCE YESTERDAY.  OBJECTIVE
TRACK GUIDANCE INSISTS ON A MOVEMENT TOWARD THE COAST.  THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE 2-3 DAY FORECAST OF A MID-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER
THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. SHOWN BY THE AVN MODEL.  HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO

SINCE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THIS IS THE HIGHEST WIND SPEED IN
THE CIRCULATION...THE ESTIMATE OF 50 KNOTS FOR THE CURRENT INTENSITY

THIS IS A STATISTICAL MODEL BASED MAINLY ON DATA FROM TYPICAL
TROPICAL CYCLONES.  DENNIS...AT THIS STAGE...IS FAIRLY ATYPICAL WITH
SOME SUBTROPICAL-TYPE CHARACTERISTICS.  MOREOVER THE SHIPS OUTPUT
INDICATES DECREASING VERTICAL SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM...AND THIS MAY
NOT VERIFY.  GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES...NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS
FORECAST.
 
THE CENTER HAS MOVED GENERALLY SOUTHWESTWARD OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS.  WHETHER THIS IS ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF MEANDERS/WOBBLES...
OR A DEFINITIVE MOTION THAT WILL PERSIST...ONLY TIME WILL TELL. THE
STEERING ENVIRONMENT DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD IS CHARACTERIZED BY

DENNIS LOOKS BETTER ORGANIZED THIS MORNING. ALTHOUGH CONVECTIVE TOPS

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 45 KT AND 35 KT
RESPECTIVELY. THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS WILL REMAIN AT 50 KT FOR
THIS ADVISORY. AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER WILL ARRIVE IN
DENNIS AROUND 18Z TO UPDATE THE CURRENT INTENSITY AND WIND RADII.

DENNIS HAS MOVED 180/05 FOR THE PAST 12 HOURS. HOWEVER...RECENT
SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY SUGGESTS A SLOWER MOTION...SO 180/03
WILL BE USED IN THIS PACKAGE. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THE
STORM IS EMBEDDED IN A LARGE SCALE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION...WITH
MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WEST OF THE STORM OVER THE EASTERN U.S..

NORTHWEST OR NORTHERLY TRACK DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE
NORTHWEST OPTION IS SUPPORTED BY THE GFDL...NOGAPS...UKMET...
ECMWF...AND ETA MODELS...WHILE THE NORTH OPTION IS SUPPORTED BY THE
AVN...NHC98UK...AND THE BAM MODELS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK GOES
WITH THE NORTHWEST OPTION...ALTHOUGH IT IS SHIFTED SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE EARLY IN THE FORECAST AND NORTH OF IT LATER. THE
CURRENT FORECAST CALLS FOR LANDFALL IN 48 TO 60 HOURS.
 
WHILE THE OVERALL UPPER LEVEL ENVIRONMENT AROUND DENNIS IS
CYCLONIC...AN SMALL ANTICYCLONE IS FORMING OVER THE CENTER. LARGE
SCALE MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT STRONG WESTERLIES JUST SOUTHWEST
OF THE CYCLONE SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD
AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PRECEDING THE LARGE WESTERN U.S. TROUGH
APPROACHES. THIS COULD CREATE A MORE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR
INTENSIFICATION. A LIMITING FACTOR...HOWEVER...IS SSTS. SHIP AND
BUOY DATA INDICATE THAT TEMPERATURES ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK ARE
26C OUTSIDE THE GULF STREAM..COMPARED TO 28C-29C A FEW DAYS AGO.
THIS MAY SLOW INTENSIFICATION. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR
LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH UNTIL 48 HOURS...WHEN DENNIS WILL BE
PASSING OVER THE GULF STREAM.

CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH DENNIS IS LESS WELL DEFINED THAN
EARLIER...WITH RAGGED BANDS PRIMARILY IN THE NORTHEASTERN
SEMICIRCLE. HOWEVER...AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER RECENTLY
REPORTED A 985 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE WITH 59 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS
NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER. THUS...THE CURRENT INTENSITY REMAINS AT 50
KT.

OF GREATER CONCERN NOW IS THE MOTION. AFTER A WOBBLE EASTWARD THIS
MORNING...THE LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY AND RECON FIXES SUGGEST A
NORTHWEST MOTION. IF THIS IS THE START OF THE EXPECTED TURN...IT IS
HAPPENING 12 TO 24 HOURS EARLIER THAN MODEL GUIDANCE HAS FORECAST.
TO GUARD AGAINST THIS BEING YET ANOTHER WOBBLE...THE INITIAL MOTION
IS SET TO 300/2. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE SYNOPTIC SITUATION OR
THE FORECAST GUIDANCE FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AS THE MODELS
STILL AGREE ON WEAKENING OF THE EASTERN U.S. RIDGE THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD. HOWEVER...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED
NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK AS THE SYSTEM IS NO LONGER MOVING SOUTH.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT DESPITE THE SHIFT THE FORECAST TRACK IS TO
THE RIGHT OF MOST OF THE GUIDANCE...PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST 36
HOURS.

THERE IS ALSO LITTLE CHANGE IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST PHILOSOPHY
FROM THIS MORNING. DENNIS IS STILL EMBEDDED IN A UPPER LEVEL
CYCLONIC ENVIRONMENT...WITH STRONG NORTHWESTERLY FLOW JUST SOUTHWEST
OF THE CYCLONE. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE
CAROLINAS SHOULD BUILD A RIDGE OVER DENNIS...WHICH WOULD BE A MORE
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT. THE MAIN LIMITATION IS THE SSTS...WHICH ARE
26C-27C OUTSIDE OF THE GULF STREAM. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR
SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION AS DENNIS PASSES OVER THE GULF STREAM...
FOLLOWED BY WEAKENING AFTER LANDFALL.

WITH THE CHANGES IN THE FORECAST TRACK...TROPICAL STORM WATCHES ARE
BEING ISSUED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING AREA.

RECON DATA AND RADAR FROM MOREHEAD CITY INDICATE THAT DENNIS IS
MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST ABOUT 5 KNOTS.  THE HIGH PRESSURE WHICH WAS
BLOCKING DENNIS IS GRADUALLY MOVING EASTWARD ALLOWING THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE TO MOVE TOWARD WEST-NORTHWEST. WITH A NEW TROUGH APPROACHING
THE AREA...DENNIS SHOULD GRADUALLY TURN TO THE NORTH BEYOND 36

GENERAL...MOVE THE CYCLONE INLAND IN ABOUT 24 HOURS OR SO.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS DENNIS NEAR THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST WITHIN
THE WARNING AREA IN ABOUT 24 HOURS OR LESS AND THEREAFTER...OVER

RAINS.
 
LATEST PRESSURE FROM THE RECON WAS 986 MB WITH A 25 N MI DIAMETER

EAST OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS AND FOUND A WELL DEFINED AND TIGHT LOW-
LEVEL CIRCULATION OF 1004 MB AND 55-KNOTS WINDS. THEREFORE THE
SYSTEM HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM EMILY.  

EMILY IS A SMALL STORM AND IS UNDER SOME NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR WHICH
IS FORECAST TO RELAX.  SHIPS MODELS MAKES EMILY A 92-KNOT HURRICANE
BY 60 HOURS.  THEREFORE A GRADUAL INTENSIFICATION IS INDICATED IN
THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST.

EMILY IS MEANDERING AT THIS TIME. IT APPEARS THAT MUCH LARGER
CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH APPROACHING CINDY IS CUTTING THE
EASTERLY STEERING CURRENTS.  HOWEVER...MOST OF THE TRACK MODELS
FORECAST EMILY TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND BRING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE

THE WELL-DEFINED SURFACE CIRCULATION OF EMILY IS NOW EXPOSED WITH 
LIMITED DEEP CONVECTION MAINLY SOUTH OF THE CENTER. THE CENTER HAS
BEEN MOVING NORTHWARD OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS OR SO BASED ON SATELLITE
ESTIMATES. THIS MAY BE PARTIALLY DUE TO TROPICAL STORM CINDY WHICH

EMILY BACK TOWARD THE NORTHWEST WITHIN 12 HOURS OR SO HOWEVER...
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN THIS FORECAST THERE IS A
POSSIBILITY THAT EMILY MAY BECOME ABSORBED INTO THE LARGER
CIRCULATION OF CINDY DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 

THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF EMILY HAS BEEN REDUCED TO 40 KTS FOR THIS

CONVECTION. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO EXPERIENCING MODEST EASTERLY SHEAR.
SHEAR...10 TO 15 KT.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST HAS BEEN TRIMMED BACK

BURST OF CONVECTION DEVELOPING JUST SOUTHWEST OF THE CENTER. SINCE
THE DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF
WHAT THE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT FOUND YESTERDAY AFTERNOON...THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS UNCERTAIN. THE MAXIMUM WINDS WILL REMAIN 40 KT
FOR THIS ADVISORY.

MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY AROUND THE ECLIPSE PERIOD SUGGESTS THAT EMILY
HAS STARTED A NORTHWEST MOTION. THE INITIAL MOTION FOR THIS PACKAGE
WILL BE 335/5...WHICH IS THE 12 HOUR MOTION. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE
IS CLUSTERED AROUND A NORTH-NORTHWEST TRACK AND IS IN MUCH BETTER
AGREEMENT THAN SIX HOURS AGO...WITH THE ONLY OUTLIERS TO THE RIGHT
BEING THE NOGAPS AND THE UKMET. THIS AGREEMENT LOOKS A LITTLE
STRANGE GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERACTION WITH CINDY. THE

LARGER CIRCULATION OF CINDY...IT WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE SIMILAR TO
HOW KAREN DISSIPATED WHILE INTERACTING WITH IRIS IN 1995. ON THE
OTHER HAND...THE SHIPS MODEL CONTINUES TO BRING EMILY TO HURRICANE
STATUS BY 60 HOURS...WHICH COULD OCCUR IF EMILY STAYS FAR ENOUGH
AWAY FROM CINDY. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR SLOW AND STEADY
INTENSIFICATION SIMILAR TO...BUT A LITTLE SLOWER THAN...THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE. THIS IS BASED ON THE CONTINUED EASTERLY SHEAR AND CURRENT
LACK OF CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION.
 
ALTHOUGH THE FORECAST TRACK DOES NOT PRESENTLY CALL FOR LANDFALL...
ALL INTERESTS IN THE LESSER ANTILLES...PRIMARILY THE NORTHERN
PORTION...SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF EMILY.

EMILY IS HOLDING ITS OWN AGAINST SOME EASTERLY SHEAR.  AN AIR FORCE
RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATING TROPICAL STORM EMILY
THIS MORNING FOUND FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 45 KT...AND AN EXTRAPOLATED
PRESSURE OF 1005 MB...SO THE INTENSITY WILL BE MAINTAINED AT 40 KT
FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE RECONNAISSANCE DATA COMFIRM THAT EMILY
REMAINS A VERY COMPACT STORM.  THE FUTURE INTENSITY OF EMILY DEPENDS
IN GREAT MEASURE ON ITS TRACK RELATIVE TO CINDY AND DENNIS.  AS THE
SMALLEST OF THE THREE...EMILY WILL BE THE LEAST ABLE TO GOVERN ITS
OWN FATE.  SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE BRINGS EMILY TO 79 KNOTS IN 72
HOURS.  ALTHOUGH I BRING EMILY TO HURRICANE STRENGTH DURING THE
PERIOD...IF DENNIS DOES NOT MOVE NORTHWARD AS ANTICIPATED THEN ITS
OUTFLOW COULD EVENTUALLY ADVERSLY AFFECT EMILY.
 
RECONNAISSANCE DATA SUGGEST THAT EMILY IS NOW MOVING AT 305/6...MORE
TO THE LEFT THAN EARLIER.  MOST MODEL GUIDANCE IS TIGHTLY CLUSTERED
ON A CONTINUED TRACK IN THIS DIRECTION.  OUTLIERS ARE THE AVN...WITH
AN INITIAL NORTH-NORTHWESTWARD TRACK...AND THE LBAR...WHICH
INDICATES MORE OF A THREAT TO THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS.  AS THE
CIRCULATION OF CINDY MOVES AWAY FROM EMILY...I EXPECT THE FORWARD
SPEED OF EMILY TO INCREASE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE GUIDANCE AND SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

WATCHES OR WARNINGS MAY BE NECESSARY WITHIN THE NEXT 12 HOURS FOR
SOME OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

A RECENT AIR FORCE FIX SHOWS THAT EMILY HAS ACQUIRED A LITTLE MORE
NORTHWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION SINCE THIS AFTERNOON.  THIS MAY BE A
RESULT OF THE INFLUENCE OF NEARBY HURRICANE CINDY.  THE TRACK
GUIDANCE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A MOSTLY NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR
72 HOURS...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED ONLY SLIGHTLY
TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  THIS DECREASES THE THREAT TO
THE LEEWARD ISLANDS JUST A LITTLE AND ANY WATCHES FOR THESE ISLANDS
CAN BE DELAYED AT LEAST 6 MORE HOURS.  

THE RECON FLIGHT REPORTED A CENTRAL SURFACE PRESSURE OF 1007 AND A
MAXIMUM 1500 FT WIND SPEED OF 43 KNOTS...SO EMILY HAS NOT
STRENGTHENED.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING
FOR 72 HOURS FOLLOWING THE SHIPS MODEL.

THE STORM REMAINS POORLY ORGANIZED WITH SPORADIC CONVECTION AND NO
BANDING FEATURES.  EASTERLY SHEARING CONTINUES TO PREVENT
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT.  MOREOVER...THE LOW-LEVEL INFLOW IS LIKELY
BEING DISRUPTED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE HURRICANE CINDY TO THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST.  IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE SEPARATION DISTANCE BETWEEN
THESE TWO SYSTEMS WILL BE INCREASING WITH TIME...SO THE HOSTILE
INFLUENCE OF CINDY SHOULD LESSEN.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST
MODEL INDICATES DECREASING SHEAR OVER EMILY...AND SHOWS THE STORM
STRENGTHENING TO A HURRICANE IN 36 TO 48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS NOT AS AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE OTHER SOURCES OF VERTICAL
SHEARING... SUCH AS AN UPPER LOW NOW JUST NORTH OF 20N OR THE UPPER
OUTFLOW FROM HURRICANE DENNIS...COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON
EMILY.

THE SYNOPTIC POSITION AND MOTION ARE VERIFIED BY OBSERVATIONS FROM A
FRENCH BUOY...I.D. 41101 NEAR 14.6N56.2W...WHICH SHOWED A 1009.2 MB
PRESSURE AND EAST-SOUTHEAST WINDS OF 27 KNOTS.  EMILY IS ESTIMATED
TO BE MOVING 315/06.  SOME OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE SHOWS A
MORE NORTHWARD MOTION...PRESUMABLE DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF CINDY. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS
TRACK...BUT IT IS ASSUMED THAT CINDY WILL MOVE FAR ENOUGH AWAY SO
THAT THE NORTHWESTWARD TRACK WILL CONTINUE.

SINCE THE FORECAST KEEPS THE STORM EAST OF THE LESSER ANTILLES AND
EMILY IS SO SMALL IN SIZE...WATCHES AND/OR WARNINGS ARE NOT DEEMED
NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.

A MID LEVEL CIRCULATION BEING LEFT BEHIND 150 NM TO THE SOUTH OF THE

INCREASED IN BETWEEN THE TWO CIRCULATIONS...BUT THIS IS NOT
INTERPRETED AS A RESTRENGTHENING OF THE CYCLONE.  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
PROBABLY SOME GUSTS TO TROPICAL STORM FORCE REMAINING...EMILY WILL

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER MADE TWO CENTER FIXES ON EMILY
THAT WERE 50 NM APART. THE SECOND FIX HAD THE BETTER DEFINED CENTER
WITH A 1009 MB PRESSURE AND 44 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS TO THE EAST.
THIS SUGGESTS THAT EMILY IS CLOSE TO REGAINING TROPICAL STORM
INTENSITY. SINCE THE FIXES WERE SO FAR APART...AND THE ASSOCIATED
DEEP CONVECTION IS VERY POORLY ORGANIZED...THE SYSTEM REMAINS A
DEPRESSION ON THIS PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. THE SECOND AIRCRAFT FIX
WOULD SUGGEST A NORTH-NORTHEAST MOTION. THE INITIAL POSITION AND
MOTION...360/10...ARE BASED ON A BLEND OF THE TWO FIXES. THE
AVIATION-BASED GUIDANCE TURNS EMILY TO THE NORTHWEST...WHILE THE
NOGAPS AND UKMET TRACK THE CYCLONE NORTHWARD IN RESPONSE TO CINDY.
THE FORECAST TRACK STILL CALLS FOR A NORTHWESTWARD TURN...BUT IT IS
SHIFTED TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE PREVIOUS TRACK. IF VISIBLE
SATELLITE IMAGERY VERIFIES THE NORTH-NORTHEAST MOTION...BOTH THE
POSITION AND THE TRACK WILL NEED TO BE RE-LOCATED.

EXPOSED TO THE NORTH OF THE PRIMARY CONVECTIVE CLUSTER. BASED ON
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 35 KT AND 30 KT FROM SAB AND
TAFB...THE SYSTEM WILL REMAIN A MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM FOR THIS

IT NOW APPEARS THAT EMILY WILL MEET ITS DEMISE AT THE HANDS OF CINDY

LOW CLOUD ELEMENTS TO THE WEST OF EMILY ARE MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST

EMILY IS GETTING ENTRAINED INTO CINDY. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT EMILY WILL MOVE AROUND THE SOUTHEAST
SIDE OF CINDY UNTIL IT DISSIPATES.

STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH OUTFLOW FROM CINDY AND AN

EMILY IS DISSIPATING AS IT BECOMES ABSORBED INTO CINDY.  ISOLATED
CONVECTION FLARES UP PERIODICALLY ON THE SOUTH END OF THE REMNANT

THE AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER THAT MOVED NORTH-NORTHWEST ACROSS THE
SOUTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED TODAY.
SATELLITE IMAGERY ALONG WITH MEXICAN SURFACE AND RADAR DATA INDICATE
A SURFACE CIRCULATION HAS FORMED WITH SUFFICIENT ORGANIZED
CONVECTION TO BE DECLARED A TROPICAL DEPRESSION. 

THE INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN...BUT IS ESTIMATED TO BE A NORTH-
NORTHWEST DRIFT...335/2. LARGE SCALE RIDGING EAST OF THE CYCLONE
SHOULD ALLOW FOR A GENERAL NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION...ALTHOUGH RIDGING
SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER NORTHERN MEXICO AND TEXAS MAY KEEP
THE MOTION SLOW. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE...RUN USING A STATIONARY
INITIAL MOTION...INDICATED A NORTH-NORTHWEST TRACK. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS FOR A NORTH-NORTHWEST MOTION WITH LANDFALL IN
NORTHEASTERN MEXICO IN 24 TO 36 HOURS. ONE POSSIBILITY TO KEEP AN
EYE ON IS THAT THE DEPRESSION MAY TRY TO IMITATE BRET...WITH A MORE
NORTHERLY TRACK AND MORE TIME OVER WATER.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR SLOW STRENGTHENING TO TROPICAL
STORM INTENSITY JUST BEFORE LANDFALL...FOLLOWED BY DISSIPATION OVER
LAND. ON THIS BASIS...THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO HAS ISSUED A TROPICAL
STORM WARNING FROM TAMPICO TO MATAMOROS.

THE CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THIS EVENING...BUT MY BEST GUESS
IS THAT THE INITIAL MOTION IS 345/04.  THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWS
RATHER WEAK STEERING CURRENTS AROUND THE DEPRESSION FOR THE NEXT 72
HOURS.  THE 18Z GFDL MODEL SHOWS A SLOW CYCLONIC LOOP FOR 72 HOURS
WHILE THE BAM MODELS...UKMET AND LBAR SHOW A SLOW NORTH-NORTHWEST
MOTION.  THE HPC FORECAST IS ALSO SLOW NORTH-NORTHWEST.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO HPC BUT ABOUT A DEGREE FURTHER
NORTH.

THERE IS ALMOST NO DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER WHICH ALLOWS THE
FORECAST TO BE FOR VERY SLOW STRENGTHENING.  ALSO THE PROXIMITY TO
LAND COULD LIMIT THE STRENGTHENING PROCESS.  BUT THE SHIPS MODEL
DOES CALL FOR STRENGTHENING BASED ON THE WARM SSTS.

THERE IS SOME DOUBT ABOUT THE CENTER LOCATION OF THE CYCLONE ON
INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY.  BROWNSVILLE RADAR ANIMATION SUGGESTS
THAT THE CENTER IS ALREADY ON THE COAST OF MEXICO...BUT SINCE THE
CENTER IS ABOUT 200 MILES FROM THE RADAR THIS IS SPECULATIVE. 
IMAGES FROM THE TAMPICO MEXICO RADAR ARE INCONCLUSIVE.  LACKING
DEFINITIVE INFORMATION...THE CURRENT POSITION AND MOTION ESTIMATES
ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE AND HAVE CONTINUITY WITH THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORIES.  IN ANY EVENT A CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT MOVEMENT
WOULD BRING THE CENTER ACROSS THE COAST LATER TODAY.  A WEAK MID-
LEVEL RIDGE ACROSS SOUTHERN TEXAS SHOULD CAUSE A GRADUAL BEND OF THE
TRACK TOWARD THE LEFT WITH TIME.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT A LITTLE FASTER.

AFTER THE USUAL DIURNAL DECREASE...CONVECTION HAS INCREASED IN
ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEPRESSION THIS MORNING.  THE UPPER-LEVEL
OUTFLOW PATTERN OVER THE EASTERN SEMICIRCLE OF THE SYSTEM LOOKS
FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE.  THE ONLY OBVIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO STRENGTHENING IS
LANDFALL...WHICH SEEMS IMMINENT AT THIS TIME.  IF THE CENTER IS
STILL OVER WATER...THERE IS STILL A SMALL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR
THE SYSTEM TO INTENSIFY.

BROWNSVILLE WSR-88 DATA INDICATES THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION
SEVEN HAS MOVED INLAND OVER NORTHEAST MEXICO...ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE
CIRCULATION REMAINS OVER WATER. THE CENTER HAS BEEN MOVING 320/9 FOR
THE PAST 12 HOURS...AND A SLOWER NORTHWESTERLY MOTION IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE UNTIL THE CYCLONE DISSIPATES IN 24 TO 36 HOURS.
 
THE SATELLITE AND RADAR APPEARANCE SUGGESTS THE DEPRESSION WAS CLOSE
TO TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH AT LANDFALL...ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO
OBSERVATIONS OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS. THE LANDFALL ENDS THE
CHANCE OF STRENGTHENING...SO THE FOCUS NOW SHIFTS TO HEAVY RAINFALL.
THE BROWNSVILLE RADAR SHOWS A LARGE RAIN SHIELD ASSOCIATED WITH THE
CYCLONE...AND SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE BAND STILL OVER
THE GULF EAST OF THE CENTER. WIDESPREAD HEAVY RAINS ARE LIKELY OVER
NORTHEASTERN MEXICO AND PORTIONS OF EXTREME SOUTH TEXAS. THESE COULD

BROWNSVILLE WSR-88 DATA INDICATES THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION
SEVEN SLOWED AFTER LANDFALL IN NORTHEASTERN MEXICO...AND HAS AT BEST
DRIFTED WEST-NORTHWEST FOR THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. IT MAY BE THAT A
MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER NORTHWEST MEXICO AND WESTERN TEXAS HAS
SLOWED THE MOTION...ALTHOUGH LOW CLOUD MOTIONS NORTH OF THE CYCLONE
SUGGEST A SOUTHEASTERLY STEERING FLOW IS PRESENT AT THAT LEVEL. THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST CALLS FOR A SLOW WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION
UNTIL DISSIPATION.

THE SATELLITE APPEARANCE HAS CHANGED LITTLE DURING THE PAST FEW
HOURS...AND DOPPLER RADAR WINDS IN THE BAND EAST OF THE CENTER ARE
TROPICAL STORM FORCE FROM 5000-7000 FT. THUS...THE DEPRESSION IS
MAINTAINING ITSELF EVEN THOUGH THE CENTER IS INLAND. WHILE
DISSIPATION OVER LAND IS THE FORECAST...THERE ARE TWO POSSIBILITIES
THAT REQUIRE WATCHING. FIRST...THAT THE CENTER MAY REFORM OVER
WATER...WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE CYCLONE TO STRENGTHEN INTO A TROPICAL
STORM. SECOND...THAT SINCE THE PRIMARY CONVECTION REMAINS OVER WATER
THE SYSTEM COULD STRENGTHEN EVEN THOUGH THE CENTER IS OVER LAND.

THE DEEP CONVECTION OVER WATER HAS FIZZLED DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS

THE TROPICAL WAVE OVER THE CENTRAL TROPICAL ATLANTIC HAS DEVELOPED A
BROAD CYCLONIC CIRCULATION AND SUFFICIENT ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO BE
CALLED A TROPICAL DEPRESSION. THUS...ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON
TROPICAL DEPRESSION EIGHT. THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE SET TO 
25 KT BASED ON SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES OF 30 KT AND 25 KT FROM
TAFB AND SAB...RESPECTIVELY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE BROAD CENTER...
WITH THE BEST ESTIMATES 280/12. IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IF THE
CENTER JUMPED AROUND WITHIN THE BROAD CIRCULATION UNTIL THE SYSTEM
CONSOLIDATES. A LARGE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE IS NORTH OF THE CYCLONE...
WHICH WOULD SUPPORT A WEST TO WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK. NHC HURRICANE
GUIDANCE GENERALLY AGREES WITH THIS...ALTHOUGH THE BAM MODELS WANT
TO TAKE THE SYSTEM FURTHER NORTH. THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS IN BEST
AGREEMENT WITH CLIPER...LBAR... AND THE GFDL.

THE CONVECTION IS NOT VERY CONCENTRATED...AND WITH A SYSTEM AT THIS
STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY IT MAY ALL DISAPPEAR
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE CIRCULATION IS LARGE AND THE UPPER LEVEL
WINDS ARE FAVORABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT. THUS...THE INTENSITY FORECAST

SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION IS
GRADUALLY BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED WHILE MOVING TOWARD INCREASINGLY
WARMER WATERS.  THIS SYSTEM HAS A LARGE LOW-LEVEL CYCLONIC ENVELOPE
WITH PLENTY OF BANDING FEATURES AND AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW. THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER IS NOT WELL DEFINED YET.  IT IS VERY NEAR TROPICAL
STORM STRENGTH.

BOTH SHIPS AND THE GFDL MODELS BRING THE DEPRESSION TO ABOUT 80 AND
100 KNOTS RESPECTIVELY BY 72 HOURS AND GLOBAL MODELS DEVELOP AN EVEN
LARGER UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM.  STRENGTHENING
IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST.  THIS DEPRESSION
HAS ALL THE INGREDIENTS...THAT WE KNOW OF...TO BECOME A MAJOR
HURRICANE EVENTUALLY.  
 
BECAUSE THE DEPRESSION DOES NOT HAVE A WELL DEFINED CENTER YET...THE
INITIAL LOCATION AND MOTION ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME.  THE
BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14...BUT ONCE THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER BECOMES ESTABLISHED...THE POSITION WILL PROBABLY HAVE
TO BE READJUSTED...MORE LIKELY TO THE RIGHT...IF THE CENTER REFORMS
WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION. 

ALL AVAILABLE MODELS...WITH NO EXCEPTION...TURN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
GRADUALLY TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AND THEN NORTHWARD NORTH...BYPASSING
THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.  THIS IN RESPONSE TO A WEAKENING OF THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WEST OF 70W AND A STRONG APPROACHING MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH.  THIS IS REALISTIC BECAUSE THAT PATTERN HAS BEEN A
PERSISTENT FEATURE THIS SUMMER. BOTH THE OFFICIAL NHC AND HPC
FORECASTS ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE AND ARE ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE
TRACK ENSEMBLE AND VERY CLOSE TO LBAR...WHICH HAS BEEN PERFORMING
QUITE WELL IN THE DEEP TROPICS.  HOWEVER...IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT

IS AN IMPRESSIVE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
THE STORM AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO WARM ALONG
THE PROJECTED TRACK.  THEREFORE STEADY STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST. 
FLOYD HAS A LARGE CIRCULATION ENVELOPE...TYPICAL FOR CAPE VERDE-
TYPE STORMS DURING THE PEAK OF THE SEASON.  FLOYD IS A GOOD
CANDIDATE TO ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS.

SINCE IT IS A BROAD SYSTEM STILL IN THE DEVELOPING STAGE...THE
CENTER IS NOT YET WELL-DEFINED.  HOWEVER MY BEST ESTIMATE FOR THE
INITIAL MOTION IS 285/14...AS BEFORE.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A
MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE JUST EAST OF BERMUDA AT THIS

WOULD INFLUENCE THE TRACK OF THE STORM WOULD BE A LARGE MID-LATITUDE
TROUGH MOVING TOWARD THE U.S. EAST COAST BY THE END OF THE FORECAST

GREATER ANTILLES...AND CAUSE FLOYD TO TURN MORE NORTHWARD IN ROUGHLY
3 DAYS TIME.  HOWEVER...THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN 3-DAY
TRACK PREDICTIONS.  THE BAROTROPIC TRACK PREDICTION
MODEL...LBAR...WHICH SHOULD HANDLE SYSTEMS IN THE DEEP TROPICS

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA THIS
AFTERNOON ARE NOW 55 KT...45 KT...AND 55 KT RESPECTIVELY.  THERE IS
STILL NOT MUCH CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER AND THE BANDS...WHILE
IMPRESSIVE...ARE WELL-REMOVED FROM THE CYCLONE.  GIVEN THE FLOPPY
FORM OF FLOYD...THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS ONLY INCREASED TO 45 KT
FOR THIS ADVISORY.  A RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO BE IN
THE STORM OVERNIGHT.  THE OUTFLOW PATTERN IS VERY GOOD AND
SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED ONCE THE INNER CORE BECOMES
BETTER ORGANIZED.

THE CENTER IS STILL NOT EASY TO LOCATE...BUT THE INITIAL MOTION IS
ESTIMATED AS 290/14.  A MIDDLE LEVEL CUTOFF LOW NEAR BERMUDA...ALONG
WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWARD INTO THE CENTRAL
CARIBBEAN...ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT TO KEEP FLOYD NORTH
OF THE LESSER ANTILLES.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE...ROUGHLY BETWEEN THE LBAR AND GFDL.  THE
BAM MODELS INDICATE A FAIRLY SHARP TURN TO THE NORTH AT THE END OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  BEYOND 72 HOURS...THE KEY PLAYER WILL BE A
MAJOR TROUGH FORECAST TO BE MOVING OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST.

INITIAL INTENSITY IS 50 KNOTS...BASED ON AVERAGE ESTIMATES FROM TAFB
AND SAB.  FLOYD HAS BANDING FEATURES...EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND A LARGE
LOW-LEVEL CYCLONIC ENVELOPE BUT IT LACKS AN INNER CORE.  UNTIL AN
INNER CORE FORMS...AND THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF THIS FEATURE FORMING AT
THIS TIME...NO RAPID STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR.  SHIPS AND
GFDL INSIST ON BRINGING THE HURRICANE TO 93 AND 101 KNOTS
RESPECTIVELY BY 72 HOURS.  THESE MODELS ARE THE ONLY OPERATIONAL
TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR INTENSITY AT THE TIME OF THE FORECAST. 
THEREFORE...FLOYD IS FORECAST TO REACH 95 KNOTS BY 72 HOURS...AFTER
A SLOW STRENGTHENING DURING THE FIRST 24 HOURS.  IF THE INNER CORE
DOES NOT FORM...THE RAPID INTENSIFICATION WILL NOT TAKE PLACE. 

SINCE THE CENTER IS NOT WELL ORGANIZED...THE INITIAL MOTION IS
UNCERTAIN BUT BEST ESTIMATE IS 285/14.   THIS IS BASED ON SATELLITE
FIXES A LITTLE TO THE SOUTH OF EARLIER POSITIONS.  WATER VAPOR
IMAGES SHOW A LARGE UPPER-TROUGH/SHEAR AXIS EXTENDING FROM THE
CENTRAL CARIBBEAN TO A LOW NEAR BERMUDA.  THIS FEATURE SHOULD FORCE
FLOYD TO TURN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST IN A DAY OR TWO.  THEREAFTER...
ANOTHER LARGE TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO BE ALONG THE EASTERN
UNITED STATES WILL LIKELY TURN FLOYD TO THE NORTH.  THE LATEST GFDL
SUGGESTS THAT THE WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH 72
HOURS...A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS INTEGRATION AND
THE UK MODEL INDICATES A RECURVATURE MORE TO THE WEST THAN IN
EARLIER RUN. THE AVN HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN TURNING THE TROPICAL
CYCLONE GRADUALLY NORTHWARD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO
LBAR...WHICH IS GOOD IN THE DEEP TROPICS AND THE GFDL BUT STILL ON
THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE TRACK MODEL ENSEMBLE. 

ON THIS TRACK...FLOYD WILL BE PASSING NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS
BUT ONLY A SMALL DEVIATION TO THE LEFT...COULD BRING A PORTION OF
THE CIRCULATION OVER THE NORTHERNMOST ISLANDS. INTERESTS
IN THE NORTHERN LEEWARD SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF FLOYD.

AN AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE AREA
EARLY MORNING.  THEN...WE WILL HAVE GOOD MEASUREMENTS OF THE
INTENSITY AND LOCATION.

ON THEIR FIRST MISSION INTO FLOYD...THE AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS
FOUND THAT THE STORM IS PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK...BUT THAT THE PREVIOUS
INTENSITY ESTIMATES WERE A BIT ON THE HIGH SIDE.  ON TWO DROPS INTO
THE EYE...THE HURRICANE HUNTERS MEASURED 1002 AND 1003 MB.  SURFACE
WIND MEASUREMENTS AT THE DROPWINSONDE SPLASH POINTS SUGGEST THAT
NEITHER DROP WAS QUITE AT THE SURFACE CENTER POSITION HOWEVER. 
ALTHOUGH THE FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS DO NOT SUPPORT AS STRONG A STORM AS
WE THOUGHT...FOR THE SAKE OF CONTINUITY...THE CURRENT INTENSITY IS
KEPT AT 50 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  ON THE LARGE SCALE...THE CLOUD
PATTERN CONTINUES TO LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH STRONG UPPER-LEVEL
OUTFLOW EVIDENT.  RECENT GOES-8 IMAGES AFTER THE SATELLITE ECLIPSE
SHOW THE CONVECTION CONSOLIDATING AND INTENSIFYING OVER THE
CENTER... SUGGESTING THAT THE INNER CORE MAY BE GETTING BETTER
ORGANIZED.  IF THIS IS THE CASE...THEN STRENGTHENING AT A MORE RAPID
RATE MAY COMMENCE SOON.

INITIAL MOTION...285/13 IS ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE.  A SLIGHT
NORTHWARD ADJUSTMENT IS MADE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...BUT
THE PROGNOSTIC REASONING IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.  THE MID-
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF THE STORM IS PREDICTED TO
GRADUALLY WEAKEN WITH TIME...THUS THE NHC FORECAST SHOWS SOME
SLOWING OF FORWARD SPEED AND A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.   
THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTIONS AS WELL...AND
KEEPS FLOYD TO THE NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.  HOWEVER...IF THE
STORM DOES NOT TURN MORE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...A PORTION OF FLOYDS
LARGE CIRCULATION COULD AFFECT THE NORTHERNMOST OF THESE ISLANDS. 
INTERESTS IN THE NORTHERN LEEWARD SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC FLOW OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
DURING THE NEXT 3 TO 5 DAYS IS CRITICAL FOR THE LONGER-RANGE TRACK
OF FLOYD.  IF THE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES LIFTS OUT LATER
THIS WEEKEND...THEN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY
RECURVE...OR EVEN TURN BACK TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST OR WEST. 
THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION OF THIS IN THE LATEST RUNS OF THE GFDL AND
AVN MODELS.  AT THIS JUNCTURE...THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
SPECULATION.

FLOYD IS LOOKING MUCH STRONGER ON SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS
MORNING...WITH A VERY COLD CDO.  DVORAK INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM
TAFB AND SAB ARE 65 KT...HURRICANE STRENGTH.  HOWEVER...AIR FORCE
RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE LAST NIGHT FOUND THAT THE WINDS WERE NOT AS
HIGH AS THE SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS.  OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS HELD
AT 50 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.  ANOTHER AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN THE SYSTEM
THIS AFTERNOON.  FLOYD APPEARS POISED TO UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTHENING.  
 
THE INITIAL MOTION OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS HAS BEEN DUE WESTWARD...
BUT THE LONGER TERM MOTION USED TO INITIALIZE THE MODELS WAS 280/12. 
ALL MODEL GUIDANCE TAKES FLOYD TO THE NORTH OF THE ISLANDS...FAR
ENOUGH THAT NO WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME. 
HOWEVER...IF THE WESTWARD MOTION CONTINUES MUCH LONGER...THEY MAY BE
NECESSARY THIS AFTERNOON.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED
SOUTHWARD OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND IS BETWEEN THE LBAR AND
GFDL.  FOR THE LONGER TERM...OF INTEREST IS THE WESTWARD BEND IN THE
GFDL AND LBAR LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THERE ARE HINTS THAT THE
MAJOR TROUGH NOW APPROACHING THE U.S. EAST COAST MAY NOT BE
SUFFICIENT TO RECURVE FLOYD.

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATING
FLOYD THIS AFTERNOON HAS PRESENTED US WITH MIXED SIGNALS.  THE
CENTER LOCATED BY THE AIRCRAFT WAS NORTHWEST OF THE PREVIOUS
SATELLITE ESTIMATES...AND REMOVED FROM THE DEEP CONVECTION.  ON THE
OTHER HAND...THE AIRCRAFT ALSO FOUND 68 KT AT FLIGHT LEVEL ON THE
NORTHEAST SIDE...SO THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS RAISED TO 60 KT FOR
THIS PACKAGE.  GIVEN THE SEPARATION OF THE CENTER FROM THE
CONVECTION...NOT MUCH MORE SHORT TERM STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY. 
HOWEVER...THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL FORECASTS A 103 KT HURRICANE IN
72 HOURS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THIS GUIDANCE.

THE WESTWARD MOTION NOTED THIS MORNING HAS ENDED.  WITH THE AIRCRAFT
FIXES...THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW BACK TO THE RIGHT...AT 290/13. 
THE 12Z AVIATION MODEL INITIALIZES THE CYCLONE WITH SOME STRANGE-
LOOKING SIDE LOBES OF VORTICITY.  THESE INDUCE A SHARP NORTHWARD...
AND THEN WESTWARD TURN IN THE MODEL OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THIS
DOES NOT SEEM REASONABLE AND I HAVE SMOOTHED OUT THESE WIGGLES TO
GIVE A WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST TRACK THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  

WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT RECONNAISSANCE
DATA.  ALTHOUGH THE FORECAST TRACK IS STILL NORTH OF THE
ISLANDS...GIVEN THESE RADII AND THE TYPICAL ERROR IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST...A TROPICAL STORM WATCH IS NOW REQUIRED FOR THE
NORTHEASTERN-MOST LEEWARD ISLANDS.

DESPITE THE APPARENT FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR STRENGTHENING...FLOYD
HAS NOT REACHED HURRICANE STATUS YET.  YES...ON IR IMAGERY...FLOYD
IS VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH EXCELLENT OUTFLOW...VERY DEEP CONVECTION AND
BANDING FEATURES.  IN FACT...T-NUMBERS FROM SAB...TAFB AND KGWC ARE
4.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...SUGGESTING THAT FLOYD IS A HURRICANE. 
HOWEVER... SEVERAL PASSES THROUGH THE CENTER OF FLOYD BY AN AIR
FORCE RECONNAISSANCE PLANE INDICATE THAT THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS
DECOUPLED FROM THE MID-LEVEL ROTATION OBSERVED IN IR IMAGERY. 
NEITHER THE PRESSURE NOR THE WINDS REPORTED SO FAR BY THE
PLANE...CONFIRM THAT FLOYD IS A HURRICANE. I DO NOT HAVE AN
EXPLANATION WHY STRENGTHENING HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET...BUT I AM
SURE THERE WILL BE MANY EXPLANATIONS OUT THERE LATER.  GIVEN THE
CURRENT SEPARATION OF THE LOW AND MID LEVEL CENTERS...NO SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS. 
THEREAFTER...INTENSIFICATION SHOULD BEGIN AS INDICATED BY SHIPS AND
THE GFDL MODELS AND PREVIOUS FORECAST.

FLOYD HAS SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS 285/9. 
THE TRACK IN THE SHORT TERM...WILL PROBABLY BE CONTROLLED BY A WELL
DEFINED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH/SHEAR AXIS EXTENDING FROM HISPANIOLA
NORTHWARD THROUGH THE ATLANTIC AS OBSERVED IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.
THIS TROUGH MAY FORCE FLOYD ON A TRACK MORE TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST
AND EVEN NORTHWEST DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...THE
STEERING PATTERN BECOMES MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE GLOBAL MODELS ARE
BEGINNING TO HINT THAT A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC.  THIS FORECAST PATTERN WOULD FAVOR A MORE WEST OR
WEST-NORTHWESTERLY TRACK INSTEAD OF A NORTHWARD TURN OVER OPEN
WATERS.  THIS IS BASED ON SEVERAL RELIABLE MODELS LIKE
LBAR...GFDL...AND THE AVN WHICH TURN FLOYD WESTWARD BY THE END OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.  IN ADDITION...THE UK MODEL SUGGESTS A 
NORTHWARD TURN FARTHER TO THE WEST IN EACH UPDATED RUN.  SINCE
MODELS COULD CHANGE AGAIN TO A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK IN THE NEXT
RUN....THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS NOT CHANGED AND CONTINUES ON A
GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK...MOVING FLOYD NORTH OF THE LEEWARD
ISLANDS AND THEN BENDS THE TRACK A LITTLE TO THE WEST BEYOND 48
HOURS.

LATEST OBSERVATIONS BY THE AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS SHOW A
CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 985 MB WHICH INDICATES THAT FLOYD IS PROBABLY
STRENGTHENING AND WILL LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO A HURRICANE VERY
SOON...ASSUMING THIS IS CORROBORATED BY WIND OBSERVATIONS FROM THE
AIRCRAFT.  THE LAST FIX LOCATION ALSO SHOWS A BIT OF A NORTHWARD
JUMP...INTO A MASS OF DEEP CONVECTION DEPICTED ON SATELLITE IMAGES.
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO BE IMPRESSIVE AND STRENGTHENING IS
FORECAST.  FLOYD COULD BE A MAJOR HURRICANE BY THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD.
 
INITIAL MOTION...300/10...IS A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF PREVIOUS
ESTIMATES.  A SYNOPTIC SURVEILLANCE MISSION BY THE NOAA JET SHOWS A
SLIGHT WEAKNESS IN THE 500 MB RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF FLOYD AND THIS
HAS LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED OVER THE
LAST 12 HOURS OR SO...AND TO THE SLIGHT RIGHTWARD CHANGE IN HEADING.

THERE IS AN UNREALISTIC-LOOKING RING OF VORTICITY SURROUNDING FLOYD
IN THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL INITIALIZATION.  IN THE MODEL SIMULATION...
A NEW VORTEX SPINS UP ALONG THE RING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF STORM AND
MAY HAVE SOME EFFECT ON THE AVN PREDICTED MOVEMENT OF FLOYD...
PERHAPS CARRYING IT TOO FAR TO THE NORTH.  LOOKING AT THE LARGER-
SCALE STEERING MECHANISMS...THE LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER
THE EASTERN STATES IS LIKELY TO LIFT OUT IN A COUPLE OF DAYS OR SO.
THEREAFTER THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS A RIDGE BUILDING WESTWARD
INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES AROUND THE 72 HOUR TIME FRAME. IF THIS
VERIFIES...THEN A MORE WESTWARD COMPONENT OF MOTION WOULD DEVELOP
NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THIS IS WHAT IS BEING DEPICTED
BY RECENT RUNS OF THE GFDL MODEL...WHICH TURN FLOYD SHARPLY TOWARD
THE WEST AFTER 48 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DOES SHOW A LEFTWARD
BEND NEAR THE END OF THE PERIOD...NOT AS DRAMATIC AS THE GFDL BUT
SIMILAR TO THE U.K. MET. OFFICE MODEL WHICH HAS BEEN AN EXCELLENT

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT REPORTED FLIGHT-
LEVEL WINDS OF 88 KT THIS MORNING.  THIS SUPPORTS A SURFACE WIND
ESTIMATE OF 70 KT AND FLOYD IS NOW A HURRICANE.  WIND RADII HAVE
BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON A SURFACE WIND ANALYSIS PROVIDED BY THE NOAA
HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION.  THEIR ANALYSIS ALSO INDICATES A 
MAXIMUM SURFACE WIND OF ABOUT 70 KT.

FLOYD CONTINUES TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY CONSOLIDATING ITS INNER
CORE...AND THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER OF CIRCULATION IS STILL NOT QUITE
CO-LOCATED WITH THE CONVECTION OR MID-LEVEL ROTATION.  THE MOST
RECENT MSLP WAS 989 MB...UP A BIT FROM EARLIER.  THIS PROBABLY
REFLECTS THE POOR INNER ORGANIZATION RATHER THAN A WEAKENING TREND. 
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW REMAINS IMPRESSIVE...IF A BIT RESTRICTED ON THE
NORTHWEST SIDE.  THE SHIPS AND GFDL INTENSITY GUIDANCE BRINGS FLOYD
TO CLOSE TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS IN THREE DAYS.  THE AVN DEVELOPS
AN UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE NORTH OF FLOYD DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD
THAT SHOULD PROVIDE A LONGER TERM ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE FOR
STRENGTHENING.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/9.  A SYNOPTIC SURVEILLANCE MISSION BY THE
NOAA JET LAST NIGHT SHOWS A SLIGHT WEAKNESS IN THE 500 MB RIDGE TO
THE NORTH OF FLOYD AND THIS HAS LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE
IN FORWARD SPEED COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.  THE NCEP CLOBAL MODEL AT
06Z CONTINUES TO ANALYZE AN UNREALISTIC-LOOKING RING OF VORTICITY
SURROUNDING FLOYD...WHICH APPEARS TO INDUCE A NORTHWARD TRACK
DEFLECTION IN THE MODEL FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM.  THIS IS
DISCOUNTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WHICH CALLS FOR A WEST-NORTHWEST
TRACK FOR 48 HOURS.  BEYOND THAT...THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER
THE EASTERN U.S. IS FORECAST TO LIFT OUT...LEAVING A CUTOFF LOW IN
THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND STRONG RIDGING NORTH OF THE CYCLONE. 
IF THIS SCENARIO VERIFIES...A MORE WESTWARD TRACK IS LIKELY AT 72

THE WINDS TO CATCH UP TO THE IMPROVED STRUCTURE SOON.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL BRINGS FLOYD TO CATEGORY THREE ON THE

THE SHORT-TERM MOTION OF THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER HAS BEEN TO THE NORTH-

AT THIS TIME.  FLOYD IS WELL ORGANIZED WITH AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND
VERY DEEP CONVECTION NEAR THE CENTER.  HOWEVER...THE HURRICANE HAS
TO MOVE THROUGH THE MID-UPPER OCEANIC TROUGH....CLEARLY OBSERVED ON
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY... DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THIS FEATURE
IS ALSO DEPICTED BY RAOBS FROM THE CARIBBEAN WHICH REPORTED
SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS...AT 300 MB BLOWING INTO THE HURRICANE.  IN
ADDITION...THE AVN DEVELOPS A 200 MB NORTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS...RESULTING IN A SHEARING
ENVIRONMENT.   THEREFORE...SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE LIKELY
DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...ONCE FLOYD MOVES AWAY
FROM THE UPPER-TROUGH...STRENGTHENING SHOULD START AGAIN.

INITIAL MOTION IS 310/10.  UNANIMOUSLY...DYNAMICAL MODELS TURN THE
HURRICANE ON A TRACK MORE TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST AND EVEN WESTWARD.
THIS DEVIATION TO THE LEFT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT A STRONG WARM
RIDGE...WHICH IS VERY STRONG AT MID TO UPPER-LEVELS OVER THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC AND THE LACK OF TROUGH IN THE FORECAST ALONG EAST COAST OF
THE UNITED STATES.  THE RELIABLE UK MODEL IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE IN
TURNING THE HURRICANE WESTWARD AND LOCATES FLOYD NEAR THE CENTRAL
BAHAMAS IN THREE DAYS AND VERY NEAR CENTRAL FLORIDA IN FIVE DAYS. 
NEVERTHELESS...THE CURRENT TREND OF ALL THE LONG RANGE MODELS IS A
TRACK TOWARD THE U.S. EAST COAST INSTEAD OF A NORTHWARD TURN OVER
OPEN WATERS.  THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

GIVEN THESE TRENDS...RESIDENTS ALONG THE U.S EAST COAST SHOULD
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF FLOYD DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

HURRICANE FLOYD DISCUSSION NUMBER  15
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT SAT SEP 11 1999
 
THE LATEST REPORT RELAYED FROM THE AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE PRESSURE HAS CONTINUED TO FALL THIS
MORNING AND THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE IS NOW 963 MB...A 31 MB
DROP DURING THE LAST 24 HRS.  THEY ALSO REPORTED A 25 NMI CIRCULAR
EYE...OPEN TO THE SOUTH.  MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 107 KTS
WERE RECORDED IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT.  THUS...THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS RAISED TO 90 KTS FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE OVERALL CLOUD
PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH FLOYD REMAINS HEALTHY WITH VERY DEEP
CONVECTION PERSISTING AROUND THE CENTER...TOPS TO -70 TO -80C.
HOWEVER...THE OUTFLOW IS BEING DISRUPTED SOMEWHAT OVER THE SOUTHERN
SEMICIRCLE OF THE HURRICANE BY THE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE EASTERN
CARIBBEAN.  THE HURRICANE WILL BE MOVING THROUGH THE MID TO UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH...SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY TO THE WEST OF THE
CYCLONE...DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HRS. THIS COUPLED WITH NORTHWESTERLY
SHEAR...DEPICTED IN THE AVIATION MODEL AND REFLECTED IN THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST...WILL LIKELY CAUSE SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY THROUGH 36 HRS.  THEREAFTER...CONDITIONS SHOULD BECOME
FAVORABLE FOR ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
BRINGS FLOYD TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS BY 72 HRS. 

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 310/09 KTS. THE FUTURE MOTION OF
FLOYD WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE
MID-LEVEL TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL LIFT OUT
DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HRS WITH THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWING A
RIDGE BUILDING WESTWARD INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. BY 48 HRS.
ALL OF THE DYNAMIC-BASED TRACK GUIDANCE REMAINS TIGHTLY CLUSTERED 
ON A WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION BETWEEN 24 AND 48 HRS WITH A MORE
WESTWARD HEADING THEREAFTER. THE UKMET REMAINS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE
MODEL WITH REGARDS TO THE WESTWARD MOTION. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK BENDS FLOYD BACK TO A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST HEADING AFTER 
12 HRS...WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST BY 48 HR.  THIS TRACK IS
VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
BEYOND 72 HRS...THE FORECAST UNCERTAINTY INCREASES CONSIDERABLY
AS THE NEXT MID-LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES THE EASTERN U.S. AND
WEAKENS THE RIDGE. THE UKMET MODEL TURNS THE HURRICANE BACK TO
THE NORTHWEST JUST OFF THE FLORIDA COAST IN FOUR DAYS AND ENDS UP
OFF THE GEORGIA COAST IN FIVE DAYS. NOGAPS IS SIMILAR ALTHOUGH IT
MAKES THE TURN BACK TO THE NORTHWEST EAST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS.
ALL INTERESTS ALONG THE U.S. EAST COAST SHOULD CONTINUE TO CLOSELY
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF FLOYD DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT SAT SEP 11 1999
 
DATA FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT EARLIER
THIS MORNING REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 962 MB...WHICH
SUGGESTS THE INTENSITY MAY BE LEVELING OFF SOMEWHAT.  PEAK FLIGHT
LEVEL WINDS WERE 107 KT...AND A DROPSONDE IN THE NORTHEAST EYEWALL
REPORTED SURFACE WINDS OF 100 KT.  SINCE DATA FROM A SINGLE
DROPSONDE MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SUSTAINED WIND...I AM
WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE MAKING FLOYD A
CATEGORY THREE HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 95 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.

THE OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO BE DISRUPTED SOMEWHAT IN THE SOUTHWEST
QUADRANT BY AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN.  WATER-
VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A SMALL UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IMMEDIATELY TO THE
WEST OF FLOYD.  THESE FEATURES MAY INHIBIT SIGNIFICANT STRENTHENING
OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THEREAFTER...CONDITIONS SHOULD BECOME
FAVORABLE FOR ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
BRINGS FLOYD TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS IN 48 HRS.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 305/09...JUST A BIT TO THE LEFT OF
THE PREVIOUS MOTION.  THE FUTURE MOTION OF FLOYD DEPENDS ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC
DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS A BIT LESS TIGHTLY
CLUSTERED THAN EARLIER...WITH THE LBAR AND GFDL SHOWING LESS OF A
WESTWARD TURN.  THE FIVE DAY GFDL TURNS THE HURRICANE TO THE
NORTHWEST...BRINGING FLOYD TO THE CAROLINAS IN FIVE DAYS.  THE MRF
LAST NIGHT...ON THE OTHER HAND...TAKES FLOYD INTO SOUTH FLORIDA. 
THIS ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFICULTY OF SPECIFYING LANDFALL BEYOND THREE
DAYS TIME.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY BUT WITH A SLIGHTLY SLOWER SPEED AT THE END OF THE PERIOD
DUE TO AN ANTICIPATED WEAKENING OF THE STEERING CURRENTS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT SAT SEP 11 1999
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON SHOWS THE REEMERGENCE OF AN
EYE...INDICATING THAT FLOYD IS GETTING BETTER ORGANIZED. 
HOWEVER...THE MOST RECENT RECONNAISSANCE DATA DO NOT SHOW ANY
INCREASE IN STRENGTH YET.  THE OUTFLOW IS IMPROVING SOMEWHAT AS THE
SMALL UPPER LOW NOTED EARLIER HAS ROTATED SOUTHWEST OF THE
HURRICANE.  THIS SHOULD BE A MORE FAVORABLE CONFIGURATION AND FLOYD
SHOULD REACH MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS TONIGHT OR TOMORROW.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/10...AGAIN A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS MOTION.  THE PAST FEW VISIBLE IMAGES SHOW A DUE WEST MOTION
BUT I EXPECT THIS TO BE A TEMPORARY JOG.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE HURRICANE...AS
FORECAST OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS SHOULD KEEP FLOYD ON A
GENERALLY WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS OR SO.  BEYOND
THAT...THE 00Z MRF AND 12Z AVN BRING THE HURRICANE TO THE SOUTH
FLORIDA COAST...WHILE THE UKMET HAS DONE AN ABOUT FACE AND RECURVES
FLOYD WITHOUT MAKING LANDFALL AT ALL.  IT IS CLEARLY TOO SOON TO
SPECIFY WHAT PORTION OF THE COAST IS AT GREATEST RISK FOR
LANDFALL...BUT ALL INTERESTS FROM FLORIDA THROUGH THE CAROLINAS
SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS HURRICANE. THE TRACK
WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE DEVELOPING
RIDGE AND THE APPROACHING MID-LATITUDE TROUGH NOW OVER THE WESTERN
U.S.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND HAS LESS OF A LEFTWARD BEND AT THE END OF THE

AS EXPECTED...FLOYD IS INTERACTING WITH A MIDDLE-LEVEL TROUGH...AND
CONSEQUENTLY...THE CLOUD PATTERN AND THE INNER CORE ARE DISRUPTED. 
MINIMUM PRESSURE HAS LEVELED OFF AT 967 MB AND MAX WINDS REMAIN 95
KNOTS OR MAYBE LOWER AT THIS TIME.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY
ARE LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS WHILE FLOYD IS INTERACTING

MODELS HAVE NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY TONIGHT...AND THEY ARE EVEN
MORE TIGHTLY-PACKED AND...ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY...MOVE THE HURRICANE ON

THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER RECENTLY REPORTED A MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 960 MB AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS OF 95 KT.
THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVER THE LAST 24 HRS AS
FLOYD HAS INTERACTED WITH THE MID-LEVEL TROUGH TO ITS WEST.
SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT CONDITIONS SEEM TO BE IMPROVING 
AND FLOYD MAY BEGIN TO STRENGTHEN LATER THIS MORNING.  NCEP GLOBAL
MODELS SHOW A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR STRENGTHENING...AND FORECAST
BRINGS FLOYD TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS BY 12 HRS.

THE LATEST RECONNAISSANCE FIXES SHOW A GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION OVER
THE LAST 6 HRS OR SO...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW
275/11. THE SYNOPTIC DATA GATHERED BY THE NOAA P-3 AIRCRAFT WAS
INCORPORATED INTO THE 00Z INITIALIZATION OF THE NCEP GLOBAL MODELS.
THE MID-LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE SHOULD KEEP IT ON A
GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH 24 HRS.  AFTER 24 HRS...A TROUGH WILL
MOVE INTO THE EASTERN U.S. AND WEAKEN THE RIDGE. ALL OF THE
OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH A GENERAL WEST...
THEN WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 36 HRS. THEREAFTER...THERE IS
SOME SCATTER WITH NOGAPS THE RIGHT-MOST OF THE DYNAMIC MODELS WHILE
THE AVIATION BRINGS THE HURRICANE TO THE FLORIDA COAST BETWEEN PALM
BEACH AND DAYTONA BEACH....AS DOES BAMD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST KEEPS
THE HURRICANE JUST OFFSHORE OF THE FLORIDA COAST AND IS VERY SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 

BASED ON THE FORECAST TRACK...THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BAHAMAS HAS
ISSUED A TROPICAL STORM WARNING FOR THE SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS AND THE
TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS...AND A HURRICANE WATCH FOR THE CENTRAL
BAHAMAS.  A HURRICANE WATCH WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED FOR THE
NORTHWEST BAHAMAS LATER TODAY. 
 
THERE ARE INDICATIONS FROM THE LONGER RANGE MODELS...UKMET AND

FLOYD HAS CONTINUED TO INTENSIFY THIS MORNING WITH THE LATEST AIR
FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT REPORTING A MINIMUM CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 922 MB...A 39 MB DROP OVER THE LAST 24 HRS. THE MAXIMUM
FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND...700 MB...WAS 146 KTS IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT
WHILE DROPSONDE DATA SHOW A MAXIMUM WIND OF 168 KTS. THUS...THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 135 KTS FOR THIS ADVISORY WHICH
MAKES FLOYD A STRONG CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE.
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY DEPICTS A CLASSIC HURRICANE WITH AN EXTREMELY
WELL-DEFINED EYE AND THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW IS IMPRESSIVE.
THERE HAS BEEN AN EROSION OF THE COLD CLOUD TOPS OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE OF FLOYD. HOWEVER...THIS MAY BE A TEMPORARY CONDITION.
SST ANALYSES FROM JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY INDICATE THAT FLOYD IS
TRAVERSING A WARM EDDY...ABOUT 32C.  THERE WILL LIKELY BE SOME
FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HRS...MAINLY DUE 
TO EYE-WALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 280/12. THE SYNOPTIC REASONING

INTO PALM BEACH FLORIDA...THE AVIATION NEAR JACKSONVILLE...WHILE 
THE GLOBAL MODELS AND THE GFDL TURN THE SYSTEM NORTHWARD OVER THE
NORTHWEST BAHAMAS AND INDICATE LANDFALL IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA.
 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE

ON THIS TRACK...A HURRICANE WATCH IS BEING ISSUED FOR THE FLORIDA
EAST COAST FROM SOUTH OF FLAGLER BEACH TO HALLANDALE. THE GOVERNMENT
OF THE BAHAMAS IS ISSUING A HURRICANE WARNING FOR THE NORTHWEST
BAHAMAS.  ALL INTERESTS ELSEWHERE ALONG THE FLORIDA EAST COAST...

THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 280/12.  THE MODEL GUIDANCE ALSO REMAINS
BASICALLY UNCHANGED...CALLING FOR AN EROSION OF THE RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF FLOYD AND A GRADUAL TURN TOWARD THE NORTH.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY EXCEPT A
LITTLE FASTER AND NOW SHOWS THE CENTER CROSSING THE SOUTH CAROLINA
COAST AFTER 48 HOURS.
 
THERE ARE NO IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THE MOTION OF THE HURRICANE OR IN
THE TRACK GUIDANCE AND NONE OF THE GUIDANCE BRINGS THE HURRICANE
OVER SOUTHEAST FLORIDA.  HOWEVER SINCE FLOYD IS FORECAST TO MOVE
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO SOUTHEAST FLORIDA...AS PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE
...A HURRICANE WATCH IS EXTENDED SOUTHWARD TO INCLUDE DADE
COUNTY FLORIDA.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE
HURRICANE WATCH BE EXTENDED NORTHWARD TO JUST SOUTH OF BRUNSWICK
GEORGIA.
 
RECON FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS AND GPS DROPS IN THE EYEWALL SUPPORT 135
KNOTS SUSTAINED SURFACE WIND.  THE LATEST RECON CENTRAL SURFACE
PRESSURE IS 921 MB WHICH CORRELATES WITH 140 KNOTS...AND THE
HURRICANE COULD EVEN GET A LITTLE STRONGER IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS.  HOWEVER 135 KNOTS SHOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO GET EVERYONES
ATTENTION.

MEDIUM BAM MODELS...CONTINUE TO SHOW A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST AND
NORTH OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN SOME

HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE NOW REQUIRED FOR ALL OF THE FLORIDA EAST

LAST RECONNAISSANCE REPORTS INDICATE THE CENTRAL PRESSURE CHANGING
LITTLE SO INTENSITY APPEARS TO BE HOLDING ABOUT STEADY.  FLOYD HAS A
FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL APPEARANCE WITH GOOD OUTFLOW OVER ALL BY THE
SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  A GPS DROPWINDSONDE RECENTLY MEASURED 152 KNOTS
ABOVE THE SURFACE TO THE NORTH OF THE CENTER.  NOT MUCH CHANGE IN
STRENGTH IS ANTICIPATED FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  LATER IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD...SOME WEAKENING MAY OCCUR AS THE HURRICANE ENTERS A
LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.
 
AFTER THE INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED NOTED EARLIER TODAY...THE MOTION
IS BACK TO AROUND 12 KNOTS.  SATELLITE AND AIRCRAFT FIXES SHOWED A
SLIGHT NORTHWESTWARD WOBBLE A FEW HOURS AGO...BUT THE HEADING IS
BACK TO 280 DEGREES NOW.  THE TRACK FORECAST REASONING REMAINS THE
SAME.  A MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHING THE EASTERN STATES
IS LIKELY TO ERODE THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH WHICH HAS BEEN
STEERING FLOYD WESTWARD.  THIS SHOULD CREATE MORE OF A NORTHWARD
STEERING CURRENT...AND FLOYD IS EXPECTED TO TURN NORTHWESTWARD
DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.   THIS WHAT HAS BEEN SHOWN BY MOST
OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS FOR SOME TIME NOW.  HOWEVER THE
CONTINUED WESTWARD MOTION MEANS THAT THE CORE OF THE HURRICANE COULD
COME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE FLORIDA COAST ON TUESDAY.  THIS IS WHY
HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE IN PLACE FROM DADE COUNTY NORTHWARD TO THE

RECENT FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT
INDICATE THAT THE ANTICIPATED WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION HAS BEGUN...
AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 290/12 KTS.  SATELLITE
IMAGERY SHOWS A NNW-SSE ELONGATION OF THE STORM ENVELOPE INDICATING
THAT FLOYD IS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THE APPROACHING MID-
UPPER LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH. THE TRACK FORECAST REASONING
REMAINS UNCHANGED AS THE MID TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHING THE
EASTERN U.S. WILL LIKELY ERODE THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH
WHICH HAS BEEN STEERING FLOYD WESTWARD.  THIS SHOULD CREATE MORE 
OF A NORTHWARD STEERING CURRENT...AND FLOYD IS EXPECTED TO TURN
NORTHWESTWARD DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A NORTHWARD
HEADING THROUGH 48 HRS.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS ARE IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO...AND IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST. THE NHC TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

THE LATEST MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE FROM THE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT
IS 928 MB...A 5 MB RISE OVER THE LAST 24 HRS. THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT-
LEVEL WINDS WERE 119 KTS WHILE THE GPS DROPSONDE RECORDED A MAXIMUM
OF 133 KTS.  RECON DATA SHOWS A DOUBLE WIND MAX STRUCTURE SUGGESTING
THAT A CONCENTRIC EYEWALL CYCLE MAY BE UNDERWAY.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 135 KTS.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT
THE HURRICANE REMAINS VERY SYMMETRIC AND GOOD OUTFLOW PERSISTS IN
ALL BUT THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT. ALTHOUGH SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY ARE LIKELY...LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH IS EXPECTED DURING
THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  THEREAFTER...THE NCEP GLOBAL MODELS ALONG WITH
THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL INDICATE THAT THE UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE WILL
MOVE EAST RESULTING IN SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR OVER FLOYD
WHICH SHOULD GRADUALLY WEAKEN THE HURRICANE.  THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE LAST FORECAST PACKAGE AND THE SHIPS INTENSITY SCHEME...
ALTHOUGH NOT AS DRAMATIC.   

AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BAHAMAS...THE TROPICAL
STORM WARNING FOR THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS IS DISCONTINUED.  THE
WARNING FOR THE SOUTHEASTERN BAHAMAS WILL LIKELY BE LOWERED LATER
THIS MORNING.

REGARDLESS OF THE WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION...HURRICANE FLOYD WILL STILL
COME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE EAST FLORIDA COAST.  ALL PREPARATIONS
SHOULD BE RUSHED TO COMPLETION IN THE WARNING AREA.

ARE LIKELY...BUT SINCE FLOYD IS LIKELY TO CROSS PORTIONS OF THE GULF
STREAM DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO IT SHOULD MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT
INTENSITY PRIOR TO LANDFALL.
 
THE LATEST RECON FIXES SHOW THAT FLOYD IS NOW MOVING NORTH-
NORTHWESTWARD AND IS MOVING A BIT FASTER...WITH THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE NOW 335/13 KT.  THE MID- TO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN U.S. WILL IMPART A MORE NORTHERLY HEADING LATER TODAY.

RECENT CENTER FIXES SHOW THAT THE FORWARD SPEED IS BEGINNING TO
INCREASE...AND MOTION IS NOW 020/16.  FLOYD IS BEGINNING TO GET
CAUGHT UP IN THE SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING FLOW OVER THE EASTERN
STATES.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY
FARTHER TO THE EAST FROM THE PREVIOUS ONE AND IS IN REASONABLE
AGREEMENT WITH MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE SUITE.  THIS TAKES THE
CENTER INLAND OVER EXTREME EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA DURING THE NEXT 6
TO 12 HOURS.   ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THIS EXACT TRACK BECAUSE...(A)
FLOYD HAS A LARGE CORE OF STRONG WINDS...AND (B) ONLY SLIGHT CHANGES
IN HEADING COULD MAKE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE LANDFALL POINT.

LATEST SURFACE WIND ESTIMATES FROM A NEW INSTRUMENT...THE STEPPED-
FREQUENCY MICROWAVE RADIOMETER...SUGGEST THAT FLOYD IS STILL NEAR
THE BOTTOM END OF CAT. 3 STATUS.  SLIGHT WEAKENING WILL PROBABLY
OCCUR BEFORE LANDFALL.  

RADAR OBSERVATIONS SHOWED A MESOCYCLONE ROTATING AROUND THE NORTHERN
PORTION OF THE EYE...AND SUCH FEATURES CAN PRODUCE LOCAL
ENHANCEMENTS TO THE WINDS.

HURRICANE FLOYD DISCUSSION NUMBER  35
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT THU SEP 16 1999

...CORRECTION TO PARAGRAPH ONE AND TWO...
 
FLOYD IS NOW INLAND OVER EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA AND THE INITIAL
MOTION ESTIMATE IS 030/19 KT...BASED ON RECON FIXES FROM THE AIR
FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT AND RADAR FIXES FROM THE 
NWS WILMINGTON WSR-88D RADAR.  THE HURRICANE SHOULD ACCELERATE AS 
IT IS STEERED ON A NORTH-NORTHEAST...THEN NORTHEAST TRACK FOR THE 
NEXT 24-36 HOURS BY THE SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH.  THE SYSTEM SHOULD TURN TO A MORE EAST-
NORTHEAST HEADING BEYOND 36 HOURS.   THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK 
IS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND
IS IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE. 
THIS TRACK TAKES THE CENTER INLAND OVER EXTREME EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA DURING THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS AND REEMERGES OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC WITH A POSITION JUST OFF THE EASTERN TIP OF LONG
ISLAND NEW YORK BY 24 HRS.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONE MUST
NOT FOCUS ON THIS EXACT TRACK BECAUSE FLOYD WILL RETAIN A LARGE 
CORE OF STRONG WINDS.

THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA DOPPLER-ON-WHEELS (DOW) TEAM RECORDED A
MAX SUSTAINED WIND OF 81 MPH...AND A PEAK GUST OF 123 MPH...AT
TOPSAIL BEACH NORTH CAROLINA NEAR THE TIME FLOYD MADE LANDFALL.  THE
NEW HANOVER COUNTY EOC RECORDED A PEAK SUSTAINED WIND OF 98 MPH WITH
A GUST TO 130 MPH ...AND A 971.9 MB PRESSURE...AT 05Z. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 90 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY. ADDITIONAL
WEAKENING IS LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 6-12 HRS AS FLOYD MOVES ACROSS
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA.  THEREAFTER FLOYD IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN A
CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE AS IT PASSES JUST EAST OF LONG ISLAND NEW YORK.

BASED ON THE NEW TRACK...HURRICANE WARNINGS HAVE BEEN EXTENDED
NORTHWARD TO THE NEW JERSEY COAST AND FROM EASTERN LONG ISLAND
NEW YORK TO PLYMOUTH MASSACHUSETTS.

THE CENTER OF THE HURRICANE WAS INLAND OVER EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA
AT 12Z MOVING 025/21.  AT 15Z THE CENTER SHOULD BE MOVING BACK OVER
WATER NEAR NORFOLK.  MOST OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWS AN ACCELERATION
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND THEN EAST OVER THE NEXT 3 DAYS...MOVING
ALONG THE NORTHEAST U.S COAST AND THEN THE CANADIAN MARITIME
PROVINCES.  THE FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO...AND AN UPDATE
OF...THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST.
 
THE STRONGEST SURFACE WIND REPORTED AT 12Z WAS 67 KNOTS SUSTAINED AT
DIAMOND SHOALS C-MAN...WHICH REDUCES TO 57 KNOTS AT 10 METERS.  THE
WAKEFIELD DOPPLER DOPPLER WINDS ARE 64 TO 75 KNOTS AT 2000 FT.  SO
THE MAXIMUM SURFACE WIND IS ESTIMATED AT 70 KNOTS AT 15Z AND FLOYD
IS FORECAST TO DROP BELOW HURRICANE STRENGTH WITH 60 KNOTS IN 12
HOURS.  THIS IS BASED ON FOLLOWING THE CURRENT WEAKENING TREND. 
MOST OF THE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS
SHOULD BE OFFSHORE OR RIGHT ON THE COAST...BUT NOT VERY FAR
INLAND...IF AT ALL.  EVEN THOUGH THE WINDS ARE FORECAST TO DROP
BELOW HURRICANE FORCE IN 12 HOURS...THE HURRICANE WARNINGS WILL NOT
BE CHANGED AT THIS TIME...DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN INTENSITY
FORECASTING.
 
THE RADAR PRESENTATION OF THE CIRCULATION CENTER HAS BECOME POOR AND
ONLY THREE-HOURLY INTERMEDIATE ADVISORIES WILL BE ISSUED.

CORRECTION...TROPICAL STORM FLOYD...NOT SUBTROPICAL
 
AN AIR FORCE RECON PLANE FIXED THE CENTER ON THE COAST AT THE MD/DEL
BORDER AT 1851Z.  THIS GIVES AN INITIAL MOTION 0F 025/26 AND IS A
LITTLE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...SO THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.  OTHERWISE THE
FORECAST CONTINIUES TO SHOW AN ACCELERATION TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND
EAST FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS...FOLLOWING A CONSENSUS OF THE MODEL
GUIDANCE.
 
THE AIRCRAFT MEASURED 70 TO 80 KNOTS AT 700 MB OVER THE
ATLANTIC...BUT A GPS DROP MEASURED ONLY 35 TO 40 KNOTS AT THE
SURFACE.  THE LAST SURFACE EVIDENCE OF HURRICANE WINDS WAS THE DUCK
PIER C-MAN AT 14Z.  THERE ARE SOME DOPPLER RADAR WINDS OF HURRICANE
FORCE OF THE DELMARVA PENINSULA...BUT THE SURFACE WINDS ARE BELIEVED
TO BE MUCH LESS.  SO FLOYD IS DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM AT 21Z
AND THE WARNINGS ALONG THE NORTHEAST U.S. COAST ARE ALSO DOWNGRADED
TO TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS.
 
THE MAIN THREAT NOW SHIFTS TO HEAVY RAINFALL AND VERY SERIOUS INLAND
FLOODING.

THE SYSTEM IS STARTING TO LOOK NON-TROPICAL...WITH AN ASYMMETRICAL
APPEARANCE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY. AND STRONG WINDS WELL AWAY FROM THE
CENTER.  FLOYD IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL IN 12 HOURS OR
SO.

THE STORM IS ACCELERATING AND INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 040/30. 
OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE SHOWS AN EASTWARD BEND WITH TIME WHICH IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE MORE ZONALLY-ORIENTED STEERING FLOW BETWEEN 45N-
50N.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS MORE OR LESS ALONG THE SAME
TRAJECTORY AS THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT A LITTLE FASTER BECAUSE OF THE
INCREASED INITIAL SPEED OF MOTION.

THERE IS STILL SOME THREAT FROM HEAVY RAINS BUT SINCE FLOYD IS NOW
MOVING SO SWIFTLY...IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DROP MUCH ADDITIONAL RAIN
IN ANY ONE PLACE.

TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ARE MAINTAINED AROUND THE NEW ENGLAND AREA
AT THIS TIME.  FARTHER NORTH...SINCE THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE
EXTRATROPICAL VERY SOON...GALE WARNINGS ARE ISSUED.

THE CENTER OF FLOYD IS BECOMING DIFFICULT TO LOCATE USING EITHER
RADAR DATA OR SATELLITE IMAGERY. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT
FLOYD HAS SLOWED SOMEWHAT...AND THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOW 035/23 KT.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS AN
INITIAL NORTHEAST MOTION FOLLOWED BY A EAST-NORTHEAST TRACK AFTER 
12 HRS...WITH AN EASTWARD BEND BY 36 HRS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH
THE MORE ZONALLY-ORIENTED STEERING FLOW BETWEEN 45N-50N.  THE
CURRENT NHC FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...
BUT A TAD SLOWER DUE TO THE INITIAL FORWARD SPEED.
 
SATELLITE IMAGERY AND SURFACE DATA SHOWS THAT FLOYD CONTINUES
ITS TRANSITION TO AN EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE.  THE STRONGEST WINDS
REMAIN WELL REMOVED FROM THE CENTER....MAINLY TO THE SOUTH AND 
EAST. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT THE CENTER HAS BECOME
ELONGATED. FLOYD IS FORECAST TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL IN 12 HOURS.

AFTER COORDINATION WITH THE NWS OFFICES IN UPTON NY AND TAUNTON MA
...THE TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS FROM SANDY HOOK NEW JERSEY TO
MERRIMACK MASSACHUSETTS WILL BE DISCONTINUED.

THIS WILL BE THE LAST ADVISORY ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL HURRICANE
CENTER ON FLOYD.  FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS SYSTEM CAN BE FOUND 
IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC HIGH SEAS FORECAST PRODUCT ISSUED BY THE

TAFB AND SAB ARE 30 AND 25 KT RESPECTIVELY...AND THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY IS SET TO 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY.  THE LARGE DEPRESSION
HAS GOOD BANDING BUT NOT MUCH CONVECTION NEAR ITS POORLY DEFINED
CENTER.  OUTFLOW IS CURRENTLY RESTRICTED ON THE EAST SIDE DUE TO
SOME MODEST EASTERLY SHEAR...BUT THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL FORECASTS
THE SHEAR TO BE LOW AND BRINGS THE DEPRESSION TO HURRICANE STRENGH
WITHIN 48 HOURS.
 
INITIAL LOCATION IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE ILL-DEFINED CENTER...BUT
THE MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 280/16.  GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A SWIFT
WEST TO WEST-NORTHWESTWARD MOTION FOR 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL

11 PM EDT SUN SEP 12 1999

GERT REMAINS WELL-ORGANIZED...HOWEVER DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS FROM
TAFB MIAMI AND SAB WASHINGTON DO NOT YET JUSTIFY UPGRADING IT TO A
HURRICANE.  THE STORM IS CURRENTLY OVER 27 DEG C SSTS AND WILL BE 
PASSING OVER PROGRESSIVELY WARMER WATERS DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.
UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW IS WELL-ESTABLISHED OVER ALL BUT THE EASTERN
QUADRANT.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS SET AT 60 KNOTS AND STRENGTHENING IS
PREDICTED...AS IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  THIS IS ALSO IN REASONABLE
AGREEMENT WITH THE STATISTICAL INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS.

BASED ON RECENT CENTER FIXES...THE MOTION CONTINUES TOWARD THE WEST
AT JUST A SLIGHTLY SLOWER FORWARD SPEED...17 KNOTS.  THE TRACK
FORECAST PHILOSOPHY IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED.  A MID-TROPOSPHERIC
RIDGE IS LIKELY TO PERSIST TO THE NORTH OF GERT FOR THE NEXT FEW
DAYS...AND THIS SUPPORTS A CONTINUATION OF A SLIGHTLY NORTH OF
WESTWARD MOTION FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  IN THE LATTER PART OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD...THE GFDL AND GLOBAL MODEL GUIDANCE  SUGGESTS A
MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION AND SOME SLOWING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS VERY CLOSE TO THE LBAR MODEL WHICH...WITH ITS BAROTROPIC
DYNAMICS...SHOULD HANDLE SYSTEMS IN THE DEEP TROPICS QUITE WELL.

INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT GERT IS NEAR HURRICANE
STRENGTH. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM SAB...TAFB...AND AFWA
ARE 65 KT...55 KT...AND 55 KT RESPECTIVELY. A WARM SPOT IS PRESENT
NEAR THE CENTER...BUT IS NOT YET GOOD ENOUGH LOOKING TO CALL AN EYE.
THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS REMAIN AT 60 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION REMAINS 275/17. THE SYNOPTIC SITUATION IS
STRAIGHT FORWARD...WITH A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE NORTH OF THE
STORM THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE IS SPLIT
INTO TWO CAMPS...WITH THE UKMET...BAMM...BAMS...AVN...AND CLIPER
BEING FASTER AND A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH. THE GFDL...BAMD...AND LBAR
ARE SLOWER AND FURTHER SOUTH. THE FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THE FIRST
GROUP AND IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

GERT HAS STRONG CONVECTION AND GOOD OUTFLOW OVER THE WESTERN
SEMICIRCLE. FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS LIKELY ALONG THE LINES OF THE
SHIPS MODEL...WITH THE SYSTEM BECOMING A HURRICANE LATER TODAY AND
NEAR MAJOR HURRICANE INTENSITY BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
ONE POSSIBLE INHIBITING FACTOR IS THAT THE AVN AND NOGAPS DEVELOP A
STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN TROPICAL
ATLANTIC THAT COULD CREATE NORTHERLY SHEAR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST
IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BASED ON THE PREMISES THAT GERT
IS LIKELY TO BECOME A HURRICANE BEFORE THIS HAPPENS...AND COULD WELL
BE FAR ENOUGH WEST TO ESCAPE THE WORST OF THE SHEAR.

OVER THE EYE...OBSCURING IT.  SATELLITE T-NUMBERS REMAIN THE SAME AS

SINCE THE GFDL MODEL STILL WANTS TO INTENSIFY THE SYSTEM TO OVER 100
KNOTS THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.
 
BECAUSE OF THE BURSTING PATTERN THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE
INITIAL POSITION AND IT APPEARS THAT THE SYSTEM HAS SLOWED.  THE
INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 280/14. A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE NORTH OF

NOW THAT THE EYE HAS RE-FORMED...THE INITIAL MOTION IS LESS
UNCERTAIN AND IS ESTIMATED TO BE 285/13. THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN IS
UNCHANGED FROM 24 HOURS AGO...WITH GERT CONTINUING WEST TO WEST-
NORTHWEST UNDER THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. SEVERAL HURRICANE GUIDANCE
MODELS...MOST NOTABLY THE NOGAPS AND THE BAMM...HAVE A TURN TOWARD
THE NORTHWEST DUE TO A WEAKENING RIDGE NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. SOME OF THIS WEAKENING APPEARS DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF
HURRICANE FLOYD IN THE MODELS...WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT
IMPLIES. THUS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED ONLY SLIGHTLY
NORTHWARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. WHILE THE 72 HOUR POINT IS
NORTH OF THE LESSER ANTILLES...GERT COULD STILL BE A THREAT TO THAT
AREA IF THE STORM MOVES MORE TO THE WEST THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.

THE SHIPS MODEL WANTS TO DEVELOP 20-25 KT VERTICAL WIND SHEAR OVER
GERT BY 36-48 HOURS...AND THUS ONLY INTENSIFIES IT TO 105 KT. A LOOK
AT THE AVN AND NOGAPS 200 MB WIND FIELDS DOES NOT INDICATE THAT
STRONG OF SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM. THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS THUS A
LITTLE STRONG THAN BOTH SHIPS AND THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE LONGER RANGE FORECAST OF GERT IS STILL UNCERTAIN. SEVERAL OF THE
GLOBAL MODELS TURN THE HURRICANE NORTHWARD NEAR 60W. HOWEVER...THIS
SEEM TO BE AT LEAST IN PART DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF FLOYD IN THE
MODELS. THUS...THESE FORECASTS NEED TO BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT

GUIDANCE RESPONDS TO THIS BY TURNING THE HURRICANE NORTHWEST BY 72
HOURS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THIS IDEA...BUT IS ALONG
THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE GUIDANCE. THIS IN CASE THE WEAKNESS IS NOT
AS PRONOUNCED AS CURRENTLY FORECAST...OR IN CASE THE HURRICANE
ITSELF BUILDS THE RIDGE FARTHER WESTWARD.
 
GERT CURRENTLY SHOWS GOOD OUTFLOW IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THIS COMBINED
WITH THE STILL-DEVELOPING EYE AND COLD CONVECTIVE TOPS INDICATES
CONTINUED STRENGTHENING...AT LEAST FOR A DAY OR SO. AFTER THAT
TIME...INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL LOW
MAY STOP DEVELOPMENT OR CAUSE A SLIGHT WEAKENING...AS SUGGESTED BY

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 PM EDT WED SEP 15 1999

...COR TO WRONG TEXT...

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT GERT HAS AN IMPRESSIVE CLOUD
PATTERN WITH AN EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A ROUND CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST
AND NUMEROUS BANDING FEATURES. THE OUTFLOW IS EXCELLENT IN ALL
QUADRANTS.  T-NUMBERS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 6.5 AND 7.0 ON THE
DVORAK SCALE.  THIS MAKES GERT A VERY STRONG CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE
ON THE SAFFIR/SIMPSON SCALE.  HURRICANES NORMALLY DO NOT KEEP SUCH
AN INTENSITY FOR A LONG TIME.  HENCE...FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE
EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 275/11. THE HURRICANE IS MOVING WESTWARD AROUND
THE PERIPHERY OF A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WHICH IS CONTROLLING THE
MOTION AT THIS TIME.  LATER...GERT WILL BE APPROACHING THE UPPER-
LOW PARTIALLY GENERATED BY THE OUTFLOW OF FLOYD.  THIS FEATURE...
WHICH IS CLEARLY OBSERVED ON WATER VAPOR IMAGES WILL PROBABLY FORCE
THE HURRICANE ON A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...AWAY FROM THE LEEWARD
ISLANDS.  THEREAFTER...A BROAD TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO PERSIST
OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL STEER THE HURRICANE ON A MORE
NORTHERLY TRACK.   THIS IS THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF THE
TRACK AND LONG RANGE GLOBAL MODELS.

A NOAA GULFSTREAM PLANE WILL SAMPLE THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE HURRICANE
TONIGHT AND AN AIR FORCE PLANE WILL PENETRATE THE EYE EARLY
THURSDAY.

THE SATELLITE PRESENTATION OF GERT IS NOT QUITE AS IMPRESSIVE THIS
EVENING AS IT WAS THIS AFTERNOON.  SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES AT
00Z WERE 127 AND 140 KT FROM TAFB AND SAB...BUT A RECENT 3 HR
AVERAGE OF THE RAW OBJECTIVE DVORAK NUMBERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN ALGORITHM WAS ABOUT 115 KT.  FOR CONTINUITY...THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY IS HELD AT 130 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.  THE TRUTH WILL BE
REVEALED LATER THIS MORNING WHEN A RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WILL BE
IN THE CYCLONE.  THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL INDICATES SLIGHT
WEAKENING OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS...BUT GERT IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN
A VERY POWERFUL HURRICANE. 

INITIAL MOTION IS 275/9...A BIT SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 
DROPSONDE DATA FROM THE NOAA GULFSTREAM JET NICELY SHOW THE MID-
LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE.  THE DATA ALSO SHOW
A BREAK IN THE RIDGE ALONG 60W...AND MOST OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES
A TURN TO THE NORTHWEST BY THIS LONGITUDE.  THE 18Z AVIATION HAS A
HORRIBLE INITIALIZATION OF THE VORTEX REGION...WITH SOUTHEAST WINDS
A FEW HUNDRED MILES AHEAD OF THE HURRICANE AT 500 MB THAT ARE 40-50
KT IN ERROR.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE
UKMET WHICH HAS PERFORMED WELL WITH THIS SYSTEM.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT THU SEP 16 1999
 
AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER HAS JUST REACHED GERT
REPORTING A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 941 MB AND 119 KT FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS
IN THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT. AN EYEWALL DROPSONDE REPORTED 141 KT
ABOVE THE SURFACE. BASED ON THIS...AND A SLIGHTLY DEGRADED SATELLITE
SIGNATURE...THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE DECREASED TO 125 KT. THE AIRCRAFT
ALSO REPORTED CONCENTRIC EYEWALLS WITH DIAMETERS OF 18 AND 30 NM.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 285/9...A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY. ALL MODEL GUIDANCE IS INDICATING A TURN TO THE
NORTH OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. WHILE THE UNANIMITY IS HARD TO
DISAGREE WITH...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS NORTHERLY FLOW ABOUT 400
NM NORTH OF GERT. THIS SUGGESTS THE TURN MAY BE SLOWER THAN THE
MODELS INDICATE. THE FORECAST TACK GOES ALONG WITH THE TURN AND IS
SHIFTED NORTH FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...BUT IS ALONG THE SOUTHERN
EDGE OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE.
 
GERT CONTINUES TO HAVE IMPRESSIVE CONVECTION AND GOOD OUTFLOW. THE
SHIPS MODEL WEAKENS GERT THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO
INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR. A LOOK AT THE 200 MB WIND FIELDS IN THE
AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS DOES NOT OBVIOUSLY SHOW SUCH SHEAR. IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT CONCENTRIC EYEWALL CYCLES MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT IN
INTENSITY CHANGES THAN SHEAR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A
SLIGHT WEAKENING SIMILAR TO THE LAST FORECAST IN CASE SOME INCREASE
IN SHEAR DOES OCCUR. HOWEVER...THIS IS A LOW CONFIDENCE FORECAST...
AND THE MAXIMUM WINDS MAY VERY WELL OSCILLATE IN THE 115-130 KT
RANGE DURING THE PERIOD.

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT GERT CONTINUES TO BE WELL ORGANIZED
WITH A DISTINCT EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST. THERE
ARE BANDING FEATURES AND AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW.  HOWEVER...GERT IS
NOT AS STRONG AS IT WAS 24 HOURS AGO...AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE
DVORAK T-NUMBERS.  THESE FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY WERE EXPECTED AND
ARE FORECAST TO CONTINUE.  

GERT HAS BEEN MOVING BETWEEN WEST AND WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK WHILE
LOCATED SOUTH OF A STRONG SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  HOWEVER...MODELS
UNANIMOUSLY INDICATE THAT GERT SHOULD TURN TOWARD THE NORTHWEST
LATER TODAY OR FRIDAY AS WESTERN PORTION OF THE RIDGE WEAKENS. THE
FORECAST IS PRACTICALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MODEL ENSEMBLE.  ON
THIS TRACK...GERT SHOULD MOVE WELL NORTH OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS AND
OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC.  AT THIS TIME...ONLY BERMUDA APPEARS TO BE
NEAR THE PATH OF GERT.   

ANOTHER AIR FORCE PLANE WILL CHECK GERT LATER TODAY.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECONNAISSANCE DATA SINCE ABOUT 20Z.  AT THAT
TIME PEAK FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS WERE 127 KT...THIS SUPPORTS A SURFACE
WIND OF 115 KT.  DROPSONDES IN THE NORTHEAST AND NORTHWEST QUADRANTS
OF THE EYEWALL REPORTED SURFACE WINDS OF ABOUT 85 AND 110 KT
RESPECTIVELY.  SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 127
AND 115 KT.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 115 KT FOR THIS
PACKAGE...AND ANOTHER AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN THE CYCLONE AT 06Z.  THERE
IS NO SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL RUN FOR THIS CYCLE...BUT THE SPREAD OF
THE BAM MODELS SUGGESTS LOW SHEAR OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  WATER
TEMPERATURES REMAIN WARM SO THE CURRENT INTENSITY IS MAINTAINED
THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD...ALTHOUGH FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY
ASSOCIATED WITH INNER CORE/EYEWALL DYNAMICS ARE TO BE EXPECTED. 
WIND RADII HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY ADJUSTED BASED ON THE LATEST
RECON DATA.

THE INTIAL MOTION REMAINS 300/9.  THERE HAS BEEN A NOTICEABLE SHIFT
IN THE GUIDANCE...WITH ALL MODELS DEPENDENT ON THE AVN SHOWING A
LEFTWARD TURN AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  ONCE AGAIN...THE AVN IS
HAVING SEVERE PROBLEMS INITIALIZING THE VORTEX...AND THIS APPEARS TO
LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MID-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE SOUTHWEST OF
THE CYCLONE.  THE NOGAPS AND THE UKMET TRACKS DO NOT HAVE THE LEFT
TURN.  THERE ARE TWO GFDL RUNS...ONE RUN OFF THE NOGAPS...GFNI...AND
ONE OFF THE AVN...GFDI.  ONLY THE GFDI SHOWS THE TURN.  I AM NOT
READY TO BITE ON THIS GUIDANCE AND MAINTAIN A SLOWLY RECURVING TRACK
THAT IS HALFWAY BETWEEN THE UKMET AND GFNI.  ON THIS TRACK BERMUDA
IS A POTENTIAL TARGET IN ABOUT 4 DAYS.

THE MAXIMUM WINDS IN THE PUBLIC ADVISORY ARE SET TO 135 MPH FOR
CONSISTENCY IN THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE.

THE LATEST AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER FLIGHT REPORTED 149 KT
WINDS AT 868 MB AND 123 KT WINDS AT THE SURFACE ON AN EYEWALL
DROPSONDE. THE MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE WAS 942 MB. SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE 127 KT...115
KT...AND 115 KT RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT DATA...THE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE RAISED TO 120 KT. THIS INCREASE IS MOST
LIKELY A MINOR FLUCTUATION AND NOT THE START OF INTENSIFICATION.

GERT IS A LITTLE WEST OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...AND THE
INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 295/09. OTHER THAN THIS... THERE
IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY. GERT IS EXPECTED TO
GRADUALLY TURN NORTHWEST AND NORTH-NORTHWEST TOWARD A BREAK IN THE
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE NEAR BERMUDA. AS SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...
THE AVIATION MODEL BASED GUIDANCE BENDS THE STORM A LITTLE TO THE
LEFT BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IGNORES THIS AND MORE FOLLOWS THE GFDN AND UKMET...WITH A BEND TO
THE RIGHT. THE TRACK IS SHIFTED SOMEWHAT TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS
TRACK DUE TO THE CURRENT POSITION AND INITIAL MOTION. 

GERT CONTINUES TO HAVE CONVECTIVE TOPS TO -70C SURROUNDING THE
CENTER AND GOOD OUTFLOW IN ALL BUT THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT. INTENSITY
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN THE SYSTEM...BUT SATELLITE IMAGERY
INDICATES NO OBVIOUS REASON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THE UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH NORTHWEST OF GERT MAY CAUSE SOME INCREASED VERTICAL SHEAR BY
72 HOURS...BUT IT IS MORE LIKELY CONCENTRIC EYEWALL CYCLES WILL BE
THE DOMINATING INFLUENCE ON THE INTENSITY DURING THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THE INTENSITY FORECAST REFLECTS THIS...MAINTAINING 115-120
KT WINDS THROUGH 72 HOURS.

MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT GERT COULD COME UNCOMFORTABLY
CLOSE TO BERMUDA AFTER THIS FORECAST PERIOD. THEREFORE...INTERESTS
IN BERMUDA SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE HURRICANE OVER THE
WEEKEND.

THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT
DATA AND PERIPHERAL SHIP REPORTS.

SURFACE FRONTAL TROUGH...ASSOCIATED WITH EX-HURRICANE FLOYD...  
NORTHWEST OF GERT...AND AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE JUST EAST OF THE

WEST...LIKELY DUE TO THE NORTHEAST-SOUTHWEST ORIENTED UPPER TROUGH
SITUATED ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO THE WEST OF GERT. HOWEVER...THE AVN AND
NOGAPS SUGGEST THE TROUGH WILL WEAKEN AND AN ANTICYCLONE BUILD OVER
THE HURRICANE. THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS

GERT REMAINS A HEALTHY HURRICANE WITH A 25 NM DIAMETER EYE
SURROUNDED BY VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS. WHILE THE CONVECTION HAS ERODED
A LITTLE IN THE NORTH QUADRANT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS....DVORAK
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN AT 127 KT AND 115 KT
RESPECTIVELY.  OBJECTIVE-BASED ESTIMATES ARE RUNNING IN THE SAME
RANGE.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 115 KT FOR THIS
ADVISORY...AND SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE LIKELY DURING THE
NEXT 24 HRS. SOME GRADUAL WEAKENING OF GERT IS FORECAST LATER IN THE
PERIOD DUE TO INCREASING SHEAR AND SLIGHTLY COOLER WATER. HOWEVER...
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT A JET STREAM APPROACHING FROM THE
NORTHWEST MAY ACT AS AN OUTFLOW MECHANISM RATHER THAN A SHEARING
MECHANISM. IF THAT OCCURS...GERT MAY NOT WEAKEN AT ALL AND MIGHT
STRENGTHEN.
 
THE 12 HOUR MOTION IS 330/8...WHILE A SHORTER TERM MOTION IS CLOSER
TO 315/6. A COMPROMISE INITIAL MOTION OF 325/7 IS USED FOR THIS
PACKAGE. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW LOCATED SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY NEAR

GERT DOES NOT LOOK QUITE AS IMPRESSIVE AS IT DID EARLIER.  THE
AMOUNT OF COLD CLOUD TOPS IN THE CDO HAS DECREASED AND THE EYE IS
NOT THAT WELL-DEFINED.  UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW IS RESTRICTED TO
THE SOUTHWEST.  NONETHELESS...IT IS A FORMIDABLE HURRICANE WITH A 30
N MI DIAMETER EYE AND A CLOSED WALL AS SUGGESTED BY MICROWAVE
IMAGERY DATA.  THE STATISTICAL INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME SHOWS
GERT MAINTAINING MAJOR HURRICANE STRENGTH FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS...AS
DOES THE NHC INTENSITY FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION...320/7...IS ABOUT THE SAME AS IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  GERT HAS TRACKED A BIT TO THE LEFT OF YESTERDAYS MOTION. 
THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF MORE DEEP-LAYER RIDGING TO
THE NORTH OF THE HURRICANE AND STEERING AROUND A WEAK MID/UPPER
LEVEL CYCLONE JUST NORTHEAST OF PUERTO RICO.  HOWEVER A LARGE 500 MB
TROUGH IS PREDICTED TO BE OVER THE U.S. EAST COAST IN A COUPLE OF
DAYS...AND THIS SHOULD WEAKEN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  AS A
CONSEQUENCE...GERT IS LIKELY TO TURN NORTHWARD GRADUALLY.  THE

ALTHOUGH ALL OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS KEEP THE CENTER OF THE
HURRICANE EAST OF BERMUDA...SEVERAL FACTORS DICTATE THE ISSUANCE OF
A HURRICANE WATCH AND TROPICAL STORM WARNING FOR THE ISLANDS AT THIS
TIME.  THESE INCLUDE: (A) UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FORECAST...(B) THE
SIZE AND STRENGTH OF GERT...(C) AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED...AND
(D) AVOIDING THE ISSUANCE OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS LATE AT NIGHT.

MOTION IS ALONG THE SAME HEADING WITH SOME INCREASE IN SPEED...
320/10.  THE TRACK FORECAST REASONING IS ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE. 
GERT IS CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE.  DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO...A LARGE 500 MB TROUGH NEAR 
THE EASTERN U.S. COAST IS EXPECTED TO TURN THE HURRICANE MORE
NORTHWARD.  HOWEVER THE TURN COULD BE DELAYED AND GERT COULD
COME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO BERMUDA. 

MICROWAVE DATA INDICATE THAT GERT UNDERWENT AN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT
CYCLE EARLIER TODAY...AND THIS MAY HAVE EXPLAINED WHY IT APPEARED
WEAKER AT THAT TIME.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST REMAINS THE SAME AS
BEFORE...AND MAINTAINS MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

LATE IN THE PERIOD...GERT MAY WEAKEN A LITTLE MORE THAN SHOWN HERE

WITH MAX FLIGHT LEVEL WIND SPEED OF 98 KNOTS 71 NM SOUTHEAST OF THE
CENTER.  SATELLITE CURRENT INTENSITY NUMBERS REMAIN AT 90 KNOTS. 
SOME DEEP CONVECTION HAS OCCURRED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE SYSTEM
AND WILL PROBABLY DELAY THE WEAKENING PROCESS.  THEREFORE..THE
CURRENT INTENSITY REMAINS AT 95 KNOTS AND THE FORECAST INTENSITIES
REMAIN THE SAME.  A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS FORECAST DURING THE NEXT
FEW DAYS AS THE HURRICANE ENCOUNTERS SHEAR AND COOLER SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 360/9...THE SYSTEM IS AT OR CLOSE TO ITS
RECURVATURE POINT.  THE LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT
IN DIRECTION OUT TO 48 HOURS WITH A FEW OF THEM BEING SLOWER THAN
THE REST.  A WIDER SCATTER OCCURS AT THE 72 HOUR POSITION.  THE

CENTER FIXES INDICATE THAT GERT IS ACQUIRING A SLIGHT EASTWARD
COMPONENT OF MOTION AND THAT THE FORWARD SPEED IS GRADUALLY
INCREASING.  GERT IS NEARING ITS CLOSEST POINT OF APPROACH TO
BERMUDA...AND WARNINGS THERE WILL LIKELY BE LOWERED LATER TODAY.

THE HURRICANE IS EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD ON THE
EASTERN SIDE OF A LARGE 500 MB TROUGH.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS MOSTLY AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO
THE U.K. MET. OFFICE GUIDANCE.  GERT SHOULD BE AT FAIRLY HIGH
LATITUDES IN THE LATTER PART OF THE PERIOD...AND LOSING TROPICAL

LATEST AIRCRAFT OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT THE EYEWALL IS WEAKENING.

UNCHANGED WITH THE 18Z AVIATION MODEL SHOWING GERT BEING STEERED BY
THE FLOW TO THE EAST OF A LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE

DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES INDICATE SLOW WEAKENING
CONTINUES.  COLD SSTS SHOULD BE ENCOUNTERED IN 24 HOURS OR SO AND
THIS SHOULD HASTEN THE WEAKENING PROCESS.  ALSO THE AVIATION MODEL
LOSES THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION AFTER 36 HOURS AS IT IS ABSORBED

SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES INCREASED CONVECTION NEAR AND EAST OF
THE CENTER OF THE BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA IN THE CENTRAL GULF OF
MEXICO. OBSERVATIONS FROM BUOYS 42001 AND 42003 SUGGEST A MINIMUM
CENTRAL PRESSURE AROUND 1005 MB...WITH 42003 REPORTING 30 KT WINDS
AT 0900Z. THUS...ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION
TEN.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 345/04. A STRONG DEEP LAYER TROUGH IS FORECAST
TO AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THIS...IN
THEORY...SHOULD TURN THE CYCLONE NORTHEAST OR EVEN EAST-NORTHEAST
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. OR FLORIDA. HOWEVER...MODEL GUIDANCE
HAS A GREAT VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS. THE UKMET TAKES THE CYCLONE ON THE
TRACK SUGGESTED BY THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN. ON THE OTHER HAND...THE AVN
LETS THE DEPRESSION LINGER IN THE GULF UNTIL THE ONCOMING COLD FRONT
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH CATCHES IT. THE AVN ALSO DEVELOPS A
SECONDARY LOW OFF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
GOES WITH THE SYNOPTICALLY SUGGESTED TRACK AND IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN A NORTHERLY UKMET AND A SOUTHERLY LBAR AND NHC98E. 

DEEP CONVECTION IS STILL POORLY ORGANIZED...WITH SATELLITE INTENSITY
ESTIMATES OF ONLY 25 KT. THE LARGE SCALE MODELS DEVELOP AN UPPER
LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE EASTERN GULF. HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SUGGESTS A WEAK TROUGH OR SHEAR AXIS IS EMBEDDED IN THE
ANTICYCLONE JUST WEST OF THE DEPRESSION...WHICH RESTRICTS OUTFLOW TO
THE WEST. THESE POINTS SUGGEST INTENSIFICATION SHOULD BE SLOW. LATER
INTENSIFICATION WILL DEPEND ON HOW THE DEPRESSION INTERACTS WITH THE
DEVELOPING TROUGH. BY 72 HOURS THE CYCLONE COULD SHEAR OFF...START
BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL...OR EVOLVE INTO A HYBRID OR SUBTROPICAL
CYCLONE. THE INTENSITY FORECAST WILL BRING THE SYSTEM TO 50 KT IN 48
HOURS AND KEEP THAT INTENSITY AT 72 HOURS. THIS IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN POSSIBLE WEAKENING DUE TO SHEAR AND POSSIBLE DEEPENING DUE
TO BAROCLINIC INTERACTION.

WHILE NO WATCHES OR WARNINGS WILL BE ISSUED WITH THIS PACKAGE...THEY
MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY. RESIDENTS OF THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THE EXPOSED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION TO
THE NORTHWEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION.  AIR FORCE RECONNAISSANCE HAS
CONFIRMED THE LOCATION OF THE CENTER AND AN EXTRAPOLATED SURFACE
PRESSURE OF 1002 MB.  BASED ON THE EARLIER SHIP OB OF 1004 THE
CENTRAL PRESSURE WILL BE 1003 MB. THE LATEST INITIAL POSITION
INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT MOVING AS FAST AS EARLIER
CALCULATED AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 360/03.  MODEL GUIDANCE IS
NOW MORE IN LINE WITH THE SYNOPTIC REASONING WHICH IS.. A TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS.
THIS SHOULD TURN THE CYCLONE NORTHEAST OR EAST-NORTHEAST ACROSS THE
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. OR FLORIDA.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK IS FOR A GRADUAL
TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE.
 
SINCE THE DEEP CONVECTION REMAINS WELL TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE
LLCC THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO SLOWLY DEVELOP.  RECON SHOWS MAXIMUM
WINDS OF ABOUT 15 KTS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CENTER AND WILL
PROBABLY PICK UP 25 TO 30 KTS ON THE SOUTH AND EAST SIDE SIMILAR TO
THE SURFACE OBS AND LOW LEVEL CLOUD DRIFT WINDS.  AT THIS TIME THE
SYSTEM WILL REMAIN A DEPRESSION.
 
UNTIL THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION GETS BETTER ORGANIZED THE STORM
WATCHES MAY BE NOT BE REQUIRED UNTIL TOMORROW.  HOWEVER...RESIDENTS
OF THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN GULF COAST SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS
OF THIS SYSTEM.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT MON SEP 20 1999
 
INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE LOW LEVEL CENTER OF
HARVEY IS LOCATED NORTHWEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION...ALTHOUGH THE
CENTER ITSELF IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO FIND. THE 08Z OBSERVATION FROM
BUOY 42003 INDICATES 31 KT WINDS AND A 1002.7 MB PRESSURE...WHICH
WOULD IMPLY A CENTRAL PRESSURE AROUND 1001 OR 1000 MB. CONVECTIVE
ORGANIZATION HAS NOT IMPROVED DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS...SO THE
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS REMAIN 40 KT.

BASED ON LIMITED SATELLITE IMAGERY BEFORE AND AFTER THE ECLIPSE...
THE INITIAL MOTION FOR THIS PACKAGE IS 065/02. HOWEVER...THE BUOY
OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THE MOTION MIGHT BE A LITTLE FASTER. THERE IS
LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE...WITH HARVEY EXPECTED TO MOVE EAST-NORTHEAST AHEAD OF THE
DEVELOPING EASTERN U.S. DEEP LAYER TROUGH. MOST MODELS AGREE WITH
THIS...ALTHOUGH SOME HAVE A MORE EASTWARD MOTION TOWARD THE FLORIDA
WEST COAST FOLLOWED BY AN EAST-NORTHEAST MOTION. THE FORECAST TRACK
IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...WITH A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO THE
SOUTH DURING THE FIRST 48 HOURS. THE ONE REAL MODEL OUTLIER IS THE
NOGAPS...WHICH MOVES HARVEY SOUTHEAST INTO THE CARIBBEAN.

ALTHOUGH THE CONVECTION IS STILL POORLY ORGANIZED...SOME DEVELOPMENT
HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. WHILE STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR IS
PRESENT OVER THE NORTHERN GULF COAST...HARVEY IS LIKELY TO REMAIN IN
A SOMEWHAT FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO. THE
SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION WILL BE DETERMINED BY HOW THE STORM INTERACTS
WITH THE TROUGH. THE INTENSITY FORECAST BRINGS THE STORM TO 50 KT IN
24 HOURS...THEN CALLS FOR SLOW WEAKENING DUE TO INCREASED SHEARING
AND BAROCLINIC INTERACTION. HARVEY IS FORECAST TO BECOME
EXTRATROPICAL BY 72 HOURS.
 
BECAUSE OF THE FORECAST TRACK A TROPICAL STORM WATCH REMAINS IN
EFFECT ON THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA. IF HARVEY IS MOVING FASTER...
WARNINGS MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY. RESIDENTS OF THE NORTHERN
AND EASTERN GULF COAST SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
THIS SYSTEM.

RECON OBSERVATIONS THIS MORNING SHOW A SLIGHT PRESSURE FALL...TO 998

REMAINS RATHER DISORGANIZED-LOOKING WITH THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER NEAR
THE NORTHWEST EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION AND LIMITED UPPER-LEVEL
OUTFLOW.  HOWEVER THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF STRENGTHENING...AND IN
FACT THE LATEST GFDL MODEL RUN MAKES HARVEY A HURRICANE BEFORE
LANDFALL ON THE FLORIDA WEST COAST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS MORE
CONSERVATIVE AND BRINGS THE SYSTEM CLOSE TO HURRICANE STRENGTH.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO A LACK OF GOOD CENTER FIXES. THE
STORM APPEARS TO BE MOVING FASTER THAN EARLIER TODAY... BUT PROBABLY
NOT QUITE AS FAST AS THE ESTIMATE SHOWN IN THE 12Z INTERMEDIATE
ADVISORY.  MY BEST GUESS AT THIS TIME IS 065/06.  HARVEY IS EXPECTED
TO GRADUALLY ACCELERATE AS IT IS STEERED BY THE WESTERLY FLOW ON THE
SOUTH SIDE OF A LARGE MID-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES.  THE
CURRENT NHC FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE AND
TAKES THE CENTER NEAR THE COAST IN 24 HOURS.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM REMAINS DISORGANIZED WITH THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER LOCATED TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE MAIN AREA OF DEEP
CONVECTION.  THE STORM IS PROBABLY ALSO ENTRAINING SOME DRIER AIR
FROM THE NORTHWEST AS WELL.  THE GFDL MODEL CONTINUES TO INDICATE
THAT SOME STRENGTHENING WILL OCCUR BUT OTHER GUIDANCE...SUCH AS THE
NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...SUGGESTS WEAKENING.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
INDICATES ONLY A SLIGHT ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN STRENGTH.

ACCORDING TO RECONNAISSANCE AND SATELLITE FIXES...THE MOVEMENT HAS
BEEN A BIT ERRATIC OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS AND INITIAL MOTION IS
REDUCED TO 075/5.  HOWEVER...BASED ON THE STEERING CURRENT IMPLIED
BY THE LARGER-SCALE FLOW...ACCELERATION TOWARD THE EAST AND
NORTHEAST IS FORECAST...SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.  

SHIP REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE EXTENT OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS
IS LARGER THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED...ABOUT 150 N MI OVER THE

RECONNAISSANCE FIXES FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT OVER THE LAST 6 HOURS INDICATE THAT HARVEY IS MOVING
080/9 KT...AND THIS IS THE INITIAL MOTION. THE LAST RECON FIX 
ALONG WITH CURRENT RADAR TRENDS SUGGESTS THAT HARVEY MAYBE MOVING
SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF EAST.  THE APPROACHING MID LATITUDE TROUGH IS
EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE THE SYSTEM ON A MORE NORTHEASTERLY TRACK 
WITHIN THE NEXT 24.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS A GENERAL
EASTWARD MOTION THROUGH 12 HRS WITH A NORTHEAST TURN THEREAFTER  
WITH INCREASING SPEED.  THIS TRACK IS SLIGHTLY SOUTH AND FASTER
THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFDL
AND THE UKMET.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM REMAINS DISORGANIZED WITH THE
LOW-LEVEL CENTER LOCATED ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE CLOUD SHIELD.
THE STORM IS PROBABLY ALSO ENTRAINING SOME DRIER AIR FROM THE
NORTHWEST AS WELL.  DATA FROM THE DOPPLER RADAR IN TAMPA SUGGESTS
THAT MID-LEVEL CENTER IS DECOUPLED FROM THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INDICATES ONLY A SLIGHT ADDITIONAL INCREASE 
IN STRENGTH...WITH EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION EXPECTED BY 48 HRS...
ALTHOUGH THIS MAY OCCUR SOONER.  
 
THE WIND RADII HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON A SHIP REPORT AND WIND
ANALYSES FROM THE HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION.

A TROPICAL STORM WARNING IS NOW IN EFFECT FOR THE FLORIDA EAST COAST
FROM SOUTH OF FLAGLER BEACH TO BOCA RATON.  THE TROPICAL STORM WATCH

THE SOUTHEAST.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 130/9.  HARVEY IS NOT WELL
ORGANIZED...WITH MOST OF THE HEAVY RAIN AND STRONG WINDS TO THE

MOST GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT HARVEY WILL TURN TO THE EAST THEN
NORTHEAST AND RAPIDLY ACCELERATE IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING MID
LATITUDE TROUGH.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED SOUTH OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED ON THE CURRENT MOTION...AND HAS SOMEWHAT
LESS ACCELERATION AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD DUE TO THE MORE

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER INVESTIGATING THE BROAD LOW
PRESSURE OVER THE BAY OF CAMPECHE FOUND A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 1003
MB AND MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 44 KT SOUTH OF THE CENTER.
SINCE THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED 15 KT WINDS OVER MUCH OF THE REMAINDER
OF THE CIRCULATION...IT IS POSSIBLE THE 44 KT IS DUE TO FUNNELING
ALONG THE COAST OR DOWNBURSTS. HOWEVER...THE SYSTEM IS BETTER
ORGANIZED IN BOTH WINDS AND CONVECTION THAN 24 HOURS AGO...AND
ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION ELEVEN.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS VERY UNCERTAIN. IF THIS IS THE SAME CENTER
SEEN 24 HR AGO...THE MOTION IS 225/04. SINCE THAT IS NOT CERTAIN...
THE INITIAL MOTION IS SET TO STATIONARY. LITTLE MOTION IS LIKELY FOR
THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS AS A DEEP LAYER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN
GULF OF MEXICO MOVES EASTWARD AND WEAKENS. AFTER THAT TIME...ENOUGH
RIDGING SHOULD DEVELOP NORTH OF THE CYCLONE TO ALLOW A
WEST-NORTHWEST DRIFT. THIS SCENARIO IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE
LARGE SCALE MODELS.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR LITTLE CHANGE IN STRENGTH DUE TO
PROXIMITY TO LAND AND MOST OF THE INFLOW BYPASSING THE DEPRESSION
FOR THE NORTHERN GULF SURFACE TROUGH. HOWEVER...UPPER LEVEL
CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING IF THE CENTER DRIFTS
FURTHER AWAY FROM THE COAST.

THE DEPRESSION HAS NOT CHANGED VERY MUCH IN STRUCTURE.  ALTHOUGH THE
LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION IS A LITTLE BETTER ORGANIZED AND THE PRESSURE
IS 1002 MB...THE CONVECTION IS LOCATED TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE
CENTER...DUE TO NORTHEASTERLY SHEAR.  IN ADDITION...A PORTION OF THE
LOW-LEVEL FLOW IS HEADING TOWARD A LOW PRESSURE TROUGH OVER THE
NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO INSTEAD OF TOWARD THE DEPRESSION.  WE ARE
KEEPING THE SYSTEM AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION THROUGH 72 HOURS BUT
ONLY A 5-KNOT INCREASE IN THE WINDS...WILL BRING IT TO STORM STATUS.
SHIPS MODEL MAKES IT A HURRICANE IN 60 HOURS BUT IT SEEMS
UNREALISTIC UNLESS THE DEPRESSION MOVES AWAY FROM LAND.

THE DEPRESSION HAS BEEN MEANDERING DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS AND
STEERING CURRENTS ARE FORECAST TO REMAIN WEAK.  THEREFORE...ONLY A
SMALL WEST OR WEST-NORTHWEST DRIFT IS INDICATED.  THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH GLOBAL MODELS WHICH UNANIMOUSLY SUGGEST VERY SLOW MOTION...
KEEPING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE IN THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO FOR
SEVERAL DAYS.

INFRARED IMAGERY SHOWS A  POORLY ORGANIZED CONVECTIVE PATTERN AND
LITTLE EVIDENCE OF A LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION OVER THE BAY OF
CAMPECHE.  ON A LARGER SCALE...THE DEPRESSION APPEARS TO BE LOCATED
AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF A FRONTAL ZONE EXTENDING FROM MEXICO TO THE

MORNING VISIBLE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT TROPICAL DEPRESSION ELEVEN
REMAINS POORLY ORGANIZED...WITH CLUSTERS OF CONVECTION MAINLY TO THE
WEST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER. THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 30 KT
BASED ON SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS STATIONARY. THE CYCLONE REMAINS A BROAD
CIRCULATION AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF A TROUGH LYING NORTHEAST-
SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO...AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING OVER TEXAS AND
NORTHERN MEXICO. THIS COMBINATION SHOULD PRODUCE A SLOW MOTION FOR
AT LEAST THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS. AFTER THAT...THE RIDGE SHOULD
SHIFT EAST AS A TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE CENTRAL U.S....WHICH MAY
ALLOW A SLIGHTLY FASTER NORTHWARD MOTION. LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE
AGREES WITH THIS SCENARIO...ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS ON HOW
FAST THE RIDGE WILL MOVE. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING...AS AN
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO REMAIN THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD. THE MAIN INHIBITING FACTORS CURRENTLY ARE PROXIMITY
TO LAND AND MUCH OF THE WOULD BE INFLOW BYPASSING THE DEPRESSION FOR
THE GULF TROUGH. BY 48 HOURS THE TROUGH SHOULD WEAKEN AS ITS UPPER
SUPPORT MOVES INTO THE ATLANTIC...AND THE DEPRESSION SHOULD BE
SLIGHTLY FARTHER FROM THE COAST. BASED ON THESE EXPECTATIONS...SOME
MODEST STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AFTER 36 HOURS.

VISIBLE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT TROPICAL DEPRESSION ELEVEN REMAINS
POORLY ORGANIZED...WITH CLUSTERS OF CONVECTION MAINLY TO THE
WEST OF THE LOW LEVEL CENTER. AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
REPORTED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 1005 MB WITH MAXIMUM FLIGHT LEVEL
WINDS OF 33 KT IN THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT. THE INITIAL INTENSITY
REMAINS AT 30 KT.
 
THE RECON FIXES INDICATE A MOTION OF 310/3. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE
IN EITHER THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN OR THE FORECAST REASONING FROM THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE. GIVEN THE INITIAL MOTION...THE FORECAST TRACK HAS
BEEN ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST. WHILE IT IS SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...
THE 72 HOUR POSITION IS SLOWER THAN THAT INDICATED BY THE AVN AND
UKMET MODELS. THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS.
FIRST...SINCE RIDGING IS STILL DEVELOPING NORTH OF THE CYCLONE...THE
CURRENT NORTHWEST DRIFT MAY NOT PERSIST AND THE CYCLONE MAY STALL.
SECOND...THE RIDGE MAY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PUSH THE DEPRESSION INTO
THE MEXICAN COAST BEFORE IT CAN TURN NORTH.
 
UPPER LEVEL WINDS REMAIN FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING...AS AN
ANTICYCLONE WILL LIKELY EXIST OVER THE SYSTEM THROUGH THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THE MAIN INHIBITING FACTORS REMAIN ARE PROXIMITY TO LAND AND

THE DEPRESSION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY ON IR IMAGES.
HOWEVER...DATA FROM THE LATEST RECON EARLIER TONIGHT INDICATED THE
EXISTENCE OF A LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION AND A 1004 MB MINIMUM PRESSURE.
INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 30 KNOTS...AND I AM BEING GENEROUS.  
IT IS HARD TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING WITH THE PREVAILING PATTERN BUT
SHIPS AND SHIFOR SUGGEST INTENSIFICATION.  THIS COULD HAPPEN ONLY IF
THE DEPRESSION SURVIVES DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS AND MOVES
AWAY FROM LAND.  BY THEN...GLOBAL MODELS DEVELOP AN UPPER-LEVEL
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM.  SINCE SHIPS IS THE ONLY RELIABLE GAME
IN TOWN...SMALL STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED BEYOND 48 HOURS. 

THE FORECAST TRACK IS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE MODELS ARE
DIVERGENT.  BOTH THE AVN AND UK GLOBAL MODELS BRING THE DEPRESSION
ON A GENERAL NORTH-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWARD TRACK. THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE EASTWARD SHIFT OF THE 500 MB HIGH CURRENTLY NORTH OF THE
DEPRESSION.  THEREFORE..THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR LITTLE
MOTION DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO AND THEN A SLOW NORTHWARD TRACK. 
I AM NOT SURE IF THE DEPRESSION WILL LAST THAT LONG.
 
TORRENTIAL RAINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPRESSION CONTINUES OVER
PORTIONS OF EASTERN MEXICO.

THE LATEST DATA RELAYED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE CENTER IS SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF THE LAST FEW
FIXES BUT ESSENTIALLY HAS BEEN MEANDERING THE LAST 6 HOURS OR SO.
IN FACT THE LAST MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM THE AIRCRAFT STATED THAT THEY
WERE HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING A CLOSED CIRCULATION CENTER. THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE FOR THIS PACKAGE IS STATIONARY. 

THE FORECAST TRACK GUIDANCE REMAINS QUITE SCATTERED WITH THE GFDN
AND NOGAPS MEANDERING THE DEPRESSION.  MEANWHILE...THE AVN DRIFTS 
IT NORTHWARD. THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS
UNCHANGED WITH THE EXPECTED EASTWARD SHIFT OF THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC 
RIDGE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION ALLOWING A MORE NORTH-NORTHWEST TO
NORTH MOTION BEYOND 36 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS AN UPDATE 
OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY WHICH CALLS FOR LITTLE MOTION DURING THE
NEXT DAY OR SO FOLLOWED BY A SLOW GENERAL NORTHWARD TRACK.  HOWEVER
...THE SYSTEM MAY NOT LAST THAT LONG.
 
AS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR MOST OF ITS EXISTENCE...THE DEPRESSION IS
VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY IN SATELLITE IMAGERY WITH A CHAOTIC
CONVECTIVE PATTERN UNCHARACTERISTIC OF A DEVELOPING TROPICAL
CYCLONE. THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 30 KNOTS.  THE
RECONNAISSANCE REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 1007 MB...
UP 3 MB FROM LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.  AS MENTIONED IN THE LAST
ADVISORY...ITS HARD TO FORECAST STRENGTHENING GIVEN THE CURRENT
CLOUD PATTERN AND THE SYSTEMS PROXIMITY TO LAND. THE 00Z NCEP GLOBAL
MODEL DEVELOPS AN UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF
MEXICO BETWEEN 24 AND 48 HRS. THUS...FURTHER INTENSIFICATION WILL
ONLY OCCUR IF THE DEPRESSION SURVIVES THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS AND
MOVES AWAY FROM LAND.  

VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS...TO -80C...PERSIST ALONG THE EASTERN PORTION
OF MEXICO BETWEEN TAMPICO AND VERACRUZ.  THE PRIMARY THREAT THIS
SYSTEM POSES IS ONE OF HEAVY RAINS...AND THE COLLATERAL THREAT OF
FLASH FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES ESPECIALLY IN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN.

DATA FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER RELAYED AFTER THE
LAST ADVISORY SUGGESTS THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION ELEVEN HAS
RE-FORMED CONSIDERABLY TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE EARLIER FIXES. THE
CENTER IS POORLY DEFINED IN VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...SO IT IS NOT
CLEAR WHETHER THE CENTER IS STILL NEAR THE LOCATION SUGGESTED BY THE
AIRCRAFT. THE INITIAL POSITION IS A RE-LOCATION FROM THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY...AND MORE RE-LOCATION MAY BE NECESSARY THIS AFTERNOON WHEN
THE NEXT AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATES THE CYCLONE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ASSUMED TO BE 315/4...WHICH IS THE 24 HOUR
MOTION. THE DEPRESSION IS AT THE WESTERN END OF A WEAKENING FRONTAL
TROUGH EXTENDING ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA AND THE GULF OF MEXICO...
AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE MID/UPPER ANTICYCLONE MOVING
EASTWARD ACROSS TEXAS...LOUISIANA...AND THE NORTHWEST GULF. THE
LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE INDICATES THE ANTICYCLONE SHOULD CONTINUE
EASTWARD...ALLOWING THE CYCLONE TO TURN NORTH AFTER 36 TO 48 HOURS.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS THIS AND IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS PACKAGE AFTER THE RE-LOCATION IS ACCOUNTED FOR. AN
ALTERNATE SCENARIO IS THAT THE RIDGE MAY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DRIVE
THE SYSTEM INTO THE MEXICAN COAST BEFORE ANY TURN CAN OCCUR. THE
POSSIBILITY OF THIS INCREASES IF THE CENTER IS FARTHER WEST THAN
CURRENTLY THOUGHT.

WHILE THE ASSOCIATED CONVECTION IS DISORGANIZED...THE CLOUD TOPS ARE
TO -80C AND THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS APPEAR GENERALLY FAVORABLE. IF THE
CYCLONE STAYS OFFSHORE...AND IF IT CAN BETTER SEPARATE ITSELF FROM
THE GULF SURFACE TROUGH...IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTENSIFY. SOME
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST AFTER 36 HR ON THE PREMISE THAT BOTH OF
THOSE IFS WILL OCCUR.

THE STRONGEST CONVECTION REMAINS WEST OF THE CENTER...OVER EASTERN
MEXICO BETWEEN VERACRUZ AND TAMPICO. HEAVY RAINS SHOULD PERSIST OVER
PORTIONS OF EASTERN MEXICO UNTIL THE DEPRESSION EITHER MOVES AWAY OR
DISSIPATES.

THE AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER INVESTIGATING THE SYSTEM COULD NOT
FIND A CENTER. INSTEAD THERE APPEAR TO BE SMALL VORTICITY MAXIMA
ALONG A BROAD TROUGH WITH A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 1008 MB. BASED ON
THIS...THE DEPRESSION WILL BE DECLARED DISSIPATED.

DESPITE THE LACK OF A CENTER...WINDS HAVE INCREASED CONSIDERABLY

THE SYSTEM IS STILL GENERATING CONVECTION...AND HEAVY FLOOD-
PRODUCING RAINS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE OVER PORTIONS OF EASTERN

THE LATEST SSM/I PASS FROM THE DMSP SATELLITE SUPPLIED BY THE NAVAL
RESEARCH LABORATORY IN MONTEREY CALIFORNIA SHOWS SUGGESTS THAT THE
CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE IS A BIT FURTHER NORTH THAN
EARLIER ESTIMATES...MULTICHANNEL GOES-8 IMAGERY ALSO SUPPORTS THIS.
AS ALWAYS...ONE MUST BE CAUTIOUS WHEN USING IR-BASED IMAGERY TO RE-
POSITION SYSTEM CENTERS AT NIGHT.  THE 06Z POSITION HAS BEEN NUDGED
NORTHWARD HOWEVER...WE WILL WAIT FOR VISIBLE IMAGERY BEFORE MAKING
FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS. IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IF THE CENTER NEEDS
TO BE ADJUSTED FURTHER NORTH ON THE NEXT PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 290/07 KNOTS. THE DEPRESSION IS ON
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WITH A TROUGH TO THE
NORTH AND WEST...PER WATER VAPOR IMAGERY.  THIS TROUGH MAY INDUCE
A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK IN THE SHORT TERM BUT THE GLOBAL MODELS
DEVELOP A RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING THE NEXT FEW
DAYS.   THIS MAY TURN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE BACK TO A MORE WEST-
NORTHWEST HEADING BY 72 HOURS.  THIS SCENARIO WOULD MINIMIZE THE
THREAT TO THE LESSER ANTILLES.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK 
IS ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND IS IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH BAMM AND A98E...ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY FASTER. 

THE CENTER OF DEPRESSION TWELVE IS ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION...WHICH IS RATHER LINEAR IN NATURE.  SATELLITE IMAGERY
AND CLOUD DRIFT WINDS FROM CIMSS/UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SHOW THAT
THE SYSTEM IS EXPERIENCING SOME SOUTHERLY SHEAR. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 30 KNOTS FOR THIS ADVISORY. THE
STATISTICAL HURRICANE INTENSITY PREDICTION SCHEME...SHIPS...SHOWS
A GRADUAL STRENGTHENING TREND SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST BRINGS THE SYSTEM TO TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH

CONVECTION. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 35
KT AND 30 KT RESPECTIVELY. WITH THE SOMEWHAT RAGGED APPEARANCE OF
THE CONVECTION...THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 30 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 280/6. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A
LOW LEVEL RIDGE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION...WITH WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATING A LARGE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NORTH OF 20N BETWEEN 40W-50W.
LARGE SCALE AND NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE RESPONDS TO THIS BY
INDICATING A WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HOURS.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST REFLECTS THIS...BUT IS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF
THE GUIDANCE IN RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT MOTION. THE FORECAST TRACK
IS IN BEST AGREEMENT WITH THE BAMS.

ALTHOUGH CIRRUS CLOUD MOTIONS INDICATE AN ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
CONVECTION...THE SYSTEM HAS A SHEARED APPEARANCE. IT MAY BE THAT
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW IS UNDERCUTTING THE ANTICYCLONE. THE AVN AND
NOGAPS INDICATE THAT A RIDGE OR ANTICYCLONE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/05.  THE NOGAPS...UKMET...GFDN...
AND AVIATION MODELS ALL SHOW A MID-TROPOSPHERIC LOW TO THE NORTH OF
THE DEPRESSION.  THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF KEEPING THE MOTION RATHER
SLOW AND WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWESTWARD FOR 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL
TRACK FORECAST IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BUT
STILL FASTER THAN THE ABOVE MENTIONED MODELS.
 
THE INITIAL WIND SPEED IS KEPT AT 30 KNOTS AS THERE DOES NOT APPEAR
TO BE MUCH GOING ON IN THE WAY OF ORGANIZATION OF THE CONVECTION.
THERE IS A SMALL AREA OF DEEP CONVECTION WELL EAST OF WHERE THE
POORLY DEFINED CENTER IS ESTIMATED TO BE LOCATED AND A HINT OF
BANDING TO THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST.  SSTS AND VERTICAL SHEAR ARE
FORECAST TO BE FAVORABLE FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS SO SOME SLOW
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST...BUT NOT TO HURRICANE FORCE AS INDICATED
BY THE SHIPS INTENSITY MODEL.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF TROPICAL
DEPRESSION TWELVE DURING THE LAST 6-12 HOURS.  THE CENTER REMAINS
EXPOSED AND WELL-REMOVED...ABOUT 100 NMI WEST...FROM THE DEEP
CONVECTION DUE TO MODEST...BUT PERSISTENT...SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL
WIND SHEAR.  DVORAK SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB
ARE 35 KT AND 30 KT...RESPECTIVELY.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE
HELD AT 30 KT.
 
THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS BEST IDENTIFIED IN GOES-8 MULTICHANNEL
SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 295/05.
THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN AND THE OBJECTIVE MODEL GUIDANCE REMAINS 
RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM THE LAST PACKAGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK SHOWS A SLOW...GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 72 HRS
...AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH CLIPER AND IS A LITTLE NORTH OF
THE UKMET OFFICE FORECAST TRACK. THIS TRACK REPRESENTS A SLIGHT
LEFTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BASED MAINLY ON THE
INITIAL MOTION.  IF THE SYSTEM REMAINS IN ITS CURRENT STATE BEYOND
24 HRS...THE TRACK MAY BE MORE WESTERLY...PER LOW-LEVEL STEERING.

WITH RESPECT TO THE INTENSITY FORECAST...THE DEPRESSION IS LESS
ORGANIZED THAN IT WAS 24 HRS AGO.  THE SHEAR INDUCED BY THE UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH...SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY NORTH OF 20N FROM 40W 
AND 50W...IS FORECAST BY THE GLOBAL MODELS TO DIMINISH AS THE TROUGH
WEAKENS AND LIFTS OUT. HOWEVER...THIS MAY NOT OCCUR AS QUICKLY AS
THE MODELS SUGGEST.  THE FORECAST CALLS FOR THE SYSTEM TO REMAIN A
DEPRESSION THROUGH 24 HRS WITH GRADUAL STRENGTHENING THEREAFTER...
BUT NOT AS AGGRESSIVE AS SHIPS...AS THE ENVIRONMENT BECOMES LESS
HOSTILE.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF TROPICAL
DEPRESSION TWELVE DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS.  THE CENTER REMAINS
EXPOSED WEST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION DUE TO PERSISTENT SHEAR.  DVORAK
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB REMAIN AT 35 KT AND
30 KT RESPECTIVELY. THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL REMAIN 30 KT.

VISIBLE IMAGERY SHOWS THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS A LITTLE FARTHER EAST
THAN INDICATED DURING THE NIGHT...SO THERE IS A SLIGHT RELOCATION OF
THE INITIAL POSITION. THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/3. WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY INDICATES A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL LOW CENTERED NEAR
26N45W...MOVING SLOWLY EAST. VISIBLE IMAGERY AND SHIP REPORTS
SUGGESTS THAT THE LOW HAS CREATED A WEAKNESS IN THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE
NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION...LEAVING IT IN VERY WEAK STEERING FLOW. THE
UKMET MODEL...WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE THE BEST HANDLE ON THE UPPER
LOW...INDICATES IT WILL BE 24 TO 36 HOURS BEFORE THE LOW WEAKENS AND
MOVES FAR ENOUGH TO THE EAST FOR ITS INFLUENCE ON THE DEPRESSION TO
DIMINISH. ACCORDINGLY...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK CONTINUES THE
SLOW WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION FOR 36 HOURS...WITH SOME INCREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED AFTER THAT.

CIRRUS CLOUD MOTIONS SHOW AN ANTICYCLONE OVER THE DEPRESSION.
HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CLEARLY SHOWS WEST-SOUTHWEST FLOW
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW UNDERCUTTING THE ANTICYCLONE AND
CAUSING SHEAR. THE UKMET...AVN...AND NOGAPS ALL INDICATE THE SHEAR
SHOULD DIMINISH AFTER 24 TO 36 HOURS...WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE
STRENGTHENING INDICATED IN THE INTENSITY FORECAST. GIVEN THE MODELS
TRACK RECORD ON FORECASTING THE SHEAR AFFECTING THIS SYSTEM... IT
WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING TO SEE IT PERSIST LONGER THAN THAT. IT IS
ALSO POSSIBLE THE DEPRESSION COULD WEAKEN BEFORE THE SHEAR CAN
DECREASE. HOWEVER...THE CIRCULATION IS 400-500 NM WIDE AND THEREFORE
IS UNLIKELY TO DISSIPATE WITH THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF SHEAR.

CONVECTION HAS DECREASED WITH TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE DURING THE
AFTERNOON...LEAVING AN EXPOSED LOW CLOUD SWIRL WITH WIDELY SCATTERED
CONVECTION WELL NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER. SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 30 KT...SO THAT IS THE
INITIAL INTENSITY.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 300/4. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN EITHER THE
SYNOPTIC PATTERN OR THE FORECAST REASONING FROM THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE. THE CYCLONE SHOULD CONTINUE SLOWLY WEST-NORTHWEST UNDER A
WEAKENED SUBTROPICAL RIDGE FOR 24 TO 36 HOURS...FOLLOWED BY A
GRADUAL INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS
LITTLE CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THAT WESTERLY FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE
UPPER LEVEL LOW/TROUGH NORTH OF THE CYCLONE CONTINUES TO SHEAR THE
DEPRESSION. THE AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS INDICATE THE TROUGH WILL
WEAKEN AND MOVE EASTWARD AFTER 12-24 HOURS. THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY
THE IMAGERY...WHICH SUGGESTS THE TROUGH IS STILL DIGGING SOUTH
TOWARD THE CYCLONE. THE INTENSITY FORECAST DELAYS INTENSIFICATION
EVEN MORE THAN PREVIOUSLY IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE SHEAR WILL NOT
DECREASE AS QUICKLY AS EARLIER FORECAST. EVEN THOUGH THE CYCLONE HAS
A LARGE CIRCULATION...THE ENVIRONMENT MAY STAY HOSTILE LONG ENOUGH
FOR IT TO WEAKEN OR DISSIPATE BEFORE THE SHEAR RELAXES.

11 PM EDT THU OCT 07 1999
 
THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION CONSISTS OF A LARGE CIRCULATION OF LOW
CLOUDS WITH A FEW PATCHES OF DEEP CONVECTION TO THE EAST AND WELL
REMOVED FROM THE CENTER.  THERE ARE NO SIGNS THAT THE SOUTHWESTERLY
SHEAR IS RELAXING...AND IN FACT...IT LOOKS STRONGER THAN EARLIER
TODAY.  STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW PREVAILS FROM THE EASTERN
CARIBBEAN TO A STRONG UPPER-LOW JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION.
IN ADDITION... THE OUTFLOW FROM THE FOLLOWING TROPICAL WAVE
APPRACHING FROM THE EAST WILL LIKELY AFFECT THE DEPRESSION BY
INCREASING THE SHEAR.  ON THE OTHER HAND...ALL AVAILABLE GLOBAL
MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE SHEAR IS GOING TO DECREASE...AS THE UPPER-
LOW MOVES NORTHEASTWARD WHILE SHIPS MODEL STRENGTHENS THE DEPRESSION
TO HURRICANE STATUS. I NORMALLY FOLLOW SHIPS AND GLOBAL MODELS...
WHICH HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD THIS SEASON. IN THIS CASE...HOWEVER...I DO
NOT SEE HOW SUCH A SHEARED DEPRESSION CAN RECOVER FROM THE
PREVAILING HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT.  AT THIS TIME...THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST KEEPS A 30-KNOT DEPRESSION THROUGH 72 HOURS BUT I WOULD NOT
BE SURPRISED...IF THIS DEPRESSION DISSIPATES IN 24 HOUR OR SO.
 
INITIAL MOTION IS 300/04. MODELS AND THE OFFCIAL FORECAST ARE IN
GOOD AGREEMENT IN MOVING THE DEPRESSION SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST-
NORTHWEST THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WEAK
STEERING FLOW WHICH IS FORECAST TO PREVAIL IN THE AREA.

THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE
REMAINS SPARSE...POORLY ORGANIZED AND WELL-REMOVED FROM THE CENTER.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 30 KT.
 
THE MULTICHANNEL GOES-8 IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER OF THE
DEPRESSION IS NOT VERY WELL-DEFINED. THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE
IS 300/3.  THE SYSTEM IS DRIFTING WEST-NORTHWEST AROUND THE WESTERN
PERIPHERY OF THE LOW-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
CONTINUES THIS GENERAL MOTION THROUGH 72 HRS WITH A GRADUAL INCREASE
IN FORWARD SPEED AFTER 36 HRS.  THIS FORECAST IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WITH BAMS...ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY SLOWER...AND IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
THE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO FEEL THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF WESTERLY/
SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONG 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH/LOW SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY NORTH OF THE
DEPRESSION.  THE SHEAR HAS BEEN PERSISTENT CONTRARY TO THE FORECASTS
BY THE GLOBAL MODELS. IN FACT...THE TROUGH HAS SHIFTED SOUTHWARD
OVER THE LAST 24 HRS.  BOTH THE AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS CONTINUE TO
INDICATE THAT THE TROUGH WILL WEAKEN AND SHIFT EASTWARD WITHIN 
24 HRS OR SO THEREBY LESSENING THE SHEAR. CURRENT SATELLITE TRENDS
SUGGEST THAT THIS MAY NOT OCCUR AS QUICKLY AS FORECAST. FURTHERMORE
...THE OUTFLOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPROACHING TROPICAL WAVE NEAR
33W/34W WILL LIKELY INCREASE THE SHEAR OVER THE CYCLONE. SO... UNTIL
THERE ARE SIGNS OF THE SHEAR ABATING...THE SYSTEM WILL BE MAINTAINED
AS A DEPRESSION THROUGH 72 HRS.
 
DESPITE THE LARGE NATURE OF THE CIRCULATION THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT
MAY PERSIST LONG ENOUGH THAT THE SYSTEM MAY NOT RECOVER AND COULD
WEAKEN OR DISSIPATE BEFORE THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...PERHAPS

TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE REMAINS AN EXPOSED LOW-LEVEL CLOUD
SWIRL...BUT WITH A FLARE-UP OF CONVECTION THIS MORNING...IT HAS
BOUGHT ITSELF AT LEAST ANOTHER 6-12 HOURS OF EXISTENCE.  THE
DEPRESSION REMAINS UNDER SOUTHWESTERLY VERTICAL WIND SHEAR
ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGE UPPER TROUGH TO ITS NORTH AND WEST. 
ALTHOUGH GLOBAL MODELS FORECAST THIS SHEAR TO LESSEN...WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE TROUGH IS STILL DIGGING SOUTHWARD AHEAD OF
THE DEPRESSION.  IN ADDITION...THE TROPICAL WAVE EAST OF THE
DEPRESSION HAS A HEALTHY OUTFLOW THAT MAY KEEP SHEAR VALUES HIGH. 
THESE FACTORS ARE EXPECTED TO LIMIT ANY SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING.

THE DEPRESSION HAS MOVED LITTLE THIS MORNING AND THE INITIAL MOTION
IS STATIONARY.  MOST MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS THE DEPRESSION MOVING
GENERALLY NORTHWESTWARD TOWARD A WEAKNESS IN THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ON THE LEFT EDGE OF THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE

SATELLITE IMAGES AND RAOB OBSERVATIONS FROM GRAND CAYMAN INDICATE
THAT THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN HAS BECOME

RECONNAISSANCE PLANE WILL PROVIDE BETTER INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION
AND THE INTENSITY OF IRENE LATER TODAY.  THE AREA OF SHOWERS AND
SQUALLS COVERS A LARGE AREA OF WESTERN CARIBBEAN AND THE OUTFLOW IS
EXCELLENT. CONVENTIONAL TOOLS INDICATE THAT IRENE COULD REACH
HURRICANE STATUS IN ABOUT 36 HOURS.  SHIPS AND GFDL MODELS ALSO
SUGGEST STRENGTHENING. 

INITIAL MOTION IS UNCERTAIN SINCE IRENE IS IN ITS FORMATIVE STAGE
BUT BEST ESTIMATE IS 345/7. IRENE SHOULD MOVE ON A GENERAL SLOW
NORTH NORTHWEST AND THEN NORTHWARD TRACK TROUGH 48 HOURS. 
THEREAFTER...AN UPPER TROUGH IS FORECAST TO APPROACH THE
NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND IRENE COULD TURN TOWARD THE NORTH-
NORTHEAST AND ACCELERATE. THIS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE GFDL AND UK

SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THE CLOUD PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH
IRENE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE WITH EXCELLENT OUTFLOW...PLENTY OF
DEEP CONVECTION AND BANDING FEATURES. T-NUMBER FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE
3.0 ON THE DVORAK SCALE.  HOWEVER...DATA FROM A RECONNAISSANCE PLANE
INDICATE THAT IRENE IS STILL POORLY ORGANIZED WITH TROPICAL STORM
FORCE WINDS...45 TO 50 KNOTS...LIMITED TO AN AREA WITHIN A BAND TO
THE NORTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  MINIMUM PRESSURE IS 1002 MB.  THE
ENVIRONMENT IS FORECAST TO BE FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING AND THERE
IS A WARM UPPER OCEANIC MIXED LAYER (FANCY FOR A WARM OCEAN) AHEAD
OF THE STORM.  THEREFORE...IRENE IS FORECAST TO BECOME A HURRICANE
IN 24 HOURS OR SO.

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 355/8.  IRENE SHOULD CONTINUE
ON THIS GENERAL TRACK...PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT SLOWER...DURING THE
NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE NORTH NORTHEAST
THEREAFTER.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE WEAKENING OF THE STEERING
FLOW AS THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH WEAKENS. THE NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD TURN
WILL RESULT FROM A NEW TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO MOVE EASTWARD

11 PM EDT WED OCT 13 1999

AIR FORCE RECON FOUND 56 KNOTS OVER THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT SEVERAL
HOURS AGO.  THE PRESENTATION ON SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO LOOK
MORE IMPRESSIVE.  LATEST SATELLITE-DERIVED INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE
3.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE...I.E. 55 KNOTS.  THERE IS EXCELLENT UPPER-
LEVEL OUTFLOW OVER THE STORM AND THE WATERS ARE QUITE WARM.  IRENE
IS LIKELY TO INTENSIFY INTO A HURRICANE IN 12 HOURS...ABOUT THE TIME
IT REACHES WESTERN CUBA.  ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS PREDICTED OVER
THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO.  HOWEVER INCREASING UPPER-LEVEL
SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS MAY LIMIT INTENSIFICATION LATER IN THE FORECAST
PERIOD.

A WELL-DEFINED MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES
IS APPROACHING THE U.S. EAST COAST...AND CURRENTLY PASSING THE
LONGITUDE OF IRENE.  AS THIS FEATURE BYPASSES THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
AND MOVES ON OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC...THE STEERING CURRENT NEAR IRENE
SHOULD WEAKEN.  HENCE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SLOWS THE FORWARD SPEED
DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO.  NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...A
NEW MIDLATITUDE TROUGH...WHICH IS CURRENTLY OVER NORTHWESTERN NORTH
AMERICA...IS EXPECTED TO DROP INTO THE MIDWEST.  THIS SHOULD PRODUCE
A SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING FLOW FOR IRENE.  HOWEVER THERE IS
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST LATER IN THE PERIOD AS
REFLECTED BY THE SPREAD OF THE TRACK GUIDANCE MODELS.  FOR EXAMPLE
THE U.K. MET. OFFICE MODEL KEEPS IRENE OVER THE EASTERN GULF THROUGH
72 HOURS BUT THE NAVY VERSION OF THE GFDL MODEL ACCELERATES THE
CYCLONE INTO EASTERN GEORGIA BY THAT TIME.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
A REASONABLE BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE...AND IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THAT

HURRICANE IRENE DISCUSSION NUMBER   4
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT THU OCT 14 1999
 
SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB SUGGEST THE CENTER
HAS MOVED SLIGHTLY WEST OF DUE NORTH AND HAS SLOWED DOWN A BIT.
ALTHOUGH THE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS UNABLE TO FLY NEAR THE
COAST OF CUBA DUE TO AIR FORCE REGULATIONS...THEY WERE ABLE TO
USE THE ON-BOARD RADAR TO ESTIMATE A CENTER.  THEIR ESTIMATE IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE SATELLITE TRENDS...AND THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS NOW 355/6 KT.  

WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE MID- TO UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER THE 
U.S. EAST COAST THE STEERING CURRENTS NEAR IRENE SHOULD WEAKEN. 
MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE IS IN AGREEMENT WITH A SLOW
GENERALLY NORTHWARD MOTION THROUGH 24-36 HRS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST 
SHOWS A SLOW GENERAL NORTHWARD SPEED DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO. 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...A NEW MID-LATITUDE TROUGH
...CURRENTLY OVER NORTHWESTERN NORTH AMERICA...IS EXPECTED TO MOVE
INTO THE MIDWEST.  THIS SHOULD PRODUCE A SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY
STEERING ENVIRONMENT FOR IRENE.  SEVERAL MODELS...BAMD...THE GFDL
AND UKMET...SHOW A NORTH-NORTHEAST TURN AND AN INCREASE IN SPEED 
BETWEEN 48 AND 72 HRS.  WHILE THE GUIDANCE IS MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED
ON THIS SCENARIO...THERE REMAINS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THIS
PORTION OF THE FORECAST. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY
TO THE LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN
THE UKMET AND GFDL GUIDANCE LATER IN THE PERIOD. 
 
IRENE CONTINUES TO HAVE AN IMPRESSIVE SATELLITE SIGNATURE WITH THE
CENTER EMBEDDED WITHIN VERY COLD CONVECTION...TOPS TO -80C. BASED 
ON SATELLITE-BASED DVORAK ESTIMATES...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS NOW
65 KT MAKING IRENE A HURRICANE. THE WESTERN PORTION OF CUBA IS
RATHER FLAT AND NARROW...AND HISTORICALLY HAS HAD MINIMAL IMPACT 
ON THE INTENSITY OF TROPICAL CYCLONES WHICH CROSS OVER THE REGION.
WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW AND WARM WATERS FURTHER
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...IN
AGREEMENT WITH SHIPS. HOWEVER INCREASING UPPER-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY
WINDS MAY LIMIT INTENSIFICATION LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
ALL INTERESTS IN FLORIDA SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
THIS STRENGTHENING STORM.  ADDITIONAL WATCHES...OR WARNINGS...MAY 
BE REQUIRED FOR SOME PORTION OF FLORIDA...AND THE KEYS...LATER
TODAY.

RADARS FROM CUBA AND KEY WEST...AND SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT
IRENE HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY FOR THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.
STEERING CURRENTS ARE WEAK AS SHOWN BY DATA FROM AN OVERNIGHT FLIGHT
OF THE NOAA GULFSTREAM JET.  THEREFORE...ONLY A VERY SLOW MOTION
TOWARD THE NORTH IS INDICATED FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  A NEW UPPER
TROUGH IS FORECAST TO SWEEP THROUGH THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL UNITED
STATES.  THIS PATTERN WOULD FORCE IRENE ON A NORTH-NORTHEASTERLY
TRACK LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN MOST OF
THE GUIDANCE AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  HOWEVER...THE NOGAPS MODEL
INDICATES THAT IRENE WILL MOVE VERY LITTLE OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECCONNAISSANCE PLANE IN THE AREA SINCE
YESTERDAY AND THE INTENSITY...65 KNOTS...IS BASED ON SATELLITE
IAMGERY.  THE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS ARE CONFINED TO A VERY SMALL
AREA NEAR THE CENTER.  A NOAA P3 PLANE WILL CHECK THE WIND STRUCTURE
ASSOCIATED WITH IRENE LATER TODAY.  STRENTHENING IS EXPECTED DURING
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS SUGGESTED BY GFDL COUPLED MODEL.

RADARS FROM CUBA AND KEY WEST...AND SATELLITE IMAGES...INDICATE THAT
IRENE MOVED TEMPORARILY TO THE NORTHEAST.  HOWEVER...MOST OF THE
GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT IRENE SHOULD RESUME A GENERAL NORTH TO NORTH-
NORTHEAST TRACK DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS...TAKING IRENE ACROSS THE

THE UNEXPECTED EASTWARD SHIFT OF THE TRACK OF IRENE REQUIRES THE
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE WATCHES AND WARNING.

INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN AT 65 KNOTS...BUT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. A
NOAA PLANE WILL BE IN THE AREA AND SHOULD GIVE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF
THE STRENGTH OF IRENE.  THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN OVER

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT THU OCT 14 1999
...VERY SLIGHT CORRECTION TO 12 HR FORECAST POSITION... 
IRENE IS POSING SOME FORECASTING CHALLENGES THIS EVENING.  A FEW
HOURS AGO...USING MORE RELIABLE CENTER FIXES FROM THE NOAA
AIRCRAFT...THE CENTER WAS RELOCATED SOMEWHAT TO THE WEST OF THE
PREVIOUS TRACK.  THIS WAS ALSO INDICATED BY KEY WEST RADAR...WHEN
THE EYE APPEARED TO REFORM IN THE VICINITY OF HAVANA.  MORE
RECENTLY...HOWEVER...THE RADAR PRESENTATION HAS DETERIORATED
MARKEDLY...AND THE LATEST FIXES FROM THE NOAA PLANE SHOW A SLOW AND
ERRATIC MOVEMENT.  HOWEVER...IRENE IS EXPECTED TO RESUME A NORTHWARD
COURSE AT AROUND 7 KNOTS.  THE RE-POSITIONING OF THE CENTER REQUIRES
A WESTWARD SHIFT OF THE FORECAST TRACK.  MID-TROPOSPHERIC HEIGHTS
ARE FORECAST TO RISE TO THE EAST OF FLORIDA AS A BROAD TROUGH MOVES
INTO THE CENTER PART OF THE U.S.  THIS SHOULD STEER IRENE NORTHWARD
SLOWLY FOR A DAY OR SO...WITH A GRADUAL BEND TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST AT A SLIGHTLY FASTER FORWARD SPEED LATER IN THE
PERIOD.  THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST TRACK IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH
THE U.K. MET. OFFICE AND LBAR GUIDANCE.
 
NOW THE OTHER CHALLENGE...FORECASTING THE INTENSITY.  IN SPITE OF
THE CURRENT RAGGEDNESS OF THE SYSTEM...WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE
IS A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR STRENGTHENING AS IRENE MOVES OVER THE
SOUTHEASTERN GULF.  THUS THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A SLIGHT
INCREASE IN STRENGTH...IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIPS MODEL
GUIDANCE.  HOWEVER...INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR COULD BE AN
INHIBITING FACTOR.
 
THE CURRENT FORECAST REQUIRES A NORTHWARD EXTENSION OF THE WATCHES
AND WARNINGS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
5 AM EDT FRI OCT 15 1999

...CORRECT ARE TO WINDS IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH...
 
WSR-88D DATA FROM KEY WEST AND REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE
HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATE THE CENTER OF IRENE RE-FORMED TO
THE EAST EARLY THIS MORNING...AS THE CYCLONE RESUMED A NORTHWARD
MOTION. SATELLITE CLOUD TOPS HAVE BEEN AS COLD AS -89C...AND A RADAR
EYE HAS BEEN COMING AND GOING. THE AIRCRAFT DID REPORT 85 KT FLIGHT
LEVEL WINDS WELL EAST OF THE CENTER...BUT THESE WINDS MAY HAVE BEEN
ASSOCIATED WITH A MESOCYCLONE IN AN OUTER BAND. THE MAXIMUM WINDS
REMAIN AT 65 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE...BUT THE GUSTS WILL BE RAISED TO
85 KT BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT DATA.

ALTHOUGH IRENE IS MOVING IN FITS AND STARTS...THE INITIAL MOTION IS
ESTIMATED TO BE 360/8. THE HURRICANE IS IN A WEAKNESS BETWEEN TWO
PARTS OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE...WITH THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE
RIDGE BEING SLIGHTLY STRONGER. THIS IS EXPECTED TO KEEP IRENE ON A
GENERALLY NORTHWARD TRACK THROUGH 36 TO 48 HOURS. THEREAFTER...A
DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. SHOULD PRODUCE A GRADUAL
TURN TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST AND A FASTER FORWARD MOTION. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS IN AGREEMENT WITH MOST FORECAST GUIDANCE.

THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS STILL QUITE CHALLENGING. ALTHOUGH THE
RADAR EYE IS CURRENTLY WEAKENING...AND IRENE SHOWS SOME SIGNS OF
SHEARING...THE CONVECTIVE TOPS ARE QUITE COLD AND THE NORTHWARD
MOTION MAY REDUCE THE STORM-RELATIVE SHEAR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST
WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR A SLIGHT STRENGTHENING...WHICH KEEPS IRENE
A CATEGORY ONE HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE UNTIL LANDFALL.
SLOW WEAKENING IS FORECAST THEREAFTER. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IRENE
IS VERY ASYMMETRICAL...WITH MOST OF THE CONVECTION OVER THE EASTERN
SEMICIRCLE.
 
THE CURRENT FORECAST REQUIRES A NORTHWARD EXTENSION OF THE HURRICANE
WATCH AND TROPICAL STORM WARNING ALONG THE FLORIDA EAST COAST.

...CORRECTION TO INDICATE THAT THE 48 HOUR POSITION IS NOT INLAND...

RECONNAISSANCE FIXES AND RADAR IMAGERY FROM THE KEY WEST RADAR
INDICATE THAT IRENE HAS BEEN MOVING AT AN AVERAGE TRACK OF 020/7
OVER THE LAST 6-12 HOURS.  SUPERIMPOSED ON THIS MEAN MOTION HAVE
BEEN BRIEF PERIODS OF STATIONARITY AND ABRUPT JUMPS.  WITH THIS
CONTINUED NET NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD TRACK...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE EAST.  ADDITIONAL WOBBLES IN THE PATH OF
IRENE ARE LIKELY PRIOR TO LANDFALL.  ON THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK...LANDFALL WILL OCCUR SOONER...WITHIN 12-18 HOURS.  LONGER
TERM...A MAJOR TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN
STATES AND ACCELERATE THE CYCLONE NORTHEASTWARD CLOSE TO THE COASTS
OF NORTHEAST FLORIDA...GEORGIA...AND SOUTH CAROLINA.

A RECENT RECONNAISSANCE REPORT OF 74 KNOTS AT 850 MB SUPPORTS AN
INTENSITY OF 65 KTS.  HOWEVER...THE SATELLITE DEPICTION HAS IMPROVED
SIGNIFICANTLY THIS MORNING...WITH VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS...AND A BIT
OF OUTFLOW HAS RETURNED TO THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  SOME
STRENTHENING IS EXPECTED PRIOR TO LANDFALL...BUT GIVEN THE POOR
ORGANIZATION OF THE INNER CORE...RAPID INTENSIFICATION OVER THE NEXT
12 HOURS SEEMS UNLIKELY.  IF THE HURRICANE TAKES ANOTHER JOG TO THE
NORTH HOWEVER...THIS WOULD DELAY LANDFALL AND ALLOW ADDITIONAL
STRENGTHENING.

WSR-88D DATA FROM MELBOURNE INDICATE THE IRREGULAR EYE OF IRENE IS
STRADDLING THE FLORIDA COAST JUST SOUTHEAST OF FT. PIERCE. THE
PASSAGE ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA MAY HAVE TAKEN A TOLL ON THE SYSTEM...
AS CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES NEAR THE SYSTEM HAVE WARMED SOMEWHAT
DURING THE NIGHT. HOWEVER...THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
HAS JUST REPORTED A 986 MB CENTRAL PRESSURE AND 77 KT WINDS NORTH OF
THE CENTER AT 850 MB. ALSO...SHIP ELUB8 REPORTED 65 KT WINDS EAST OF
FT. LAUDERDALE AT 03Z. THUS... HURRICANE STATUS IS MAINTAINED FOR
THIS PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 020/9...ALTHOUGH THE RADAR DATA SUGGESTS A
NORTHWARD WOBBLE IS IN PROGRESS. A STRONG MID LEVEL RIDGE EAST OF
IRENE SEEMS TO BE CAUSING THE LONG ANTICIPATED MORE NORTHERLY
MOTION. A COASTAL TROUGH IS FORMING NEAR THE CAROLINA COAST...AND
THIS MAY BE THE WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE THAT ALLOWS THIS TRACK TO
CONTINUE. HOWEVER...THERE ARE SOME CONFLICTING SIGNALS. FIRST...THE
LARGE CIRRUS PLUME EXTENDING NORTHEAST FROM THE HURRICANE SUGGESTS A
CONTINUED NORTHEASTWARD COMPONENT. SECOND...THE MODEL GUIDANCE
INDICATES A NORTHERLY MOTION...WITH THE GFDL TAKING THE SYSTEM TO
NEAR CHARLESTON SC BY 18/06Z. THE MODEL GUIDANCE HAS SHOWN A
DISTINCT LEFT BIAS DURING THIS STORM...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST WILL
BE SIMILAR...BUT A LITTLE EAST...OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.
 
WITH THE CURRENT RADAR PRESENTATION AND ANTICIPATED MOTION OVER THE
GULF STREAM...IRENE COULD INTENSIFY AS THE CENTER MOVES OVER OPEN
WATER. HOWEVER...THE CURRENT MORE NORTHWARD COULD ALSO RESULT IN
INCREASED SHEAR...ESPECIALLY NEAR THE 36 AND 48 HR FORECASTS. THE
OFFICIAL INTENSITY FORECAST MAINTAINS IRENE AS A 65 KT HURRICANE
THROUGH 36 HOURS...ALTHOUGH SOME FLUCTUATIONS COULD OCCUR. IRENE
SHOULD INTERACT WITH THE WESTERLIES AND BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY THE
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.
 
THE CURRENT FORECAST TRACK REQUIRES A HURRICANE WATCH ALONG PARTS OF

UPPER-LEVEL WINDS ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR STRENGTHENING BUT BECAUSE

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THAT IRENE HAS A VERY LARGE EYE WITH MINIMAL
DEEP CONVECTION.  THE HIGHEST RECENT RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHT-LEVEL
WIND WAS 72 KNOTS.  THIS MORNING A SHIP REPORTED 68 KTS...AND THE
PRESSURE HAS BEEN FALLING DURING THE DAY SO I AM RELUCTANT TO DROP
THE SURFACE ESTIMATE BELOW 70 KT.  THE MOST RECENT EXTRAPOLATED
ESTIMATE FROM THE AIRCRAFT WAS 982...BUT THESE ARE USUALLY TOO LOW
BY A COUPLE MB.  ALTHOUGH SHIPS INTENSITY GUIDANCE CALLS FOR LITTLE
CHANGE IN INTENSITY...IRENE WILL PASS OVER SOME WARM WATER PRIOR TO
LANDFALL AND SOME MODEST STRENGTHENING IS POSSIBLE IF THE CONVECTION
BECOMES MORE VIGOROUS. 

THE MOTION OF IRENE DURING THE DAY HAS BEEN ERRATIC AND RESEMBLES A
TROCHOIDAL OSCILLATION...WITH THE MEAN MOTION ESTIMATED AT 000/9. 
AN ESSENTIALLY NORTHWARD TRACK IS EXPECTED FOR ABOUT 24 HOURS...
FOLLOWED BY A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST AS THE CENTER APPROACHES THE
SOUTH CAROLINA COAST.  THIS PLACES A FAIRLY LARGE PORTION OF THE
COASTLINE UNDER THE RISK OF HURRICANE CONDITIONS.  THE PRIMARY
HAZARD WILL BE ADDITIONAL RAINS OVER THE ALREADY SATURATED CAROLINA
COASTAL PLAIN.

THE RADAR PRESENTATION HAS BECOME VERY UNIMPRESSIVE...AND THE LACK
OF ECHOES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO FIND THE PRECISE CENTER.  THERE IS
STILL A STRONG WIND CIRCULATION AS EVIDENCED BY THE SURFACE
OBSERVATIONS.  ALTHOUGH VERTICAL SHEAR IS NOT STRONG OVER THE SYSTEM
AT THIS TIME...THE ENTRAINMENT OF DRIER AIR INTO THE CIRCULATION HAS
CAUSED A DECREASE IN THE DEEP CONVECTION.  RECON DATA SHOW A
REDUCTION OF DEWPOINT TEMPERATURE IN THE EYE OF ABOUT 8 DEG C OVER
THE PAST 12 HOURS.  CURRENT INTENSITY IS SET AT 65 KNOTS AND NO
CHANGE IN INTENSITY IS FORECAST UNTIL LANDFALL.  NONETHELESS...IRENE
WILL BE CROSSING A SECTION OF THE GULF STREAM ON SUNDAY AND THIS
COULD REJUVENATE THE SYSTEM IF VERTICAL SHEAR DOES NOT INCREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY.
 
MOTION ESTIMATE IS 010/09.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...AND SHOWS A TURN TOWARD THE NORTHEAST WITH
ACCELERATION AS A LARGE 500 MB TROUGH APPROACHES IRENE FROM THE

WHILE A BURST OF STRONG CONVECTION HAS OCCURRED NEAR THE CENTER OF
IRENE OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...IT IS NOW WEAKENING AND BOTH THE
RADAR AND SATELLITE PRESENTATIONS REMAIN UNIMPRESSIVE.  HOWEVER...
THE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT RECENTLY REPORTED 850 MB WINDS AS
HIGH AS 71 KT AND A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 982 MB. IT IS LIKELY
THE DRY AIR SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SOUTH AND WEST OF IRENE IS
ENTRAINING INTO THE HURRICANE AND SUPPRESSING THE CONVECTION. THE
INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 65 KT.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 360/08. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A TROUGH
OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. HEADING FOR IRENE...ALONG WITH THE ASSOCIATED
COLD FRONT SEEN ON SURFACE ANALYSES. A BROAD EASTWARD-MOVING RIDGE
IS EVIDENT IN THE IMAGERY WITH AN AXIS ALONG 70W. THIS COMBINATION
OF FEATURES SHOULD GRADUALLY TURN IRENE TO THE NORTHEAST WITH
ACCELERATION OVER THE NEXT 36 HR. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
REFLECTS THIS AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MODEL GUIDANCE. THERE
ARE DISAGREEMENTS IN THE LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE AS TO THE EVENTUAL
FATE OF IRENE NEAR THE 36-48 HR FORECASTS.  THE ECMWF...UKMET...
AND ENVIRONMENT CANADA GLOBAL MODEL TRANSFORM IRENE INTO A LARGE 
AND VICIOUS EXTRATROPICAL LOW...WHILE THE AVN...NOGAPS...AND ETA
FAVOR A WEAKER AND MORE SHEARED OUT SOLUTION. THE NHC TRACK AND
INTENSITY FORECASTS ASSUME THE STRONGER SCENARIO.

ALTHOUGH IRENE SHOULD PASS ACROSS THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE GULF
STREAM BEFORE LANDFALL...THE LACK OF ORGANIZATION SHOULD LIKELY
PREVENT SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING. A COMBINATION OF LAND INTERACTION
...INCREASING SHEAR...AND COLDER AIR AND WATER SHOULD CAUSE IRENE 
TO WEAKEN AFTER LANDFALL. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR LITTLE

IRENE CONTINUES TO GENERATE JUST ENOUGH DEEP CONVECTION TO MAINTAIN
MINIMAL HURRICANE STATUS.   THE MOST RECENT PEAK WINDS FROM THE
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WERE 68 KNOTS...BUT THE AIRCRAFT HAS NOT YET 
SAMPLED THE CONVECTIVE BURST TO THE NORTH OF THE CENTER.  IRENE IS

COLD FRONT SEEN ON SURFACE ANALYSES. A BROAD EASTWARD-MOVING RIDGE
IS EVIDENT IN THE IMAGERY WITH AN AXIS NEAR 70W.  AS THE CENTER

GRADUALLY DEFLECT TO THE RIGHT.  THE CENTER IS LIKELY TO TRACK VERY
CLOSE TO THE COAST FROM CENTRAL SOUTH CAROLINA NORTHEASTWARD TO NEAR
CAPE HATTERAS...AND THE STRONGEST WINDS AT LANDFALL COULD OCCUR
ANYWHERE IN THIS INTERVAL.  

RAINFALL ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN INCREASED...TO 4 TO 8 INCHES OF

WINDS ARE STILL LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE CENTER.
 
RADAR AND RECONNAISSANCE FIXES INDICATE THAT IRENE HAS CONTINUED THE
NORTHEAST MOTION AND IS ACCELERATING.  INITIAL MOTION IS 060/20. 
THIS MOTION LESSENS THE THREAT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST...AND IS
THE REASON FOR DOWNGRADING TO TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS.  TRACK

WIND CENTER ASSOCIATED WITH THE CENTRAL CONVECTION OF IRENE. 850 MB
FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS WERE 114 KT JUST SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER...AND
129 KT WINDS WERE OBSERVED AT 902 MB ON AN EYEWALL DROPSONDE. THE

IRENE HAS ACCELERATED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS...AND THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOW 055/30. THERE IS LITTLE TO SAY WITH REGARDS TO TRACK
OR INTENSITY. IRENE SHOULD CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE TO THE NORTHEAST

BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED AND HAS DEVELOPED BANDING FEATURES...A BROAD
LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION AND AN EXCELLENT UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW.  SHIP
MTQU3...LOCATED NORTH OF THE DEVELOPING CENTER REPORTED 20-KNOT
EASTERLY WINDS AND 1006 MB PRESSURE.  THIS IS ENOUGH TO BEGIN
ADVISORIES ON TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOURTEEN.   BECAUSE THE DEPRESSION
IS IN THE FORMATIVE STAGE...THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER IS POORLY
ORGANIZED.  THIS MAY RESULT IN SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN BOTH INITIAL
POSITION AND LOCATION. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST CALLS FOR STRENGTHENING
SINCE THERE WILL BE A LOW-SHEAR ENVIRONMENT AND SHIPS MODEL BRINGS
THE DEPRESSION TO A 75-KNOT HURRICANE BY 72 HOURS. 

INITIAL MOTION IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BUT BEST ESTIMATE IS 275/10.
THERE IS A STRONG 500-MB RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING WESTWARD
OVER THE ATLANTIC. THIS SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH WESTWARD STEERING TO
BRING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE OVER THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN BY 72 HOURS.
THIS IS THE SOLUTION PRODUCED BY MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS EXCEPT
NOGAPS WHICH TURN THE SYSTEM NORTHWARD BEFORE REACHING THE LESSER
ANTILLES.  WITH THIS TRACK IN MIND...A HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE
REQUIRED FOR PORTIONS OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS AS EARLY AS TONIGHT.

THE SYSTEM IS STILL IN ITS FORMATIVE STAGES AND THE CENTER LOCATION
REMAINS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN.  THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION
IS 280/9.  A BURST OF DEEP CONVECTION HAS RECENTLY FIRED JUST NORTH
OF THE CENTER AND MULTI-CHANNEL SATELLITE IMAGERY IS SHOWING HINTS
THAT THE CENTER MAY BE REFORMING CLOSER TO THIS CONVECTIVE CLUSTER.
THUS...THE CENTER MAY HAVE TO BE RE-LOCATED LATER THIS MORNING WHEN
VISIBLE IMAGERY BECOMES AVAILABLE. ALSO...AN AIR FORCE RESERVE
HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO INVESTIGATE JOSE THIS
AFTERNOON. 

OTHERWISE...THERE IS NOT MUCH CHANGE TO THE FORECAST TRACK
PHILOSOPHY FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AS A LARGE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
ANTICYCLONE DEPICTED IN THE GLOBAL MODELS OVER THE SOUTHWEST NORTH
ATLANTIC SHOULD STEER JOSE ON A GENERAL WESTWARD TRACK THROUGH 12
HRS WITH A GRADUAL TURN TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST THEREAFTER.  THIS WILL
MOVE THE TROPICAL CYCLONE INTO THE EXTREME EASTERN CARIBBEAN BY THE
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO 
THE STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL MODEL NHC98...AND REPRESENTS A SLIGHT
RIGHTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK PROMPTS THE ISSUANCE OF A HURRICANE
WATCH FOR BARBADOS...AND HAS BEEN COORDINATED WITH THE BARBADOS
WEATHER SERVICE.  A HURRICANE WATCH WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED FOR
PORTIONS OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS LATER TODAY.  ALL INTERESTS IN 
LESSER ANTILLES ISLANDS SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF 
THIS DEVELOPING TROPICAL CYCLONE.

THE STRUCTURE OF JOSE IS IMPROVING ON VISIBLE SATELLITE ANIMATION
THIS MORNING...ALTHOUGH THE COLDEST CLOUD TOPS IN THE IR ARE NOT
WELL ORGANIZED YET.  SATELLITE CLASSIFICATIONS AT 12Z FROM TAFB AND
SAB WERE BOTH 35 KT.  THE UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO LOOK VERY
FAVORABLE.   BASED ON THE VISIBLE ANIMATION AND THE FORECAST FOR
STRENGTHENING TODAY...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS INCREASED TO 40 KT. 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST FOLLOWS THE SHIPS MODEL CLOSELY...AND BRINGS
JOSE TO HURRICANE STRENGTH WITHIN 36 HOURS.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 285/9.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE...AND IS ROUGHLY
HALFWAY BETWEEN THE MEDIUM BAM AND CLIPER.  SOME OF THE GUIDANCE
MODELS SHOW JOSE IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF A BROADER CYCLONIC
CIRCULATION... WHICH RESULTS IN A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK THAN
INDICATED BY THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  LONGER TERM...THERE IS A SPLIT
BETWEEN THE UKMET AND NOGAPS...WHICH TURN JOSE BACK TOWARD THE
WEST...AND THE GFDL RUN OFF THE NAVY NOGAPS FIELDS...WHICH SUGGESTS
THE BEGINNING OF A RECURAVATURE TRACK.  IT IS TOO SOON TO TELL
WHETHER JOSE POSES A THREAT TO THE CONTINENTAL U.S.

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO
INVESTIGATE JOSE THIS AFTERNOON.  A HURRICANE WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR
BARBADOS...AND ADDITIONAL WATCHES IN THE LESSER ANTILLES WILL LIKELY
BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY.

THE AIRCRAFT FOUND THE CENTER OF JOSE TO BE NORTH OF PREVIOUS
SATELLITE ESTIMATES.  MUCH OF THIS NORTHWARD DISPLACEMENT IS
BELIEVED TO BE A REORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCULATION...BUT THE INITIAL
MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE 295/10...A BIT TO THE RIGHT OF THE

FORECAST IS UNCHANGED BUT THE TRACK IS SHIFTED NORTHWARD TO CORRECT

THE LAST RECON FIX WAS AT 2251Z...AND DID NOT SHOW ANY
INTENSIFICATION.  HOWEVER THE CLOUD PATTERN HAS CONTINUED TO BECOME
BETTER ORGANIZED.  DVORAK CLASSIFICATIONS...USING A CURVED BAND
PATTERN ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...GIVE A CURRENT INTENSITY ESTIMATE OF
45 KNOTS.  SINCE THE VERTICAL SHEAR IS WEAK AND THERE IS A
SUBSTANTIAL UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SYSTEM...CONTINUED
STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.  THE NAVY VERSION OF THE GFDL MODEL AND
THE AIR FORCE WEATHER AGENCY MESOSCALE MODEL BOTH SHOW
INTENSIFICATION DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS WELL.  JOSE SHOULD BE
NEARING HURRICANE STRENGTH IN A DAY OR SO.
 
SATELLITE-DERIVED POSITION ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN A BIT TO THE SOUTH OF
THE AIRCRAFT ONES.  MY LOCATION AND MOTION ESTIMATES ARE BIASED MORE
TOWARD THE RECON BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES IN SATELLITE
ESTIMATES.  CURRENT MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/11.  OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL HOURS THERE HAS BEEN A TENDENCY FOR THE STORM TO MOVE MORE
TO THE RIGHT OF ITS PREVIOUS TRACK.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A
SMALL MID/UPPER LEVEL CYCLONIC VORTEX IN THE VICINITY OF 20N 60W.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS FEATURE COULD TURN THE STORM MORE
NORTHWESTWARD DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO.  MY FORECAST IS
SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK...BUT
ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK PREDICTION SUITE.

JOSE HAS BECOME BETTER ORGANIZED THIS EVENING WITH COLDER TOPS AND
INCREASED BANDING AROUND THE CENTER. SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES
FROM TAFB AND SAB HAVE INCREASED TO 55 KT...WHICH WILL BE THE
INITIAL INTENSITY FOR THIS PACKAGE.

ALTHOUGH THE CENTER SEEMS TO HAVE JUMPED AROUND SOME DURING THE
NIGHT...THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE REMAINS 300/11. JOSE IS SOUTH OF
A LARGE RIDGE COVERING THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE
INDICATES THE RIDGE SHOULD CHANGE LITTLE OVER THE NEXT THREE
DAYS..WHICH SUGGESTS A CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT WEST-NORTHWEST
MOTION. NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT WITH THE
SCENARIO. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE
GFDL...WHICH TURNS THE CYCLONE MORE TO THE NORTHWEST AFTER 48
HOURS...AND THE UKMET...WHICH TRACKS JOSE WEST-NORTHWEST ACROSS
PUERTO RICO.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES AN ANTICYCLONE OVER JOSE...WHICH
SHOULD ALLOW FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THE AVN...UKMET...AND NOGAPS ALL
FORECAST THIS ANTICYCLONE TO MOVE WEST-NORTHWEST WITH THE STORM...
WHICH COULD ALLOW IT TO BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE. HOWEVER...
THESE MODELS ALSO INDICATED SUCH AN ANTICYCLONE WOULD DEVELOP OVER
TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWELVE...AND THAT FORECAST WAS A TOTAL BUST. THE
INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR MORE STRENGTHENING THAN THE PREVIOUS
PACKAGE...BUT NOT TO MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS. IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE
SHIPS MODEL FORECASTS SIGNIFICANT SHEAR OVER JOSE AND ONLY BRINGS
IT TO 83 KT IN 72 HOURS.
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS HAVE BEEN REVISED BASED ON THE MOTION AND
CURRENT FORECASTS. ADDITIONAL WATCHES FOR THE U.S. AND BRITISH
VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO MAY BE REQUIRED LATER TODAY.
 
ALL LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE DEVELOPS A LARGE DEEP LAYER TROUGH OVER THE

RECONNAISSANCE PLANE FOUND FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS OF 73 KNOTS ON A SMALL

LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO MOVE WITH THE HURRICANE...FURTHER
STRENGTHENING IS INDICATED.  

INITIAL MOTION IS 300/11.  A PERSISTENT STRONG 500 MB RIDGE TO THE
NORTH OF JOSE SHOULD PROVIDE A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST STEERING
DURING THE NEXT 3 DAYS AND THIS IS THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OF THE
MODELS.  ONLY THE GFDL TURNS THE HURRICANE MORE TO THE NORTHWEST

THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED VERY MUCH DURING THE PAST
SIX HOURS. THE MAIN FEATURES ARE A CURVED CONVECTIVE BAND TO THE
EAST AND SOUTH OF THE CENTER AND GOOD OUTFLOW.  MINIMUM PRESSURE IS
992 MB AND THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS THAT THE RECON REPORTED AN
ELONGATED EYEWALL OPEN TO THE WEST.  INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS AT 65
KNOTS AND I AM BEING GENEROUS.  BECAUSE AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE IS
FORECAST TO MOVE WITH THE HURRICANE...FURTHER STRENGTHENING IS
INDICATED.
 
JOSE APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN A JOG MORE TO NORTHWEST OR NORTH DURING
PAST HOUR OR SO...PERHAPS IT IS A REFORMATION OF THE CENTER.
HOWEVER...WITH A STRONG 500 MB HIGH TO THE NORTH...JOSE SHOULD TURN
BACK TO A TRACK BETWEEN WEST-NORTHWEST AND NORTHWEST.  NONE OF THE
AVAILABLE MODELS INDICATE THE HURRICANE WILL TURN TO THE NORTH
BEFORE 36 OR 48 HOURS AND ALL MODELS UNANIMOUSLY BRING JOSE TO THE
NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN.  THEREFORE...A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TO

THE LATEST RECONNAISSANCE DATA RELAYED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE
HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT JOSE HAS BEEN MOVING ON
A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK...315/11..OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS.
THIS IS TO THE RIGHT OF OUR PREVIOUS TRACK.  HOWEVER IT MAY BE
TEMPORARY...SINCE MID-TROPOSPHERIC OBSERVATIONS GATHERED BY THE NOAA
JET IMPLY SUBSTANTIAL RIDGING NORTH AND NORTHWEST OF THE HURRICANE.
THIS RIDGE COULD FORCE THE MOVEMENT BACK TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST ON
WEDNESDAY.  OUR CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED SOMEWHAT
TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT NOT AS MUCH TO THE RIGHT AS
IMPLIED BY THE CURRENT MOTION.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE U.K. MET
OFFICE MODEL PREDICTION...AND THE MOST RECENT NAVY VERSION OF THE
GFDL MODEL ALSO SHOWS A SIMILAR TRACK.
 
AIR FORCE RECON REPORTED FLIGHT-LEVEL...850 MB...WINDS OF 91 KNOTS
AND THIS IMPLIES MAXIMUM SURFACE WINDS OF 70 KNOTS.  CENTRAL
PRESSURE...MEASURED BY DROPSONDE...WAS DOWN TO 986 MB.  THE RECON

SATELLITE IMAGERY AND HURRICANE HUNTER DATA INDICATE STRENGTHENING
OVERNIGHT. THE LAST REPORTED MINIMUM PRESSURE WAS 980 MB...AND THE
MAXIMUM 850 MB WINDS WERE 99 KT. SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES VERY
COLD CLOUD TOPS TO -85C AND THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED A 30 NM WIDE EYE
OPEN TO THE SOUTH. THIS INTENSIFICATION OCCURRED DESPITE RESTRICTED
OUTFLOW OR POSSIBLE SHEAR ON THE WEST SIDE ON THE DEEP CONVECTION.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS SET TO 80 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 315/10. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A
MID/UPPER LEVEL VORTEX NEAR 25N66W THAT MAY BE WEAKENING THE RIDGE
NORTH OF JOSE AND ALLOWING A NORTHWESTWARD MOTION. HOWEVER...THE
VORTEX IS MOVING WESTWARD...WHICH LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF
JOSE MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD LATER TODAY. A GENERAL NORTHWEST TO
WEST-NORTHWEST MOTION IS EXPECTED THROUGH 48 HOURS...FOLLOWED BY A
MORE NORTHERLY MOTION AS A LARGE DEEP LAYER TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER
THE EASTERN U.S. AFFECTS JOSE. ALL LARGE SCALE AND HURRICANE
GUIDANCE AGREES ON THIS. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED
SOMEWHAT TO THE NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...BUT IS ALONG THE
LEFT SIDE OF THE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE. IT IS ALSO SLOWER THAN MUCH OF
THE GUIDANCE AT 72 HOURS...AS THE VARIOUS BAM MODELS...NOGAPS...
GFDN...AND UKMET FORECAST JOSE NORTH OF 28N BY THAT TIME.
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS STILL SOMEWHAT OF A PARADOX. WHILE THE AVN
AND NOGAPS CONTINUE TO MOVE AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE NORTHWEST
WITH THE HURRICANE...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS SOUTHWESTERLY UPPER
LEVEL FLOW AHEAD OF JOSE. THESE WIND MAXIMA OFTEN DO NOT WEAKEN AS
FAST AS THE MODELS WOULD SUGGEST. THERE ARE ALSO THE FACTORS THAT
JOSE IS STEADILY INTENSIFYING AT THIS TIME...AND THAT THE SHIPS
MODEL WEAKENS THE SYSTEM AFTER 48 HOURS. THE INTENSITY FORECAST
SLOWS THE CURRENT INTENSIFICATION AFTER 12 HOURS AND PEAKS THE STORM
AT 100 KT IN 36 HOURS. SHOULD THE SHEAR DECREASE OR STAY AT CURRENT
VALUES...JOSE COULD GET MUCH STRONGER THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.
 
THE 64 KT AND 50 KT WIND RADII ARE ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY BASED ON THE
AIRCRAFT DATA. THE 34 KT WIND RADII ARE UNCHANGED...AND ARE IN

HURRICANE JOSE DISCUSSION NUMBER  14
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 PM EDT WED OCT 20 1999
 
THE LATEST REPORT RECEIVED FROM THE AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE
HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT JOSE IS MOVING A TAD TO THE LEFT
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST TRACK...AND THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW
300/9 KT.  THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE SYNOPTIC REASONING REGARDING
THE TRACK FORECAST WITH A GENERAL WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION
THROUGH 24 HRS.  THEREAFTER...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE BENDS TO NORTH...
THEN NORTH-NORTHEAST AND ACCELERATES AS A MID-UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
MOVES INTO THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK
IS SLIGHTLY LEFT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WITH THE U.K. METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE AND THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL
OUTPUT.  THE GLOBAL MODELS ALSO SUGGEST THAT JOSE WILL BE CLOSE TO
MERGING WITH A FRONTAL CYCLONE BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...
SO JOSE MAY BE LOSING ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS BY THAT TIME. 
 
THERE WAS A RECENT DROPSONDE MEASUREMENT OF 994 MB SURFACE PRESSURE
BY THE HURRICANE HUNTERS.  HOWEVER...THE SURFACE WINDS ON THE DROP
INDICATE THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE CENTER SO THE ESTIMATED MINIMUM
PRESSURE IS KEPT AT 990 MB.  THE CLOUD PATTERN SEEN IN SATELLITE
IMAGERY IS NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE ALTHOUGH THE CENTER IS EMBEDDED
WITHIN A CDO WITH VERY DEEP CONVECTION...TOPS TO -85C...WHICH HAS
BEEN EXPANDING DURING THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS.  IR SATELLITE IMAGERY
SUGGESTS THAT THE SYSTEM IS EXPERIENCING SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR AND
THIS IS CONFIRMED IN SYNOPTIC FLOW DATA SUPPLIED BY THE NOAA G-IV
AIRCRAFT. THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 85 KT FOR THIS
ADVISORY.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE LIKELY WHILE JOSE IS
INTERACTING WITH THE LEEWARD ISLANDS. THE FORECAST STILL ALLOWS FOR
SOME SLIGHT STRENGTHENING THROUGH 36 HRS.  THIS PRESUMES THAT THE
SHEAR DOES NOT BECOME PROHIBITIVELY STRONG.

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS THE CENTER PASSING NORTH AND EAST
OF PUERTO RICO IN 12-24 HOURS.  ONE SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON THIS PRECISE
TRACK BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES.  THE LONG-TERM AVERAGE
TRACK FORECAST ERROR IS CLOSE TO 100 STATUTE MILES AT 24 HOURS.

5 AM EDT THU OCT 21 1999
 
REPORTS FROM AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT OVER THE
PAST 18 HOURS INDICATE THAT JOSE IS WEAKENING UNDER RELENTLESS
SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR.  THE MINIMUM PRESSURE HAS RISEN TO 992...UP 11
MB SINCE 13Z YESTERDAY...AND THE HIGHEST FLIGHT-LEVEL WIND RECORDED
BY THE AIRCRAFT IN THE LAST 12 HOURS HAS BEEN 65 KT.  THE CENTER OF
CIRCULATION IS ON THE SOUTHWESTERN EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION...THE
TEMPERATURES OF WHICH HAVE BEEN WARMING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. 
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 65 KT...AND IT IS IN FACT
QUESTIONABLE WHETHER ANY SUSTAINED HURRICANE FORCE WINDS EXIST AT
THE SURFACE.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE SHEAR MAY LESSEN
IN ANOTHER DAY OR SO...SO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST ALLOWS SOME MODEST
AND BRIEF REINTENSIFICATION.

JOSE IS PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK BUT AT A SLIGHTLY FASTER SPEED...WITH
AN INITIAL MOTION OF 300/12.  THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE SYNOPTIC
REASONING REGARDING THE TRACK FORECAST...WITH A GENERAL
WEST-NORTHWEST TO NORTHWEST MOTION THROUGH 24 HRS.  THEREAFTER...THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE BENDS TO NORTH...THEN NORTH-NORTHEAST AND
ACCELERATES AS A MID TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVES INTO THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  THE GLOBAL MODELS ALSO SUGGEST THAT JOSE WILL BE CLOSE TO
MERGING WITH A FRONTAL CYCLONE BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...
SO JOSE MAY BE LOSING ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS BY THAT TIME.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
11 AM EDT THU OCT 21 1999

STRONG WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WE HAVE BEEN
OBSERVING IN WV IMAGES SINCE YESTERDAY...HAVE PARTIALLY REMOVED THE
DEEP CONVECTION FROM THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER OF JOSE.  THIS IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASE IN THE CENTRAL PRESSURE REPORTED BY
RECON.  JOSE IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM AT THIS TIME. 
MANY TROPICAL CYCLONES WEAKEN IN THIS REGION AS THEY INTERACT WITH
THE MID-OCEANIC UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WHICH NORMALLY IS LOCATED IN THIS
AREA. GLOBAL MODELS INSIST ON DEVELOPING AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OVER
JOSE.  IF THIS IS THE CASE...THE TROPICAL CYCLONE COULD RESTRENGTHEN
ONCE IT TURNS NORTHWARD AND THIS IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.

BECAUSE JOSE HAS BEEN SHEARED...THE LOW-LEVEL CENTER HAS BEEN MOVING
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD WITH THE LOW TO MIDDLE LEVEL FLOW.  HOWEVER...THE
LARGE TROUGH WHICH IS FORECAST TO SWEEP THE EASTERN UNITED STATES
AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH NORTH AND NORTH-
NORTHEASTWARD STEERING DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH MOST OF THE GUIDANCE.

THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 300/08.  ALL OF THE GUIDANCE MODELS
SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE NORTH THEN NORTH-NORTHEAST IN RESPONSE TO A
MAJOR TROUGH IN THE WESTERLIES MOVING FROM THE U.S. TO THE WESTERN
NORTH ATLANTIC.  THE 12Z UKMET AND GFDL MODELS ACCELERATES THE
FORWARD MOTION TO 40 KNOTS OR MORE AFTER 48 HOURS WHILE THE AVIATION
MODEL IS MUCH SLOWER.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE UKMET MODEL
AND IS A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF THE GFDL MODEL.
 
THE RECON SURFACE PRESSURE WAS 993 MB AT 1730Z AND THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS KEPT AT 55 KNOTS...ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO RECON IN
THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT SINCE THIS MORNING AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE
VERY DEEP CONVECTION IN THAT QUADRANT.  GUIDANCE MODELS SHOW THE
POSSIBILITY OF STRENGTHENING AGAIN AND THE WIND SPEED IS FORECAST TO
65 KNOTS IN 24 HOURS.  JOSE IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY
72 HOURS AS IT INTERACTS WITH THE APPROACHING TROUGH AND MOVES OVER
COLD WATER.
 
THE LATEST SURFACE WIND OBSERVATIONS FROM THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND
PUERTO RICO ARE ALL LESS THAT SUSTAINED TROPICAL STORM FORCE AND THE
WARNINGS ARE DISCONTINUED AT THIS TIME.

A TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE WATCH MAY BE NEEDED FOR BERMUDA LATER
TONIGHT OR EARLY FRIDAY.

THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DOPPLER RADAR
IN SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO INDICATES THAT THE CENTER OF JOSE IS LOCATED
ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF A LARGE CLUSTER OF VERY DEEP CONVECTION. THE
INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 305/08 KT.  THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE

INTO THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS
A MARKED ACCELERATION BETWEEN 36 AND 72 HRS...IN GENERAL AGREEMENT
WITH THE GFDL AND UKMET....AND IS SLIGHTLY RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS

REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT
OVERNIGHT INDICATE THAT JOSE IS BEGINNING ITS TURN TO THE NORTH. 
THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 330/7.  THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND
THE TRACK FORECAST REMAINS UNCHANGED AS JOSE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE
GENERALLY NORTHWARD TODAY AND ACCELERATE NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD ON
SATURDAY...IN RESPONSE TO A LARGE MID- TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVING
FROM THE EASTERN U.S. INTO THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC.  THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST TRACK IS ADJUSTED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT OF AND SLOWER THAN
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS...TO
ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE IN INITIAL MOTION.  THE FORECAST ACCELERATION
LATE IN THE PERIOD IS NOT AS LARGE AS INDICATED BY THE UKMET.
 
JOSE HAS BEEN MAINTAINING VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS AND THE RECON FIXES
SHOW THAT THE CENTER IS NOW JUST INSIDE THE DEEP CONVECTION.  THE
HIGHEST FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS WERE ABOUT 55 KT NORTH OF THE CENTER.  I
AM HOLDING THE INTENSITY AT 55 KT GIVEN THE IMPROVED APPEARANCE OF
THE STORM...EVEN THOUGH THE FLIGHT LEVEL WINDS WOULD SUGGEST A
SLIGHTLY LOWER SURFACE WIND ESTIMATE AT THIS TIME.  THE OFFICIAL
INTENSITY FORECAST IS A BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE SHIPS MODEL
GUIDANCE...WHICH BRINGS JOSE TO 61 KT IN 36 HOURS.  JOSE IS EXPECTED
TO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY 72 HOURS AS IT INTERACTS AND/OR MERGES

TIGHT CENTER.  UPPER-LEVEL WINDS NEVER RELAXED AS EXPECTED OR
FORECAST BY GLOBAL MODELS.  HOWEVER...IF JOSE BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARD

MEASURED A SURFACE PRESSURE OF 999 MB...INDICATING AN EXTREMELY WEAK

RESEARCH DIVISION...BASED ON THESE OBSERVATIONS...SHOWS A PEAK
SURFACE WIND OF 49 KT.  THE OFFICIAL INTENSITY IS DROPPED TO 50 KT

THE INTENSITY FORECAST ALLOWS SLIGHT STRENGTHENING AS THE SHEAR JUST

RECENT PASS THROUGH THE CENTER THE AIRCRAFT FOUND A VERY LARGE AREA
OF LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS AND COULD NOT FIND A SINGLE WELL DEFINED
CENTER.  IF THE SHEAR DOES NOT LESSEN VERY SOON...JOSE MAY DISSIPATE

IMAGES SHOW THAT THE LLCC REMAINS ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE OF THE DEEP
CONVECTION AND THAT THE SYSTEM REMAINS IN A SHEARED ENVIRONMENT.
LATEST SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES REMAIN AT 55 AND 45 KNOTS FROM
MIAMI AND WASHINGTON RESPECTIVELY.  THUS...INITIAL INTENSITY WILL
REMAIN AT 50 KNOTS.  OFFICIAL FORECAST MAINTAINS THE SYSTEM AT 50
KNOTS UNTIL IT BECOMES EXTRATROPICAL IN 36 HOURS.  GLOBAL MODELS
SUGGEST THAT THE SURFACE WIND FIELD ON THE EASTERN HALF OF THE
SYSTEM WILL EXPAND AS THE SYSTEM BECOMES EXTRATROPICAL AND THIS IS
REFLECTED IN THE WIND RADII FORECAST.

INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 025/13 KNOTS.  TRACK GUIDANCE REMAINS VERY
SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS PACKAGES AND ACCELERATES THE SYSTEM TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST AHEAD OF MAJOR MID-LATITUDE TROUGH APPROACHING FROM
THE WEST.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

ALTHOUGH JOSE REMAINS A SHEARED SYSTEM...THERE IS ENOUGH CIRRUS
EXTENDING WESTWARD FROM THE CONVECTION TO OBSCURE THE LOW LEVEL
CENTER. THIS MAKES THE INITIAL MOTION RATHER UNCERTAIN...BUT THE
BEST ESTIMATE IS STILL 025/13. THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THINKING
FROM THE PAST FEW ADVISORIES...AS JOSE SHOULD ACCELERATE NORTH-
NORTHEASTWARD IN FRONT OF THE DEEP LAYER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD
FRONT OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC UNTIL IT BECOMES EXTRATROPICAL.

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...AFWA...AND SAB REMAIN 55
KT...55 KT...AND 45 KT RESPECTIVELY...SO THE INITIAL INTENSITY
REMAINS 50 KT. WHILE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SUGGESTS UPPER LEVEL
DIFLUENCE IS INCREASING OVER JOSE...THE DEEP CONVECTION IS POORLY
ENOUGH ORGANIZED THAT STRENGTHENING IS UNLIKELY BEFORE EXTRATROPICAL
TRANSITION IN 36 HOURS.

A TRMM OVERPASS FROM THE NRL HOMEPAGE AT 0517Z SHOWED THAT THE LOW-
LEVEL CENTER OF JOSE WAS BETTER ENGAGED WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION. 
THIS WOULD SUGGEST SOME STRENGTHENING...AND INDEED THE SATELLITE
CLASSIFICATION FROM TAFB WAS UP TO 65 KT.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS
INCREASED TO 60 KT FOR THIS PACKAGE.  SSTS SHOULD BE DECREASING
ALONG THE FORECAST TRACK SO NO ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST.

THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE FORECAST TRACK. JOSE WILL
ACCELERATE NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD IN ADVANCE OF THE MAJOR TROUGH IN THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC AND GRADUALLY LOSE TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE UKMET GUIDANCE.  SOME

MONTERY TROPICAL CYCLONE HOMEPAGE CONFIRM THAT THE CENTER IS WELL
EMBEDDED WITHIN THE DEEP CONVECTION.  LATEST DVORAK DATA T-NUMBERS
SUPPORT HURRICANE STRENGTH...SO JOSE IS BEING UPGRADED AGAIN.  NO

THE LAST RECONNAISSANCE FIX WAS AT 2223Z...WHEN THE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT REPORTED A PEAK WIND OF 37 KT AT 1500 FT AND A MINIMUM
PRESSURE OF 1002 MB.  AT THAT TIME THE CENTER WAS ON THE EASTERN
EDGE OF THE DEEP CONVECTION AND WAS MOVING LITTLE.  ALTHOUGH THE
CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE...IT APPEARS HAVE RESUMED A MOSTLY
WESTWARD MOTION OF 280/5.  THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ESTIMATE...AS THERE IS A MID-LEVEL VORTEX TO
THE WEST OF THE PRESUMED CENTER THAT IS MOVING MORE RAPIDLY
WESTWARD.

THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. 
THE DEPRESSION IS EMBEDDED IN LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW AT MID-LEVELS THAT
SHOULD TAKE THE SYSTEM TO THE NICARAGUAN COAST WITHIN 18-30 HOURS. 
BEYOND THAT...A TROUGH FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO
COULD IMPART A MORE NORTHWESTWARD TRACK...IF THE SYSTEM SURVIVES
SOME FAIRLY ROUGH TERRAIN IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  THE MAIN THREAT FROM
THE DEPRESSION IS HEAVY RAINFALL.  THE COLOMBIAN METEOROLOGICAL
SERVICE REPORTS THAT SAN ANDRES RECEIVED 3.58 INCHES OF RAIN IN THE
LAST SIX HOURS.

THE INITIAL INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS 30 KT...WITH SATELLITE
ESTIMATES 0F 30 AND 35 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB RESPECTIVELY.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL PREDICTS A SIGNIFICANT LESSENING OF THE
EASTERLY SHEAR NOW OVER THE DEPRESSION...AND BRINGS THE SYSTEM TO 52

AS IS THE CASE WITH INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY AND WEAK SYSTEMS THE
CENTER IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE...CENTER FIXES FROM SAB AND MIAMI
SUGGEST THAT THE LLCC IS STILL PROGRESSING WESTWARD AT ABOUT 5 KNOTS
BUT THE DEEP CONVECTION IS A LITTLE FARTHER WEST OF THE CENTER
COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ANALYSES.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
285/05.  A COMPLICATING FACTOR IS THE SAN ANDRES WIND OBSERVATION AT
06 UTC OF 350/10...WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A LOW PRESSURE
CENTER TO THE EAST NORTHEAST OF THE ISLAND.  IN FACT...THE ARRIVAL
OF THE TROPICAL WAVE FROM THE EAST...NOW LOCATED ABOUT 78-79W...MAY
BE CAUSING AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE WIND FIELD AS THE TWO SYSTEMS MERGE
AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A NEW CENTER MAY FORM.  THIS WILL BE MORE
EVIDENT WITH THE VISIBLE IMAGERY LATER THIS MORNING.

TRACK MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN TWO CAMPS.  THE BAMS...STATISTICAL AND
STATISTICAL/DYNAMICAL MOVE THE SYSTEM WESTWARD...WHILE THE
LBAR...UKMET...AND AVN TAKE A MORE NORTHWESTWARD MOTION. IN EITHER
CASE THE SYSTEM WILL BE OVER LAND FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME
AND MAY DISSIPATE.  HOWEVER...IF THE NORTHWESTWARD TRACK PREVAILS
AND THE SYSTEM CAN SURVIVE IT WILL MOVE INTO THE GULF OF HONDURAS
AND MAY REINTENSIFY...WHICH IS WHAT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST DOES.  THE
OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY. THE MAIN
THREAT FROM THE DEPRESSION REMAINS THE POTENTIAL HEAVY RAINFALL.
   
THE INITIAL INTENSITY ESTIMATE REMAINS AT 30 KT...WITH SATELLITE
ESTIMATES 0F 30 AND 35 KT FROM SAB AND TAFB RESPECTIVELY.  THE SHIPS
INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL CONTINUES TO PREDICT A SIGNIFICANT
LESSENING OF THE EASTERLY SHEAR NOW OVER THE DEPRESSION...AND
FORECASTS THE SYSTEM TO A TROPICAL STORM PRIOR TO LANDFALL.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS REASONING AND MAKES THE SYSTEM A
MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM BEFORE LANDFALL.

REVEAL A PARTIALLY EXPOSED CENTER ON THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE DEEP

ANDRES ISLAND WHICH REPORTED SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS.  THUS...THE
CENTER HAS BEEN RE-LOCATED NORTH OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY POSITION.
AN EXTENDED SATELLITE LOOP SUGGESTS THAT THE CENTER HAS BEEN MOVING
ON A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK SINCE LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON...AND
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW 320/08 KNOTS.

THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL BE HELD AT 30 KNOTS.  THE DEPRESSION 
IS EXPERIENCING EASTERLY SHEAR DUE TO THE UPPER-LEVEL ANTICYCLONE
POSITIONED OVER THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN SEA...PER WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
AND CLOUD DRIFT WINDS FROM THE CIMSS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN.

THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL...ALONG WITH NOGAPS AND THE UK METEOROLOGICAL
OFFICE MODELS...SHOW THE HIGH OVER THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN DRIFTING
WESTWARD DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS.  ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM IS IN A
SHEARED...WEAKENED STATE AT THIS TIME THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF THE
TROPICAL WAVE LOCATED JUST EAST OF THE SYSTEM IS AN UNKNOWN.  IN
FACT...A BANDING FEATURE HAS DEVELOPED NORTH OF THE CENTER...NEAR
15N...AND EXTENDS SOUTHEAST FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES.  THE FORECAST
STILL SHOWS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE SYSTEM TO REACH TROPICAL STORM
STRENGTH BEFORE LANDFALL. 

THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK SHOWS A GENERAL NORTHWEST MOTION
THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD AND IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE 
12Z TRACK GUIDANCE ENSEMBLE.  THE NHC TRACK IS IN CLOSEST AGREEMENT
WITH THE UK MET OFFICE TRACK...AND BRINGS THE SYSTEM INLAND OVER
NORTHEASTERN NICARAGUA BETWEEN 12 AND 24 HOURS.  THE SYSTEM EMERGES
INTO THE GULF OF HONDURAS BY 48 HOURS AND MAY RE-INTENSIFY...WHICH 
IS WHAT THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS. HOWEVER...THERE IS CONSIDERABLE
UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST AS THE SYSTEM
COULD DISSIPATE OVER LAND.  

AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER RECONNAISSANCE MISSION IS 
SCHEDULED FOR THIS AFTERNOON. AFTER COORDINATION WITH THE
GOVERNMENTS OF NICARAGUA AND COLOMBIA THE TROPICAL STORM WARNING
SOUTH OF BLUEFIELDS AND FOR THE SAN ANDRES ISLANDS WILL BE

ALTHOUGH THE CENTER OF KATRINA REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE VISIBLE
SATELLITE PICTURES THIS MORNING SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER HAS MOVED
ON A MORE WESTERLY HEADING AND HAS SLOWED DOWN.  THE BEST ESTIMATE
OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 290/06 KNOTS.  THE OBJECTIVE TRACK MODEL
GUIDANCE REMAINS DIVERGENT WITH MOST SHOWING A WEST-NORTHWEST TRACK
WHICH KEEPS THE SYSTEM INLAND.  THE UKMET...WHICH HAS PERFORMED THE
BEST WITH THIS SYSTEM...TAKES KATRINA NORTHWESTWARD...THEN NORTH-
NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE YUCATAN AND INTO THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF
MEXICO IN RESPONSE TO THE CUTOFF LOW...CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL TEXAS
...LIFTING OUT INTO THE EASTERN UNITED STATES BY THE END OF THE
PERIOD. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO...BUT IS
SLIGHTLY LEFT AND A TAD SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY MAINLY 
DUE TO THE INITIAL MOTION.

THE DEEP CONVECTION REMAINS WEST OF THE CENTER...AND THE TOPS HAVE
BEEN WARMING DURING THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS.  THE SYSTEM IS STILL
EXPERIENCING EASTERLY SHEAR PER IR IMAGERY AND ANALYSES FROM CIMSS
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED 
TO 25 KNOTS. THE CURRENT TRACK KEEPS THE SYSTEM OVER LAND FOR THE
NEXT 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...IF THE DEPRESSION SURVIVES ITS TRAVERSE
OVER LAND...GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL CONDITIONS
WOULD SUPPORT SOME SLIGHT STRENGTHENING IN THE GULF OF HONDURAS.
THIS WOULD BE SHORT-LIVED HOWEVER AS THE CENTER WOULD MOVE INLAND 
OVER THE YUCATAN.  BEYOND 48 HOURS...THE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT
BECOMES HOSTILE DUE TO STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE GULF OF
MEXICO IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UPPER-LOW MENTIONED ABOVE. AGAIN...
ALL OF THIS IS CONTINGENT ON THE SYSTEM SURVIVING ITS TREK ACROSS 
THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF HONDURAS. 
 
THE PRIMARY THREAT WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO BE HEAVY
RAINFALL...FOR NICARAGUA...HONDURAS...AND EL SALVADOR.  THE
POTENTIAL FOR FLASH FLOODING AND MUDSLIDES...ESPECIALLY IN
MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN.  RAINBANDS NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION OVER THE
GULF OF HONDURAS ARE SPREADING INTO GUATEMALA...BELIZE AND THE
YUCATAN PENINSULA AND COULD PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS AND STRONG

THE CIRCULATION OF KATRINA IS BEING DISRUPTED BY THE MOUNTAINOUS
TERRAIN OF EASTERN HONDURAS AND CONSEQUENTLY...HAS BECOME VERY
DIFFUSE.  VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE CIRCULATION
HAS BECOME ELONGATED NORTH-NORTHEAST/SOUTH-SOUTHWEST AND IN FACT...
THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE CENTERS. AS A COMPROMISE...I HAVE CHOSEN 
TO USE A CENTRAL POINT ALONG THE AXIS AS THE CENTER.  USING THIS
POSITION...THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL MOTION IS 295/07 KNOTS.

AS WAS THE CASE EARLIER...MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK GUIDANCE
REMAINS DIVERGENT. THE UKMET...WHICH HAS PERFORMED WELL WITH THIS
SYSTEM...NOW DISSIPATES KATRINA BY 24 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
TRACK IS BASICALLY AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY AND KEEPS
THE SYSTEM OVER LAND FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS...MOVES IT INTO THE GULF
OF HONDURAS BY 24 HOURS...INLAND OVER THE YUCATAN 36 HOURS...WITH 
A 72 HOUR POINT OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. THIS TRACK IS
CONTINGENT ON THE SYSTEM SURVIVING ITS TREK ACROSS THE MOUNTAINOUS
TERRAIN OF HONDURAS. 

THERE IS NO LONGER ANY DEEP CONVECTION DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE CIRCULATION CENTER ALTHOUGH CONVECTION PERSISTS NEAR THE COAST
OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...BELIZE AND GUATEMALA.  THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS HELD AT 25 KNOTS. WHILE THE GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE 
THAT THE CONDITIONS COULD BECOME A BIT MORE FAVORABLE BY 24 HOURS
THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE LITTLE TIME TO RE-ORGANIZE. THEREAFTER...THE
UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT BECOMES INCREASING HOSTILE DUE TO STRONG
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO IN ASSOCIATION WITH
THE UPPER-LOW...CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL TEXAS...LIFTING OUT INTO 
THE SOUTHEAST/EASTERN U.S. BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. 

THE FORECAST CONTINUES A TRACK THROUGH 72 HOURS BUT THEIR IS
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINLY AS TO WHETHER THE DEPRESSION SURVIVES
THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS MUCH LESS 72. GIVEN THE SYSTEMS LOCATION 
AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT A CENTER COULD RE-LOCATE/RE-FORM OUT 
OVER THE GULF OF HONDURAS...WE WILL HOLD ON TO IT FOR NOW.  
 
THE PRIMARY THREAT CONTINUES TO BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL MAINLY IN
PORTIONS OF HONDURAS...GUATEMALA...BELIZE AND THE YUCATAN PENINSULA
WHERE RAINBANDS NORTH OF THE DEPRESSION ARE MOVING ONSHORE. THE
POTENTIAL FOR FLASH FLOODING AND MUDSLIDES CONTINUES..ESPECIALLY IN

KATRINA HAS PULLED A HALLOWEEN TRICK. SATELLITE IMAGERY AND SURFACE
OBSERVATIONS DURING THE AFTERNOON INDICATED THE CIRCULATION WAS
ELONGATED FROM THE SOUTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO SOUTHEASTWARD TO
NORTHERN NICARAGUA. OBSERVATIONS FROM LA CEIBA AND ROATAN IN
HONDURAS HAVE SHOWN PERSISTENT SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS...INDICATING THE
CENTER HAS RE-FORMED OF THE GULF OF HONDURAS. THIS REQUIRES A RE-
LOCATION FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.
 
WITH THE REFORMATION...THE INITIAL MOTION IS AT BEST A GUESS AND IS
SET TO 305/9. THE HURRICANE GUIDANCE REMAINS DIVERGENT...WITH THE
BAMS TAKING KATRINA TO THE PACIFIC IN 72 HOURS AND THE BAMD TAKING
IT TO THE FLORIDA KEYS. THE DEEP LAYER LOW OVER THE WESTERN GULF
STATES IS FORECAST TO MOVE EAST BY ALL LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE...AND
THIS SHOULD RECURVE KATRINA TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST. THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST REFLECT THIS...AND IS SHIFTED NORTH AND EAST OF THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST. LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THE 72 HOUR POINT
MAY NOT BE FAR ENOUGH EAST...BUT THERE IS ALREADY SO A LARGE CHANGE
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY THAT I AM RELUCTANT TO CHANGE IT FURTHER.
 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 30 KT AND 25 KT
RESPECTIVELY...WITH THE CENTRAL CONVECTION RATHER POORLY ORGANIZED.
THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 25 KT. SINCE SOME EASTERLY
SHEAR REMAINS...ONLY MODEST STRENGTHENING IS FORECAST BEFORE THE
CENTER MOVES OVER THE YUCATAN PENINSULA. AFTER THAT...THE FORECAST
IS COMPLEX. THE AVN AND NOGAPS MODELS DEVELOP A LOW OVER THE
NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO THAT APPEARS RELATED TO THE DEEP LAYER
TROUGH. SHOULD THIS VERIFY...IT WOULD LIKELY ABSORB KATRINA. THE
CYCLONE COULD ALSO BECOME EXTRATROPICAL AND BECOME THE FOCUS OF THE
DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF. THERE IS ALSO AN OUTSIDE CHANCE
THAT KATRINA COULD REGAIN TROPICAL STORM STATUS AS IT LEAVES THE
YUCATAN PENINSULA. THE LOW CONFIDENCE INTENSITY FORECAST IS FOR
KATRINA TO SURVIVE AS A 30 KT DEPRESSION THROUGH 72 HOURS.
 
A SPECIAL THANKS GOES TO THE METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE OF HONDURAS FOR
SENDING VALUABLE OBSERVATIONS VIA FAX AFTER NORMAL COMMUNICATIONS
HAD BROKEN DOWN.

THE CENTER REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE IN THE INFRARED SATELLITE
IMAGERY BUT SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM BELIZE AND MEXICO SUGGEST THAT
THE SYSTEM IS NOW OVER THE YUCATAN PENINSULA.  THE LATEST 0600 UTC
POSITION INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM IS MOVING MUCH FASTER AND THIS
MAY BE A RESULT OF THE RELOCATION PROCESS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.  THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW INCREASED TO 340/15.  WITH THIS
FASTER INITIAL MOTION THE MODEL GUIDANCE GENERALLY MOVES THE SYSTEM
FASTER TO THE NORTH AND EAST.  A NOTABLE EXCEPTION IS THE BAMS WHICH
TAKES THE SYSTEM SOUTHWESTWARD INTO THE EASTERN PACIFIC.  ALSO THE
UKMET WANTS TO DISSIPATE THE SYSTEM OVER THE YUCATAN AFTER 24 HOURS.
THE VARIOUS MODELS SUGGEST LANDFALLS ANYWHERE IN FLORIDA FROM THE
PANHANDLE TO THE FLORIDA KEYS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO
THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE BUT...OF COURSE...MUCH FASTER.  IF THE CURRENT
FORECAST COMES TO FRUITION THAN A TROPICAL STORM WATCH MAY BE
REQUIRED EITHER LATER TODAY OR EARLY TOMORROW FOR SOME PORTION OF
THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA.  
 
SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES STILL SUGGEST THAT KATRINA IS A WEAK
DEPRESSION WITH 25 KNOTS.  THE SYSTEM REMAINS POORLY ORGANIZED.
IN LIGHT OF THE FASTER FORWARD MOTION THE SYSTEM WILL EMERGE INTO
THE GULF OF MEXICO IN THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS AND MODEST
STRENGTHENING SHOULD BEGIN AS PER THE SHIPS FORECAST.  THE SYSTEM IS
FORECAST TO BE A MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM BRFORE IT MERGES WITH THE

SATELLITE IMAGERY AND LIMITED SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA SUGGESTS THAT THE ILL-DEFINED CENTER OF KATRINA IS OVER
THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE PENINSULA.  THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE
INITIAL MOTION IS 345/09 KNOTS.  

THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS HELD AT 25 KNOTS. GRADUAL STRENGTHENING 
IS INDICATED THROUGH 36 HOURS AS THE SYSTEM EMERGES INTO THE CENTRAL
GULF OF MEXICO ALTHOUGH THIS IS HIGHLY DEPENDANT ON THE TRACK. THE
INTENSITY FORECAST FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY HAS BEEN MAINTAINED
DUE TO THE UNCERTAINLY IN THE FORECAST TRACK. THE BEST CHANCE FOR

A MORE EASTERLY TRACK WHERE A MORE FAVORABLE SHEAR ENVIRONMENT IS
LIKELY TO EXISTS. KATRINA IS FORECAST BECOME EXTRATROPICAL BY 72

VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW THAT THE CENTER OF KATRINA HAS
BECOME A LITTLE BETTER DEFINED DURING THE DAY. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS
COUPLED WITH VISIBLE SATELLITE POSITION ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THE
CENTER OF KATRINA IS OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL PORTION OF THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA.  THIS REPRESENTS A SLIGHT WESTWARD ADJUSTMENT FROM THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  WEAK SYSTEMS LIKE THIS CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO
TRACK...ESPECIALLY OVER LAND.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS NOW
325/08 KT.
 
ANALYSIS OF UPPER-AIR DATA OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN AND THE GULF
OF MEXICO SHOWS A MID-LEVEL HIGH NEAR EASTERN/CENTRAL CUBA WITH A
RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING ALONG 22N/23N.  KATRINA HAS CONTINUED TO MOVE
NORTHWEST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS FEATURE AND SHOULD BEGIN TO
TURN NORTH...THEN NORTH-NORTHEAST MONDAY AS IT PASSES NORTH OF THE 
AXIS. THE SYSTEM SHOULD BEGIN TO ACCELERATE TO THE NORTHEAST LATE
MONDAY/TUESDAY IN RESPONSE TO THE DEEP-LAYER TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER
EASTERN TEXAS SHIFTING EASTWARD INTO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THIS SCENARIO AND IS SLIGHTLY SLOWER
AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.  WITH THE AVIATION MODEL
RUNNING LATE TODAY...THERE WAS LITTLE TRACK GUIDANCE AVAILABLE FROM
12Z MODELS RUNS. 

THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 25 KT.  THE FORECAST BRINGS KATRINA
TO MINIMAL TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH BY 24 HOURS AND MAINTAINS THAT
INTENSITY THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. AFTER 36 HOURS...THE
QUESTION IS WHETHER KATRINA MAINTAINS ITS IDENTITY OR IS ABSORBED BY

THE CIRCULATION IS BECOMING DIFFUSE AND THE CENTER IS HARD TO
IDENTIFY...EVEN ON HIGH-RESOLUTION VISIBLE IMAGES.  KATRINA IS BEING
ABSORBED INTO THE COLD FRONT THAT IS MOVING INTO THE YUCATAN
PENINSULA.  THIS IS CAUSING THE TROPICAL CYCLONE TO DISSIPATE.  THE
COMBINATION OF DRY STABLE AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT AND STRONG
UPPER-LEVEL WINDS SHOULD PRECLUDE REDEVELOPMENT.  

INITIAL MOTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AS BEFORE.  THE
TRACK FORECAST IS ALSO SIMILAR...HOWEVER SINCE THE CENTER IS
BECOMING DIFFICULT TO FIND RIGHT NOW...NO POSITIONS ARE GIVEN BEYOND
24 HOURS.

MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH KATRINAS REMNANTS AND A MOIST TROPICAL FLOW
FROM THE CARIBBEAN INTO THE EASTERN GULF...COMBINED WITH THE FRONTAL
ZONE...STILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS OVER

A US AIR FORCE RESERVE UNIT HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATED
THE BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA IN THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN THIS
AFTERNOON AND REPORTED A NOT-TOO-WELL-DEFINED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION
CENTER.  DEPRESSION ADVISORIES ARE INITIATED ON THE BASIS OF THIS
INFORMATION.  SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW PLENTY OF DEEP
CONVECTION...BUT NOT WELL ORGANIZED...SO THERE ARE NO FAST CHANGES
TAKING PLACE AT THIS TIME.  THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS FOR LITTLE
CHANGE TO THE 30 KNOT MAX ONE-MIN WINDS EXCEPT AT 72 HOURS WHEN SOME
OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES A POTENTIAL FOR STRENGTHENING.
 
THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 170/05.  ALMOST ALL OF THE MODELS
SHOW A TURN TOWARD THE EAST AS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVES ACROSS
NORTH AMERICA TO THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC IN 3 DAYS...GREATLY
AMPLIFYING THE LONG WAVE TROUGH.  THIS EXTENDS THE WESTERLIES SOUTH
TO THE DEPRESSION WHICH IS FORECAST TO RESPOND WITH AN EASTWARD
MOTION.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE AND IS
CLOSE TO THE UKMET...GFDL...AND NAVY NOGAPS MODELS.

THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL IS LOCATED NEAR THE CAYMAN ISLANDS...NEAR AND
SOUTH OF EASTERN CUBA...AND JUST WEST OF JAMAICA.

10 PM EST SAT NOV 13 1999

THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPRESSION HAS IMPROVED SLIGHTLY
THIS EVENING.  SINCE THE CYCLONE IS FORECAST TO MOVE GENERALLY
EASTWARD INTO AN AREA OF SLIGHTLY DECREASED VERTICAL SHEAR...AS
SUGGESTED BY WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN CIMSS...THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF STRENGTHENING.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST MAKES THE SYSTEM A TROPICAL STORM BY 24 HOURS. 
THIS COULD HAPPEN SOONER IF THE CURRENT ORGANIZING TREND IS
MAINTAINED.

SATELLITE FIXES HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE BUT MULTI-CHANNEL INFRARED
IMAGERY...WHICH ENHANCES LOW CLOUDS...SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER IS NOW
HEADED TOWARD THE SOUTHEAST.  A LARGE AND VIGOROUS MID-TROPOSPHERIC
VORTICITY MAXIMUM...CURRENTLY MOVING FROM CANADA TO THE GREAT
LAKES...IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST IN 1-2 DAYS AND
STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  THE
ASSOCIATED WESTERLY STEERING FLOW SHOULD CARRY THE TROPICAL CYCLONE
ON A GENERALLY EASTWARD TO EAST-NORTHEASTWARD TRACK DURING THE
PERIOD.  THE CURRENT OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALONG A TRAJECTORY SIMILAR
TO THE PREVIOUS ONE...BUT SOMEWHAT FASTER IN THE FIRST PART OF THE
PERIOD BECAUSE OF A FASTER ESTIMATED INITIAL MOTION...8 KNOTS.

WHILE THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE HAS NOT
CHANGED APPRECIABLY OVERNIGHT...THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TREND HAS
BEEN THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE CENTER WITH THE DEEP CONVECTION
ALTHOUGH THE COLDEST TOPS...TO -80C...REMAIN NORTH.  HOWEVER...
TWO SHIP OBSERVATIONS..PCBZ AND ELUR3...NEAR THE CENTER SHOW WINDS
OF 12 AND 13 KT...RESPECTIVELY.  THUS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY WILL
BE HELD AT 30 KT FOR THIS ADVISORY. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST MAKES 
THE SYSTEM A TROPICAL STORM WITHIN 12 HOURS.
 
WHILE SATELLITE FIXES STILL SHOW SOME SCATTER...NOT UNUSUAL FOR
WEAK SYSTEMS USING IR IMAGERY...THE TWO SHIP OBSERVATIONS MENTIONED
ABOVE HELP PINPOINT THE CENTER. THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL
MOTION IS NOW 095/08 KT.  THERE IS NO CHANGE WITH REGARDS TO THE
SYNOPTIC REASONING BEHIND THE TRACK FORECAST AS A STRONG U.S. MID-
TROPOSPHERIC SHORTWAVE/LOW...ENTERING THE GREAT LAKES REGION AT
THIS TIME...IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST DURING THE
NEXT 24-36 HOURS AND RE-ENFORCE THE EXISTING TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC.  THE ASSOCIATED WESTERLY STEERING FLOW SHOULD MOVE THE
TROPICAL CYCLONE ON A GENERALLY EASTWARD TO EAST-NORTHEASTWARD
TRACK DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE AND IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
UK METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE MODEL.
 
BASED ON THE CURRENT FORECAST TRACK...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY ALONG
WITH ANALYSES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN CIMSS INDICATE THAT
THE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO AN AREA OF SLIGHTLY DECREASED VERTICAL
WIND SHEAR THEREBY ALLOWING FOR SOME STRENGTHENING. AN AIR FORCE

DIFFICULT TO LOCATE ON EARLY VISIBLE IMAGERY.  THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS 100/07 AND THE TRACK SCENARIO REMAINS THE SAME AS IN THE

SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE AT TROPICAL STORM FORCE BUT THERE
HAVE BEEN NO SHIP OR ISLAND REPORTS TO CONFIRM THIS.  AN AIRCRAFT IS
SCHEDULED TO INVESTIGATE THIS AFTERNOON AND I WILL DELAY UPGRADING

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
10 PM EST SUN NOV 14 1999

SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE IN THE CLOUD PATTERN OVER THE
PAST FEW HOURS...SO THE INTENSITY APPEARS TO HAVE LEVELLED OFF FOR
THE TIME BEING.  A BURST OF CONVECTION OVER THE CENTER HAS OBSCURED
THE EYE ON THE INFRARED IMAGERY.  HOWEVER AN EYE WITH A DIAMETER OF
15-20 N MI WAS EVIDENT ON A RECENT SSM/I PASS OVER THE HURRICANE.
CURRENT INTENSITY IS HELD AT 70 KNOTS...IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH
DVORAK T-NUMBERS.  ANOTHER HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO
PROVIDE A POSITION AND INTENSITY ESTIMATE AROUND 0600 UTC.

OBVIOUSLY...THE RAPID INTENSIFICATION OF THIS TROPICAL CYCLONE WAS
NOT ANTICIPATED.  THIS AGAIN UNDERSCORES OUR LIMITED ABILITY TO
PREDICT INTENSITY CHANGE.  LENNY IS DEVELOPING A FAIR UPPER-LEVEL
OUTFLOW ANTICYCLONE AND...PRESUMING THAT VERTICAL SHEAR DOES NOT
INCREASE TOO MUCH DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS... ADDITIONAL
STRENGTHENING IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.  THIS IS INDICATED IN THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE CENTER HAS SLIPPED A LITTLE TO THE SOUTH BUT MOTION IS ESTIMATED
TO BE GENERALLY EASTWARD AT A SLIGHTLY FASTER FORWARD SPEED...7
KNOTS.  LENNY IS EXPECTED TO BE STEERED BY THE FLOW ON THE SOUTH
SIDE OF A DEEP-LAYER TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.  CURRENT
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A REINFORCING VORTICITY MAX MOVING OFF THE
U.S. EAST COAST...AND THE 18Z NCEP GLOBAL MODEL RUN SHOWS ADDITIONAL
VORTICITY ENTERING THE TROUGH DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS
SHOULD PRODUCE SOME AMPLIFICATION OF THE TROUGH AND AN INCREASED
WESTERLY STEERING FLOW FOR LENNY.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST SHOWS A
GRADUAL INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED AND A TURN TOWARD THE EAST-
NORTHEAST...IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE U.K. MET. OFFICE AND GFDL
MODELS.  THIS IS ALSO VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS OFFICIAL TRACK
FORECAST.

LENNY IS STRENGTHENING RATHER QUICKLY THIS MORNING. REPORTS FROM AN
AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER INDICATE THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS
DROPPED TO 971 MB...WITH MAXIMUM 850 MB WINDS OF 100 KT. AN EYE
APPEARS INTERMITTENTLY ON INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND SATELLITE
INTENSITY ESTIMATES FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA ARE ALL 77 KT. BASED
ON THE AIRCRAFT DATA...THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE RAISED TO 85 KT FOR
THIS PACKAGE. DESPITE THE INTENSIFICATION...THE WIND RADII REMAIN
RATHER SMALL.
 
LENNY MOVED EAST-SOUTHEAST DURING THE EVENING. HOWEVER...THE LATEST
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A MORE EASTWARD MOTION AND THE INITIAL
MOTION FOR THIS ADVISORY IS 095/8. A LARGE LONGWAVE TROUGH DOMINATES
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...AND THIS SHOULD KEEP LENNY ON A GENERALLY
EASTWARD TRACK FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS. LARGE SCALE MODELS
SUGGESTS THAT A MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL DEVELOP EAST OF THE
LESSER ANTILLES AFTER 36 HOURS...WHICH SHOULD TURN LENNY MORE TO THE
NORTHEAST. THE AMOUNT OF TURN...HOWEVER...IS UNCERTAIN. THE MEAN
POSITION OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH IN THE MODELS IS ABOUT THE SAME
LONGITUDE AS THE HURRICANE...WHICH WOULD SUPPORT A MORE EASTWARD
MOTION. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE NOGAPS. ON THE OTHER HAND...MOST
OTHER GUIDANCE TURNS THE STORM MORE SHARPLY TO THE NORTHEAST. THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE POSITIONS AND IS
ALONG THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE NHC HURRICANE GUIDANCE ENVELOPE.
 
AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OR ANTICYCLONE REMAINS OVER LENNY...SO FURTHER
INTENSIFICATION APPEARS LIKELY. THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS HOW LONG
WILL THE CURRENT RAPID STRENGTHENING CONTINUE? THE INTENSITY
FORECAST CALLS FOR FURTHER STRENGTHENING FOR 24 HOURS FOLLOWED BY A
LEVELING OUT. ALTHOUGH MAJOR NOVEMBER HURRICANES ARE NOT UNHEARD
OF...THEY ARE UNCOMMON ENOUGH THAT I WILL NOT FORECAST LENNY TO
BECOME ONE JUST YET.

BASED ON A RECENT AIRCRAFT FIX...THE INITIAL MOTION IS 095/13.  THIS
IS A LITLE FASTER THAN BEFORE AND THE SATELLITE FIXES GIVE A MOTION
CLOSER TO 10 KNOTS.  THE REASONING FOR THE FORECAST TRACK IS
UNCHANGED.  A DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC IS
EXPECTED TO MOVE THE HURRICANE MOSTLY EASTWARD AND THEN
NORTHEASTWARD FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  SOME OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES
THAT THE FORWARD MOTION MAY SLOW A LITTLE AFTER 48 HOURS AS THE
SHORT WAVE MOVES AWAY WITHOUT TOTALLY PICKING UP THE HURRICANE.  THE
OFFICIAL FORECAST IS THEREFORE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY AFTER 48 HOURS...OTHERWISE THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE
TRACK FORECAST.
 
THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS RISEN FROM 971 TO 981 IN 12 HOURS AND THE
MAXIMUM WIND MEASURED BY RECON IS 73 KNOTS FROM A GPS DROP IN THE
SOUTHWEST QUADRANT.  THE WIND SPEED IS DECREASED TO 75 KNOTS ON THIS
BASIS.  THE SHIPS MODEL FORECASTS 15 KNOTS OF STRENGTHENING IN

THERE IS NO EYE EVIDENT EITHER ON MICROWAVE OR INFRARED IMAGERY AND
THE OVERALL CLOUD PATTERN...EVEN THOUGH IT CONTAINS CONSIDERABLE AND
VERY DEEP CONVECTION...IS NOT THAT WELL ORGANIZED.  EARLIER RECON
DATA IMPLIED CONSIDERABLE WEAKENING AND CURRENT DVORAK DATA T-
NUMBERS ARE ALSO DOWN FROM WHERE THEY WERE EARLIER TODAY.  CURRENT
INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 70 KNOTS.  WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY LENNY
WEAKENED TODAY...EXCEPT THAT ITS VERY SMALL INNER CORE REGION MAY BE
VERY SENSITIVE TO SUBTLE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES.  DROPSONDE DATA FROM
THE NOAA G-IV JET MISSION THIS EVENING SHOW A FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC OUTFLOW PATTERN BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE CONFINED TO
A SHALLOWER LAYER...AROUND 200 MB...THAN WE NORMALLY SEE.  BOTH THE
SHIPS AND THE TRIPLY-NESTED GFDL MODEL INDICATE THAT SOME RE-
STRENGTHENING COULD OCCUR...AND THIS IS ALLOWED FOR IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST.

CENTER FIXES ARE RATHER UNCERTAIN...BUT USING A BLEND OF INFRARED
AND MICROWAVE-BASED POSITION ESTIMATES...INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
080/12.  THE OFFICIAL TRACK FORECAST IS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ONE.  LENNY IS LIKELY TO BE STEERED BY THE FLOW AROUND THE
SOUTHERN PORTION OF A DEEP-LAYER TROUGH.  WIND DATA FROM THE G-IV
SUPPORT THIS SCENARIO AS WELL.  THE NCEP GLOBAL MODEL SHOWS SOME
AMPLIFICATION OF A MID-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE TO THE EAST OF THE
LEEWARD ISLAND IN 2-3 DAYS.  THIS SHOULD CAUSE A MORE NORTHEASTWARD
TRACK IN THE LATTER PART OF THE PERIOD.

SINCE THE FORECAST TRACK AND WIND RADII BRING TROPICAL STORM FORCE
WINDS TO PUERTO RICO IN 24 HOURS...IT IS PRUDENT TO ISSUE HURRICANE
WARNINGS FOR THAT AREA AT THIS TIME.  THE SLIGHTLY LARGER EXTENT OF
34-KNOT WINDS TO THE NORTH SHOWN ON THIS ADVISORY ALSO NECESSITATES
THE ISSUANCE OF A TROPICAL STORM WARNING FOR THE SOUTH COAST OF THE

HURRICANE LENNY DISCUSSION NUMBER  12
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST TUE NOV 16 1999
 
HERE WE GO AGAIN! REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT INDICATE LENNY IS STRENGTHENING WITH A MINIMUM CENTRAL
PRESSURE OF 971 MB AND MAXIMUM 850 MB WINDS OF 109 KT. THE PLANE
ALSO REPORTED A 45 NM WIDE EYE. ALTHOUGH NO EYE IS VISIBLE IN
SATELLITE IMAGERY...THE CLOUD TOPS NEAR THE CENTER ARE -80C TO -85C
AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE AS HIGH AS 102 KT. THE INITIAL
INTENSITY IS SET TO 85 KT...AND THIS MAY BE A BIT CONSERVATIVE.

THE INITIAL MOTION IS 085/13...ALTHOUGH THE TWO AIRCRAFT FIXES HINT
AT A POSSIBLE FASTER MOTION OF 15-16 KT. THE ENVIRONMENT IS LITTLE
CHANGED FROM 24 HOURS AGO...WITH A LARGE DEEP LAYER TROUGH NORTH OF
THE HURRICANE. LARGE SCALE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A RIDGE SHOULD BUILD
EAST OF THE LESSER ANTILLES...WHICH SHOULD TURN LENNY TO A
NORTHEASTWARD TRACK IN THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS. ALL MODEL FORECASTS ARE
CLUSTERED AROUND A TRACK THROUGH PUERTO RICO AND/OR THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS...WITH THE ONLY DIFFERENCES BEING IN HOW FAST LENNY MOVES.
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE. IT IS
NOTABLE THAT IF LENNY DOES NOT TURN SOON...THE FORECAST MAY NEED TO
BE ADJUSTED EASTWARD...INCREASING THE THREAT TO THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.
AFTER PASSAGE THROUGH THE ISLANDS...THE NOGAPS AND ECMWF MODELS
BUILD A SHORTWAVE RIDGE NORTH OF LENNY WHICH COULD SLOW THE SYSTEM
DOWN. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.

THE FIRST PART OF THE INTENSITY FORECAST IS TRICKY. WITH THE COLD
TOPS AND GENERALLY FAVORABLE OUTFLOW...IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LENNY
COULD BECOME A MAJOR HURRICANE LATER TODAY. ON THE OTHER HAND...THE
RAPID INTENSIFICATION SEEN LAST NIGHT STOPPED RATHER ABRUPTLY DURING
THE DAY. THE INTENSITY FORECAST COMPROMISES BETWEEN THESE TWO
EXTREMES AND TAKES LENNY ACROSS PUERTO RICO AT 95 KT. THINGS ARE
SIMPLER AFTER PASSAGE THROUGH THE ISLANDS...AS A COMBINATION OF
COOLER WATER AND INCREASING VERTICAL SHEAR SHOULD WEAKEN THE
HURRICANE.

10 AM EST TUE NOV 16 1999

LENNY REMAINS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE WESTERLIES AND CONSEQUENTLY IS
STILL MOVING TOWARD THE EAST ABOUT 14 KNOTS.  A RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
AMPLIFY TO THE EAST OF THE HURRICANE PROVIDING A PATTERN WHICH WOULD
FAVOR A TRACK MORE TO THE NORTHEAST.  IN FACT...THIS IS THE SOLUTION
INDICATED BY MOST OF THE MODELS...WITH SOME SUGGESTING A DECREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED.  ALTHOUGH THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK HAS BEEN
ADJUSTED A LITTLE TO THE EAST DUE TO THE INITIAL MOTION AND WATCHES
AND WARNINGS HAVE BEEN EXTENDED EASTWARD...THE HURRICANE WARNING FOR
PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS MUST CONTINUE BECAUSE RELIABLE
UK...GFDL AND GFDN MODELS BRING THE HURRICANE OVER PUERTO RICO.  

A NOAA P3 PLANE HAS BEEN FLYING AND HAS RECENTLY REPORTED A MINIMUM
PRESSURE OF 973 MB WITH WINDS OF 96 KNOTS AT FLIGHT LEVEL. SINCE THE
OUTFLOW REMAINS FAIR AND THERE IS NO SHEAR IN THE NEAR FUTURE...THE
INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR SOME STRENGTHENING DURING THE NEXT 24
HOUR OR SO...AS INDICATED IN THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

4 PM EST TUE NOV 16 1999
 
FIXES FROM RECONNAISSANCE PLANES AND SATELLITE INDICATE THAT LENNY
IS MOVING ABOUT 070/15 KNOTS.  GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A RIDGE TO THE EAST OF THE HURRICANE.  THIS WOULD
RESULT ON A CONTINUED EAST-NORTHEAST TRACK AND THEN NORTHEAST AROUND
THE DEVELOPING RIDGE DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.  THIS IS THE
SOLUTION INDICATED BY MOST OF THE MODELS...WITH SOME SUGGESTING A
DECREASE IN FORWARD SPEED.  IN FACT...THE NAVY NOGAPS MODEL
FORECASTS THE HURRICANE TO MOVE ON A SLOW NORTHEAST TO NORTH TRACK
OVER PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.   IF THIS MATERIALIZES...IT
COULD RESULT IN EVEN WORSE CONDITIONS FOR THE AREA UNDER WARNING. 
ALL PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE COMPLETED SOON AGAINST THIS DANGEROUS
HURRICANE.  

SINCE THE HURRICANE IS COMING FROM THE SOUTHWEST...MARINE INTERESTS
SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THE STRONGEST WINDS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE SOUTH
AND WEST FACING UNPROTECTED HARBORS.  KLAUS IN NOVEMBER 1984
PRODUCED CONSIDERABLE MARINE DAMAGE TO THIS AREA AND IT WAS ONLY A
TROPICAL STORM.
 
SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT THIS IS A WELL ORGANIZED HURRICANE
WITH EXCELLENT BANDING FEATURES...AN INTERMITTENT EYE AND GOOD
OUTFLOW.  DROPSONDES MEASURED 965 MB PRESSURE IN THE EYE...MEAN
BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS OF 107 KNOTS...AND MEASURED 96 KNOTS AT THE
SURFACE.  THE EXTRAPOLATED PRESSURE FROM 700 MB WAS 960 MB WITH PEAK
WINDS OF 112 KNOTS. INITIAL INTENSITY HAS BEN ADJUSTED TO 100 KNOTS.
THIS MAKES LENNY A DANGEROUS CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR
SIMPSON SCALE...THE FIFTH MAJOR HURRICANE OF THE SEASON. 
 
THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOUR OR SO.
 
A CIRCULAR EYE IS BEGINNING TO APPEAR ON SAN JUAN DOPPLER RADAR.

A FEW HOURS AGO...A GPS DROPSONDE MEASURED A WIND SPEED OF 126 KNOTS
AT 907 MB IN THE SOUTHEAST EYEWALL.  THE MEAN BOUNDARY LAYER WIND
WAS 101 KNOTS.  A CENTER FIX BY THE NEW WC-130 MODEL J HURRICANE
HUNTER AIRCRAFT SHOWED A CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 958 MB AT 0029Z...
INDICATING A LITTLE MORE DEEPENING.  THE PRESENTATION ON THE SAN
JUAN WSR-88D RADAR IS BECOMING BETTER DEFINED WITH A 25 N MI
DIAMETER EYE SURROUNDED BY A CLOSED WALL.  THE RADAR ALSO MEASURED
CLOUD TOPS TO 60000 FEET IN AN OUTER RAINBAND ABOUT 90 N MI SOUTH OF
THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF PUERTO RICO.  THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY
OF ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING OF LENNY WITHIN THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS
SINCE VERTICAL SHEAR REMAINS FAIRLY WEAK.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
MERELY HOLDS THE WINDS STEADY BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES IN
INTENSITY PREDICTION.  LATER IN THE PERIOD...WEAKENING IS EXPECTED
DUE TO AN INCREASINGLY UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT.
 
THE EXPECTED NORTHEASTWARD TURN HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET.  INITIAL
MOTION IS 070/14.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST TRACK IS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY
EAST ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONTINUED EAST-NORTHEASTWARD MOTION OVER THE
PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  MOST OF THE MODELS STILL INDICATE A MORE
NORTHEASTWARD MOTION WITHIN 12 TO 24 HOURS...AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST IS ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GUIDANCE ENSEMBLE.  SINCE
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DEEP-LAYER TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO DE-AMPLIFY
DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...SOME SLOWING OF THE FORWARD SPEED
IS FORECAST.
 
DANGEROUS WINDS EXTEND MUCH FARTHER TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE
CENTER THAN TO THE NORTHWEST.  THE HURRICANE WARNING IS EXTENDED
EASTWARD AND SOUTHWARD TO INCLUDE ANTIGUA...BARBUDA AND MONTSERRAT.
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.

HURRICANE LENNY DISCUSSION NUMBER  16
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 AM EST WED NOV 17 1999
 
REPORTS FROM AN AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATE
LENNY CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN. THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS DROPPED TO
950 MB WITH MAXIMUM 700 MB WINDS OF 120 KT IN THE SOUTHEAST
QUADRANT. A SOUTHEAST EYEWALL DROPSONDE HAD 132 KT WINDS AT 924 MB
AND 110 KT JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE. AN EYE IS BECOMING APPARENT IN
INFRARED IMAGERY...AND THE SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES ARE 127
KT...115 KT...AND 102 KT FROM TAFB...SAB...AND AFWA RESPECTIVELY.
BASED ON THIS...THE MAXIMUM WINDS ARE INCREASED TO 110 KT ON THIS
PACKAGE.

LENNY MAY BE STARTING ITS NORTHEASTWARD TURN. THE 12 HOUR AND
ADVISORY MOTION IS 065/12...AND A SHORTER TERM MOTION IS MORE
NORTHEASTERLY. WATER VAPOR AND INFRARED IMAGERY INDICATES A RIDGE IS
STARTING TO DEVELOP EAST OF LENNY...WHICH SHOULD EVENTUALLY NUDGE
LENNY ONTO A NORTHEAST TRACK. THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS THE FORWARD
MOTION. THE ECMWF AND NOGAPS MODELS SLOW LENNY BEFORE THE STORM
REACHES THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS. THE AVN...UKMET...AND HURRICANE
GUIDANCE ARE MORE PROGRESSIVE...SLOWING THE STORM AFTER IT MOVES
INTO THE OPEN ATLANTIC. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST FOLLOWS THE LATTER
SOLUTION...AS THERE IS NO OBVIOUS REASON LENNY SHOULD STALL BEFORE
REACHING THE ISLANDS.
 
LENNY CONTINUES TO HAVE GOOD OUTFLOW IN ALL QUADRANTS EXCEPT THE
WEST...ALONG WITH VERY COLD CLOUD TOPS. SOME FURTHER STRENGTHENING
IS POSSIBLE TODAY. AFTER THE HURRICANE PASSES THROUGH THE
ISLANDS...A COMBINATION OF COOLER WATER AND INCREASING VERTICAL
SHEAR SHOULD CAUSE CONSIDERABLE WEAKENING.
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.

LENNY IS NOW A DANGEROUS CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR
/SIMPSON HURRICANE SCALE...THE FIFTH OF THE SEASON.  THIS IS
BASED ON A DROPSONDE IN THE EYEWALL WHICH MEASURED MEAN BOUNDARY
LAYER WINDS OF 118 KNOTS...REPORTS FROM A PLANE OF A MAXIMUM WIND OF
134 KNOTS AT 700 MB AND A MINIMUM MEASURED PRESSURE OF 948 MB AND A
LATER EXTRAPOLATED 942 MB.  SUBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS ARE BETWEEN 6.0 AND
6.5 ON THE DVORAK SCALE WITH A PEAK 7.0 RAW OBJECTIVE T-NUMBER. 
SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY ARE LIKELY DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36
HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A GRADUAL WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS LENNY MOVES
INTO A LESS FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT.
 
LENNY HAS SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE AND THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE INITIAL
MOTION IS 055/10.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UNLIKELY SOLUTION OF
NOGAPS...WHICH TURNS LENNY NORTHWARD TODAY...THE REMAINDER OF THE
MODELS AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT...TAKING
LENNY SLOWLY TOWARD THE NORTHEAST OVER THE NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN
ISLANDS.  THIS MOTION WAS EXPECTED BECAUSE GLOBAL MODELS HAVE BEEN
DEVELOPING A RIDGE TO THE EAST OF THE LENNY.  IN SUMMARY...THERE HAS
BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE STEERING PATTERN CONTROLLING THE PATH OF THE
HURRICANE. 
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.  
 
IF THE NORTHEASTWARD TREND CONTINUES DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS AND
THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK...THE WARNINGS FOR
MAINLAND PUERTO RICO..BUT NOT FOR CULEBRA AND VIEQUES WILL LIKELY BE
DOWNGRADED.

LENNY CONTINUES TO MOVE ON A GENERAL NORTHEASTWARD TRACK ABOUT 8
KNOTS.  BECAUSE THE STEERING CURRENTS CONTROLLING THE PATH OF THE
HURRICANE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE...THIS GENERAL NORTHEASTWARD
MOTION IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE THROUGH 72 HOURS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT
WITH MOST THE TRACK AND GLOBAL MODELS AND PREVIOUS FORECASTS.
 
THE SIGNIFICANT EVENT OF THE DAY IS THE UNEXPECTED INTENSIFICATION
OF LENNY...INDICATING THAT THERE IS LITTLE SKILL IN FORECASTING
RAPID INTENSITY CHANGES.  THE CENTRAL PRESSURE EXTRAPOLATED FROM 700
MB HAS FALLEN TO 927 MB WHILE A DROP MEASURED 934 MB.  THE 
FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS HAVE INCREASED TO 149 KNOTS.  THE MEAN BOUNDARY
LAYER WINDS FROM DROPSONDES ARE 155 KNOTS AND PEAK WINDS REACHED 180
KNOTS AT THE 891-MB LEVEL A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.  BASED ON THAT
INFORMATION...INITIAL INTENSITY WAS ADJUSTED TO 130 KNOTS.
LENNY IS VERY CLOSE TO BEING A CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE ON THE
SAFFIR/SIMPSON SCALE.  HURRICANES NORMALLY DO NOT STAY WITH SUCH
STRENGTH FOR A LONG TIME...THEREFORE SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY
ARE ANTICIPATED DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS.  THEREAFTER...A
GRADUAL WEAKENING IS EXPECTED AS LENNY MOVES INTO A LESS FAVORABLE
UPPER-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT.
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.
 
BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUED EASTWARD MOTION...THE HURRICANE WARNING FOR
MAINLAND PUERTO RICO HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO TROPICAL STORM WARNING

...CORRECTION PARAGRAPH 1...
 
THE LAST SEVERAL FIXES FROM U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE HUNTER
AIRCRAFT EARLIER THIS EVENING INDICATED THAT LENNY HAS BEEN DRIFTING
EAST-NORTHEASTWARD. IN FACT...THE HURRICANE HAS MOVED LITTLE DURING
THE LAST TWO HOURS.  THIS IS CONFIRMED BY NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
DOPPLER RADAR DATA OUT OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO. THE INITIAL MOTION
ESTIMATE IS QUASI-STATIONARY.
 
THE LATEST DATA RELAYED FROM THE RECON AIRCRAFT INDICATES THAT THE
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE IS NOW 939 MB...UP 5 MB OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL HOURS.  THE HIGHEST FLIGHT-LEVEL WINDS FOUND ON THE MOST
RECENT PASSES IS 128 KT.  THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 125 KT
FOR THIS ADVISORY.
 
ANALYSIS OF UPPER AIR DATA FROM THE NORTHEAST CARIBBEAN SHOWS THAT
LENNY IS IN A COL POINT BETWEEN THE TWO MID-TROPOSPHERIC HIGHS. A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH THE EASTERN/SOUTHEASTERN
U.S. IS EXPECTED TO MOVE EASTWARD INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC DURING
THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS.  THIS SHOULD HELP BUILD THE RIDGE TO THE EAST
OF THE HURRICANE AND ALLOW THE GENERAL NORTHEAST MOTION TO RESUME.
MOST OF THE OBJECTIVE TRACK AGREES ON A GENERAL NORTHEAST MOTION. 
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY BASED
ON THE TRACK UNCERTAINTY. 

THE INTENSITY FORECAST SHOWS GRADUAL WEAKENING THROUGH THE NEXT 
24 HOURS AS THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ENCOUNTERS AN INCREASING HOSTILE
UPPER-AIR ENVIRONMENT.  HOWEVER...IF LENNY STAYS QUASI-STATIONARY
LONG ENOUGH IT MAY WEAKEN MORE DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS THAN
FORECAST.  

BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.
 
AS A RESULT OF THE QUASI-STATIONARY MOTION...TROPICAL STORM WARNING
HAVE BEEN RETAINED FOR EASTERN PORTIONS OF PUERTO RICO WHILE
HURRICANE WARNING REMAIN POSTED FOR CULEBRA AND VIEQUES...AND THE
U.S. AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

DATA FROM THE SAN JUAN WSR-88D AND AIR FORCE RESERVE HURRICANE
HUNTER AIRCRAFT INDICATE THAT LENNY IS DRIFTING EAST..080/03. WHILE
THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS RISEN TO 947 MB...700 MB WINDS HAVE BEEN AS
HIGH AS 145 KT. AN EYEWALL DROPSONDE INDICATED 132 KT NEAR THE
SURFACE. BASED ON THIS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY REMAINS 125 KT.
 
LENNY IS CURRENT LOCATED BETWEEN A MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE TO THE
SOUTHEAST AND A BUILDING LOW/MID LEVEL TO THE NORTH...WHICH MAY BE
CAUSING THE CURRENT SLOWER MOTION. MODEL GUIDANCE HAS BECOME QUITE
DIVERSE...FROM THE UKMET SHOWING A SLOW NORTHWARD DRIFT TO THE BAMD
MOVING THE STORM EASTWARD. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. MAY COME CLOSE ENOUGH TO LENNY TO
NUDGE IT NORTHEASTWARD...AND THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS BASED ON THIS
AND SOME CONTINUITY FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. AN ALTERNATIVE
SCENARIO WOULD BE VERY LITTLE MOTION OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

LENNY IS STILL OVER WARM WATER AND IS SOUTH OF THE STRONG UPPER
LEVEL WESTERLIES. THEREFORE...ANY FURTHER WEAKENING SHOULD BE SLOW.
THE AVN AND UKMET ARE FORECASTING STRONG WESTERLIES TO CONTINUE
NORTH OF 20N. IF THE FORECAST NORTHEASTWARD MOTION OCCURS...THE
SHEAR SHOULD INCREASE AFTER 36 HOURS ALONG WITH COOLING SEA SURFACE
TEMPERATURES...WHICH SHOULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT WEAKENING.

FORECAST WIND RADII HAVE BEEN EXPANDED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE
HURRICANE IN ANTICIPATION OF THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE INCREASING THE
PRESSURE GRADIENT THERE.
 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HURRICANE AND THE TRACK FORECAST
UNCERTAINTIES...ONE MUST NOT FOCUS ON THE EXACT FORECAST TRACK.
 
AS A RESULT OF THE SLOW MOTION...TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS REMAIN IN
EFFECT FOR THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF PUERTO RICO WHILE HURRICANE
WARNING REMAIN POSTED FOR CULEBRA AND VIEQUES...AND THE U.S. AND

SAN JUAN WSR-88D INDICATES THAT LENNY HAS BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY
DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS.  BECAUSE STEERING CURRENTS ARE EXPECTED
TO REMAIN WEAK DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO...NO SIGNIFICANT
MOTION IS INDICATED THROUGH THAT PERIOD.  WV IMAGES SHOW AN EASTWARD
MOVING SHORT WAVE CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.
THIS FEATURE MAY PRODUCE AN INCREASE IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW NEAR
THE HURRICANE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...FORCING LENNY TO MOVE
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD AS INDICATED IN
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THIS IS THE GENERAL SOLUTION PROVIDED BY
MOST OF THE TRACK AND GLOBAL MODELS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE
RELIABLE AND GOOD PERFORMER UK MODEL WHICH KEEPS THE HURRICANE ON A
SLOW NORTHWARD TRACK.  ON THE UK MODEL...THE SHORTWAVE BYPASSES THE
HURRICANE...KEEPING LENNY SOUTH OF 25 DEGREES NORTH FOR AT LEAST 3
OR 4 DAYS.
 
THE EYE IS NOT LONGER VISIBLE ON SATELLITE IMAGES BUT IT IS WELL
DEFINED ON RADAR. BECAUSE BOTH THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS BEEN RISING
AND DVORAK T-NUMBERS ARE LOWER THAT YESTERDAY...INITIAL INTENSITY
IS 115 KNOTS. THERE IS NO SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM AND PERHAPS ONLY
UPWELLING IS CAUSING WEAKENING AT THIS TIME. SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY ARE FORECAST DURING THE NEXT DAY OR SO. THEREAFTER
...WEAKENING IS INDICATED AS LENNY MOVES TOWARD A LESS

PROPERLY ESTABLISHED...A PARAMETER I DO NOT KNOW TO FORECAST...THE
HURRICANE COULD OVERCOME THE SHEARING EFFECTS AND REMAIN STRONG A
LITTLE BIT LONGER.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
4 PM EST THU NOV 18 1999

RADAR...RECONNAISSANCE AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT THE
EYEWALL OF LENNY IS OVER ST. MAARTEN.   BECAUSE STEERING CURRENTS
ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN WEAK DURING THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO...ONLY A
VERY SLOW MOTION TOWARD THE EAST-NORTHEAST OR NORTHEAST IS INDICATED
THROUGH THAT PERIOD.  THIS MEANS THAT HURRICANE CONDITIONS SHOULD
CONTINUE OVER ST. MAARTEN AND ADJACENT ISLANDS FOR SEVERAL MORE
HOURS.  FORTUNATELY...RECON DATA INDICATE THAT LENNY IS NOT AS
STRONG AS IT WAS 24 HOUR AGO.  THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS HAVE
DECREASED TO 105 KNOTS AND THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS RISEN TO 966 MB.
HOWEVER...LENNY IS STILL A STRONG HURRICANE.  SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTENSITY ARE EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS BUT WEAKENING IS
INDICATED THEREAFTER...AS LENNY MOVES TOWARD A LESS FAVORABLE
UPPER-LEVEL WIND ENVIRONMENT.  IF THE THERMODYNAMICS ARE
PROPERLY ESTABLISHED...THE HURRICANE COULD OVERCOME THE SHEARING
EFFECTS AND REMAIN STRONG A LITTLE BIT LONGER. 

WV IMAGES SHOW AN EASTWARD MOVING SHORT WAVE CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER
THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.  THIS FEATURE MAY PRODUCE AN INCREASE IN
THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW NEAR THE HURRICANE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS...FORCING LENNY TO MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST LATER IN THE
FORECAST PERIOD AS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  THIS IS THE
GENERAL SOLUTION PROVIDED BY MOST OF THE TRACK AND GLOBAL MODELS.
 
BECAUSE THE HURRICANE IS MOVING AWAY FROM THE PUERTO RICO
RADAR...ITS EYE PRESENTATION IS POORLY DEFINED. THEREFORE...
ADVISORIES WILL NOW BE ISSUED EVERY 3 HOURS.

INFORMATION FROM DUTCH ST. MAARTEN THIS EVENING INCLUDES AN
UNOFFICIAL REPORT OF 100 MPH FROM A SHIP IN SIMSON BAY...AND
MULTIPLE REPORTS OF CALM WINDS...INDICATING THAT A PORTION OF THE
EYE PASSED OVER THE ISLAND.  MORE RECENTLY THE WIND HAS BEGUN TO
PICK UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST...BUT AT SPEEDS THAT SUGGEST THEY ARE NOT
YET FULLY IN THE SOUTHERN EYEWALL...AS THE CALM IS NOW BEING
REPORTED IN ANGUILLA.  THE MOST RECENT RECONNAISSANCE REPORTS SHOW
THAT THE MINIMUM PRESSURE CONTINUES TO RISE...UP 23 MB IN TWELVE
HOURS...AND THE MAXIMUM WINDS CONTINUE TO FALL.  THE AIRCRAFT
REPORTED 107 KT AND ON THIS BASIS THE INTENSITY IS LOWERED
TO 95 KT.  THIS BRINGS LENNY DOWN TO CATEGORY TWO STATUS ON THE
SAFFIR/SIMPSON SCALE.

LENNY HAS BEEN MEANDERING OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. MODEL GUIDANCE IS
WIDELY DIVERGENT THIS EVENING...WITH AN IMPORTANT DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE UKMET AND THE AVN.  BOTH MODELS INITIALIZE A MID-LEVEL
TROUGH OFF THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES.  WHILE THE AVN BRINGS A PIECE OF
THIS TROUGH SOUTHEASTWARD...RESULTING IN AN ACCELERATION OF LENNY
AWAY FROM THE ISLANDS...THE UKMET KEEPS THE TROUGH AWAY FROM THE
CYCLONE.  THIS RESULTS IN A MUCH SLOWER...AND LESS EASTWARD MOTION
OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  IN ADDITION...THE AVN ANALYZES ANOTHER
VORTEX ABOUT 400 NM NORTHEAST OF LENNY WHICH APPEARS TO CONTRIBUTE
TO THE ACCELERATION.  INTERESTINGLY...THE UKMET HAS BEEN MUCH CLOSER
TO THE ACTUAL TRACK OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS THAN THE AVN-BASED
GUIDANCE.  IN VIEW OF THIS...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND THE UKMET.  

LENNY HAS BEEN WEAKENING IN SPITE OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FAVORABLE
UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN.  THERE ARE SOME HINTS OF SOUTHWESTERLY
SHEAR UNDERCUTTING THE OUTFLOW HOWEVER.  PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO THE
SAME PATCH OF WATER MAY ALSO BE PLAYING A ROLE IN THE WEAKENING. 
THE SHIPS INTENSITY FORECAST MODEL SUGGESTS RAPID WEAKENING TO NEAR
MINIMAL HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 24 HOURS...BUT THIS IS BASED ON THE
AVN FORECAST SHEAR WHICH MAY NOT VERIFY.  I AM FORECASTING CONTINUED
SLOW WEAKENING.

DATA FROM WSR-88D DOPPLER RADAR IN SAN JUAN...AN AIR FORCE RESERVE
HURRICANE HUNTER...AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS IN ST. MAARTEN INDICATE
THE EYE OF LENNY DRIFTED ERRATICALLY SOUTHEAST EARLIER TONIGHT. IT
NOW APPEARS TO BE STATIONARY. ST. MAARTEN IS VERY NEAR THE WESTERN
EYEWALL...AS THE REPORTED WINDS HAVE BEEN VARYING BETWEEN SUSTAINED
HURRICANE FORCE AND LESS THAN 20 KT. THE AIRCRAFT REPORTS INDICATE A
CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 982 MB ALONG WITH 86 KT WINDS AT 700 MB. AN
EYEWALL DROPSONDE INDICATES 91 KT WINDS AT 951 MB. BASED ON
THIS...THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 85 KT...AND THIS MIGHT BE
A LITTLE GENEROUS.

LENNY APPEARS TO BE TRAPPED BETWEEN LOW/MID LEVEL RIDGES...AND THERE
APPARENTLY IS A LOW LEVEL TROUGH TO THE NORTH-NORTHEAST OF THE
HURRICANE. A MID/UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH SEEN IN WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY BETWEEN FLORIDA AND BERMUDA APPEARS WEAK...AND THEREFORE MAY
NOT HAVE AS MUCH IMPACT ON THE MOTION AS THE AVN MODEL OR AVN-BASED
HURRICANE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS. THE UKMET AND NOGAPS HAVE SLOWER
NORTHEASTWARD MOTIONS THAN THE AVN...PERHAPS DUE TO THE WEAKNESS OF
THE TROUGH. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
HURRICANE GUIDANCE...SIMILAR TO BUT SLOWER THAN THE GFDL.

LENNY CONTINUES TO WEAKEN IN SPITE OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FAVORABLE
UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW PATTERN.  HOWEVER...THERE ARE HINTS OF
SOUTHWESTERLY SHEAR UNDERCUTTING THE OUTFLOW.  PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO
THE SAME PATCH OF WATER MAY ALSO BE PLAYING A ROLE IN THE WEAKENING.
THE SHIPS MODEL CONTINUES TO SUGGEST RAPID WEAKENING TO NEAR
MINIMAL HURRICANE STRENGTH IN 24 HOURS...PARTLY DUE TO INCREASED
VERTICAL SHEAR. THE INTENSITY FORECAST CALLS FOR A MORE CONSERVATIVE
WEAKENING...DELAYING RAPID WEAKENING UNTIL LENNY MOVES INTO THE
STRONGER WESTERLIES NORTH OF 20N.

SATELLITE IMAGES AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT LENNY
CONTINUES TO MOVE ERRATICALLY AND THE EYE IS MEANDERING BETWEEN ST.
MAARTEN AND ANGUILLA.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT STEERING CURRENTS ARE
STILL WEAK.  HOWEVER...A SERIES OF EASTWARD MOVING SHORT WAVES OVER
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC COULD FINALLY PROVIDE ENOUGH SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW
TO STEER LENNY AWAY FROM THE NORTHEASTERN CARIBBEAN AS INDICATED IN
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST.  UNFORTUNATELY...THIS MOTION IS EXPECTED TO
BE VERY SLOW SO STRONG WINDS AND HEAVY RAINS COULD CONTINUE IN THE
AREA FOR AT LEAST 12 MORE HOURS.  MODELS HAVE NOT CHANGED THEIR TUNE
AND FOR SEVERAL DAYS HAVE BEEN INDICATING A FASTER NORTHEAST TRACK
THAT HAS NOT MATERIALIZED YET.  ENOUGH HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID ABOUT
MODEL OUTPUT.  

THERE HAS BEEN A GRADUAL WEAKENING SINCE YESTERDAY BUT THE HURRICANE
STILL HAS AN EXCELLENT OUTFLOW AND BANDING FEATURES.  THE INTENSITY
FORECAST CALLS FOR A CONTINUED WEAKENING AS THE HURRICANE MOVES INTO
A LESS FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT. SHIPS MODEL INDICATE THAT ALL THE
FACTORS ARE AGAINST STRENGTHENING.  ON THE OTHER HAND...THE UK MODEL
INDICATE THAT LENNY COULD REINTENSIFY SOME.  TIME WILL TELL.

PATTERN HAS BECOME LESS SYMMETRIC AND THE LOW LEVEL CENTER IS
LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CONVECTION. THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME
SHEARING BUT AT THE CIRRUS LEVEL.....IR IMAGES REVEAL THAT THE

RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WHICH MEASURED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE
OF 994 MB.  LENNY IS BEING DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM AT THIS

SURPRISED IF IT RESTRENGTHENS WHILE MOVING OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC.  
 
LENNY HAS BEEN MEANDERING OR MOVING ERRATICALLY DURING THE PAST 6 TO

THE CENTER IS NOT EASY TO LOCATE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY.  THE WIND AT
COOLIDGE AIRPORT ON ANTIGUA HAS SHIFTED FROM 220/10 TO 100/08 DURING
THE PAST HOUR WHICH INDICATES THAT THE CENTER PASSED VERY CLOSE TO
THIS LOCATION.  THE INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS 120/03.  THE GUIDANCE
...WHICH IS STILL BASED ON THE 12Z MODEL RUNS IS DIVERGENT.  THE
NOGAPS SHOWS VERY LITTLE MOTION FOR 72 HOURS.  THE UKMET SHOWS A
NORTHEASTWARD MOTION AT ABOUT 5 KNOTS FOR 72 HOURS.  THE GFDL IS
NORTHEASTWARD ABOUT 10 KNOTS.  THE AVIATION IS DUE NORTHWARD AT
ABOUT 5 KNOTS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO AND AN UPDATE OF
THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY SHOWING A SLOW EAST TO NORTHEASTWARD MOTION
FOR 72 HOURS.  BUT THE FIRST 24 HOURS OF MOTION COULD BE QUITE SLOW
AND IT COULD BE QUITE SOME TIME BEFORE THE HEAVY RAIN AND WINDS COME
TO AN END OVER PORTIONS OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.  THE EAST-
SOUTHEASTWARD MOTION WILL BRING THE CENTER RATHER CLOSE TO GUADELOPE
...BUT THE WEATHER IS NOT CONCENTRATED AROUND THE CENTER AND THE
WEATHER AT GUADELOUPE AND FURTHER SOUTH IS NOT LIKELY TO GET ANY
WORSE THAN IT HAS BEEN.
 
DURING THE PAST SIX HOURS...THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS BURST OF
DEEP CONVECTION NEAR AND TO THE EAST OF THE CENTER.  THIS COULD
DELAY THE ONGOING WEAKENING TREND AND THE OFFICIAL WIND SPEED
FORECAST IS A LITTLE SLOWER IN WEAKENING LENNY THAN THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY.

RECONNAISSANCE OBSERVATIONS THIS MORNING...THE LAST WE WILL HAVE ON
THIS SYSTEM...SHOW THAT LENNY IS NOT A WELL-ORGANIZED TROPICAL
STORM.  ALTHOUGH THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 1000 MB
FROM TWO DROPSONDES...BOTH GUADELOUPE AND ANTIGUA...WELL TO THE
WEST...HAVE REPORTED LOWER PRESSURES.  WINDS FROM THE LAST EYE DROP
SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT LOW TO MID LEVEL WESTERLY SHEAR AND REQUIRE THE
SURFACE CENTER TO BE A BIT SOUTH OF THE RECON FIX LOCATION.  THE
ONLY STRONG WINDS REPORTED AT THE 700 MB LEVEL WERE IN CONVECTION
WELL TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER.  BASED ON THESE WINDS...THE
INITIAL INTENSITY IS REDUCED TO 50 KT.  SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO
THE WIND RADII HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE.  THE MOST RECENT INTENSITY
FORECAST GUIDANCE FROM THE SHIPS MODEL CONTINUES THE CURRENT
WEAKENING TREND. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS CLOSE TO THIS GUIDANCE.

LENNY IS FINALLY MAKING GOOD PROGRESS OUT OF THE CARIBBEAN...WITH AN
INITIAL MOTION OF 115/6.  ALL MODEL GUIDANCE TURNS LENNY FROM ITS
CURRENT EAST-SOUTHEASTERLY TRACK TO THE NORTH OR NORTHEAST
IMMEDIATELY IF NOT SOONER.  I AM A LITTLE DOUBTFUL OF THIS...GIVEN
THE RECENT TRACK OF THE STORM...AN UNCONVINCING INITIALIZATION IN
THE AVN...AND THE POOR VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF THE VORTEX. 
NONETHELESS...I HAVE MADE ONLY A MODEST EASTWARD ADJUSTMENT OF THE
OFFICIAL TRACK.

WITH LENNY MOVING OUT OF THE CARIBBEAN...AND ALL SIGNIFICANT WEATHER
EAST OF THE CENTER...ALL REMAINING WARNINGS ARE DISCONTINUED WITH
THIS ADVISORY.  ALL INTERESTS IN THE LEEWARD ISLANDS SHOULD EXERCISE
DUE CAUTION UNTIL SEAS SUBSIDE.

TO THE EAST OF THE CENTER...AND SATELLITE INTENSITY ESTIMATES RANGE
FROM 30 TO 45 KT...WITH T NUMBERS OF 25-30 KT.  THEREFORE LENNY IS
DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION.  THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION IS
BECOMING ELONGATED IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE FIRST STAGE OF TERMINAL
DISSIPATION.

THE 6Z WIND FROM BUOY 41100 WAS FROM THE WEST-SOUTHWEST...WHICH
INDICATES THAT LENNY HAS FINALLY BEGUN ITS LONG-FORECAST LEFT TURN.
THE INITIAL MOTION IS NOW 060/8.  THE MULTI-SPECTRAL NIGHT IR
IMAGERY SHOWS A WEAK LOW-LEVEL VORTEX NORTH OF PUERTO RICO.  THIS IS
PRESUMBABLY THE VORTEX THE AVN HAS BEEN ANALYZING FOR THE PAST
COUPLE OF DAYS.  LENNY...OR ITS REMNANTS...IS EXPECTED TO MOVE
SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD AROUND THIS VORTEX BEFORE MODESTLY ACCELERATING
LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  GIVEN THE NEW HEADING OF THE
DEPRESSION...THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS ADJUSTED TO THE LEFT OF THE
PREVIOUS ADVISORY.

10 AM EST SUN NOV 21 1999
 
SATELLITE AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT LENNY IS RAPIDLY
WEAKENING AND CONSISTS OF A LARGE BUT DISORGANIZED LOW-CLOUD CENTER
OF CIRCULATION WITH A CONVECTIVE CURVED BAND TO THE EAST.  FURTHER
WEAKENING IS ANTICIPATED AND LENNY WILL PROBABLY DISSIPATE IN 12 TO
24 HOURS.
 
THE EXPECTED NORTHEAST TRACK HAS FINALLY MATERIALIZED. THE
DEPRESSION IS MOVING 045/12 AND NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN MOTION IS
INDICATED BEFORE DISSIPATION.

SATELLITE AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT LENNY CONTINUES TO
WEAKEN AND IS NOW A SWIRL OF LOW CLOUDS OR A BROAD AREA OF LOW
PRESSURE  WITH A FEW SQUALLS TO THE EAST.  THIS SYSTEM IS FORECAST
TO MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHEAST WITH AN INCREASE IN FORWARD SPEED AND
AWAY FROM THE CARIBBEAN.  THE LOW COULD DISSIPATE OR BECOME AN
EXTRATROPICAL LOW  AS INDICATED BY THE UK MODEL.
